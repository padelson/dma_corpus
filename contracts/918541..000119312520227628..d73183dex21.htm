Expenses, together with supporting documentation and work papers describing in
reasonable detail how such specific items were derived, calculated or
otherwise determined (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). If Seller does not
deliver the Notice of Disagreement within the Seller Notice Period, then
Seller will be deemed to have agreed to the Post-Closing Statement and the
computation of the Purchase Price set forth therein will be final, conclusive
and binding on the Parties for all purposes hereunder.

(c) If Seller delivers the Notice of Disagreement within the Seller Notice
Period, Purchaser and Seller, during the thirty (30) days following such
delivery, will cooperate in good faith to reach agreement in writing on the
disputed items or amounts in order to determine the Final Purchase Price. If
the Parties so resolve all disputes, the computation of the Purchase Price
agreed upon by the Parties, will be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties for all purposes hereunder.

 

(d) If Seller delivers a Notice of Disagreement within the Seller Notice
Period, and Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach an agreement on the
disputed items within the period described in _Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_, the
Parties will jointly engage an independent nationally recognized accounting
firm to be agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller (the "
_Independent Accountant_ ") (with the initial engagement costs paid fifty
(50%) by Purchaser and fifty (50%) by Seller, and with the contribution of
such costs by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, reimbursed or credited
following the final allocation of fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accountant pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.5(d)_), to review this Agreement
and solely the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the
Final Purchase Price (it being understood that, in making such calculation,
the Independent Accountant will function as an expert and not as an
arbitrator). The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent
Accountant shall be limited to correcting mathematical errors and determining
whether the items and amounts in dispute were determined in accordance with
the Accounting Principles and this Agreement, and the Independent Accountant
is not to make any other determination, including any determination as
to whether the definition of "Target Net Working Capital" is adequate or
sufficient. In making its calculation of the Final Purchase Price, the
Independent Accountant (i) will apply the Accounting Principles including
definitions of "Net Working Capital," "Closing Cash," "Closing Indebtedness"
and "Acquired Companies Transaction Expenses" in this Agreement, (ii) will
consider only those items or amounts in the Post-Closing Statement as to
which Seller specifically disputes in the Notice of Disagreement and (iii)
will not assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value
for such item assigned by Purchaser or Seller or less than the smallest value
for such item assigned by Purchaser or Seller in the Post-Closing Statement
or the Notice of Disagreement, as applicable. The Independent Accountants
decision shall be based solely on written submissions by Purchaser and Seller
and their respective Representatives and in no event shall any Party engage
in any ex parte communications with the Independent Accountant. Purchaser and
Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Independent Accountant to deliver to Purchaser and Seller, as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within thirty (30) days after the date of

 



5

    

 engagement of the Independent Accountant), a report setting forth its
calculation of the Final Purchase Price. The Independent Accountants
calculation of the Final Purchase Price will be final, conclusive and binding
on the Parties for all purposes hereunder. Subject to the following sentence,
the costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to this subsection, including the
fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant and of any enforcement
of the determination thereof, shall be borne by Purchaser and Seller in
proportion to the final allocation made by the Independent Accountant of the
disputed items weighted in relation to the claims made by Purchaser and
Seller, such that the prevailing Party pays the lesser proportion of such
fees, costs and expenses. For example, if Seller claims that the appropriate
adjustments are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by Purchaser and if
the Independent Accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to
Seller $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be allocated thirty percent (30%) (i.e. 300
_divided by_ 1,000) to Purchaser and seventy percent (70%) (i.e. 700 _divided
by_ 1,000) to Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the fees and
disbursements of the Representatives of each Party incurred in connection with
their preparation or review of the Post-Closing Statement and preparation or
review of any Notice of Disagreement, as applicable, shall be borne by such
Party.

(e) The final, conclusive and binding Purchase Price as determined in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_, _(c)_ and _(d)_ , will be referred to
as the " _Final Purchase Price_."

 

(f) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price
(such excess, the " _Purchase Price Excess Amount_ "), Purchaser will
promptly, and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after
determination of the Final Purchase Price in accordance with this _Section_ __
_ 1.5_, pay or cause to be paid to Seller an aggregate amount equal to the
Purchase Price Excess Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the Seller Account.

(g) If the sum of the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated
Purchase Price (such deficit, the " _Purchase Price Deficit Amount_ "), Seller
will promptly, and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after
determination of the Final Purchase Price in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 1.5_, pay to Purchaser an aggregate amount equal to the Purchase Price
Deficit Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
specified by Purchaser.

Section 1.6 _Withholding Rights_.

 

(a) Purchaser and the Acquired Companies shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as they are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of any
other Tax Law (except as provided in Section 6.3(i)). To the extent that
such amounts are to be withheld and timely paid to the proper Taxing
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. Before making any deduction or withholding pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) give the Seller five (5) days advance notice of any anticipated
deduction or withholding (together with the legal basis therefor), (ii)
provide the Seller with sufficient opportunity to provide any forms or other
documentation or take such other steps in order to avoid such deduction or
withholding, and (iii) reasonably cooperate with the Seller in good faith to
attempt to reduce any amounts that would otherwise be deducted and withheld
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_.

Section 1.7 _Earn-Out Payments_

 

(a) _Earn-Out Payments_. For the twelve (12) month period ended December 31,
2022 (the " _Earn-Out Period_"), as additional consideration for the
transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to
Seller, in cash, an amount as determined in accordance with this _Section_ __
_ 1.7_ (the " _Earn-Out Amount_"). Within thirty (30) days following delivery
of the Companys audited consolidated statement of financial position or
balance sheet of the Company as at the end of the Earn-Out Period and the
related audited consolidated income statement, audited consolidated statement
of comprehensive income, audited consolidated statement of cash flows and
audited consolidated statement of changes in equity (the " _Audited Financial
Statements_ ") for the Earn-Out Period by a "Big 4" or other
nationally recognized independent certified public accountant registered with
the PCAOB (the " _Purchaser Auditor_ "), Purchaser shall (i) prepare a good
faith calculation (the " _Proposed  Earn-Out Calculation_") of Adjusted
EBITDA for the Earn-Out Period and the applicable amount payable in connection
with the Earn-Out Amount, if any, as determined in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 1.7(b)_ (any such amount, as applicable, the " _Proposed Earn-
Out Amount_"), and (ii) deliver to Seller a copy of the Proposed Earn-Out
Calculation together with such Audited Financial Statements and other
supporting documentation describing in reasonable detail how the Proposed
Earn-Out Amount was calculated or otherwise determined (the " _Earn-Out
Statement_"). Following the final and conclusive determination of the Earn-
Out Amount in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.7_ (the " _Final Earn-Out
__Amount_ "), if the Final Earn-Out Amount exceeds $0.00, Purchaser shall, as
promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after
such final determination, pay, or cause to be paid, the applicable Earn-Out
Amount to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Seller.

 

(b) _Determination of Earn-Out Amounts_. The Earn-Out Amount shall be
determined as follows:

(i) if the Adjusted EBITDA for the Earn-Out Period is equal to or greater
than $115,000,000 (the " _Maximum EBITDA Target_ "), the Earn-Out Amount for
such period shall be $70,000,000 (the " _Maximum  Earn-Out Amount_"); or

(ii) if the Adjusted EBITDA for the Earn-Out Period is greater than or equal
to $100,000,000 (the " _Minimum EBITDA Target_ ") but less than the Maximum
EBITDA Target, the Earn-Out Amount for such period shall be an amount equal
to (x) if the Adjusted EBITDA is equal to the Minimum EBITDA Target,
$15,000,000 (the " _Minimum Earn-Out Amount_"), or (y) if the Adjusted
EBITDA is greater than the Minimum EBITDA Target but less than the Maximum
EBITDA Target, a proportionate amount between the Minimum Earn-Out Amount and
the Maximum Earn-Out Amount, calculated on a straight line basis as follows:
Minimum Earnout Amount + ((Adjusted EBITDA - Minimum EBITDA Target)/(Maximum
EBITDA Target - Minimum EBITDA Target)) X (Maximum Earnout Amount - Minimum
Earnout Amount); it being understood that if Adjusted EBITDA for the Earn-Out
Period is less than $100,000,000, the Earn-Out Amount shall be zero (0).

 



7

    

For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in no event shall the aggregate Earn-Out Amount exceed
$70,000,000.

(c) _Resolution of Earn-Out Dispute_.

(i) Within forty-five (45) days of receiving the Earn-Out Statement from
Purchaser (the " _Earn-Out Notice Period_"), Seller may dispute specific items
in the Proposed Earn-Out Calculation set forth in the Earn-Out Statement by
delivering to Purchaser a written notice of dispute, setting forth Sellers
good faith calculation of the Earn-Out Amount, together with supporting
documentation describing in reasonable detail how such specific items were
derived, calculated or otherwise determined (the " _Earn-Out Notice of
Disagreement_"). During the Earn-Out Notice Period, Seller and its
representatives shall be given reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to or copies of (as Seller shall
request), solely relevant for the purpose of verifying the Earn-Out Statement
and upon execution of a customary access letter if required by Purchasers
outside accountants, if applicable: (A) all of the books and records, work
papers, trial balances and other materials relating to the Earn-Out Statement;
and (B) Purchasers and the Acquired Companies personnel and accountants.

(ii) If Seller does not deliver an Earn-Out Notice of Disagreement in
accordance with the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 1.7(c)(i)_, Seller shall
be deemed to have agreed to the Earn-Out Statement delivered by Purchaser
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_ and such Earn-Out Statement and the
computation of the Proposed Earn-Out Amount set forth therein shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties for all purposes hereunder.

(iii) If Seller delivers an Earn-Out Notice of Disagreement in accordance with
the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 1.7(c)(i)_, Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate in good faith to reach agreement in writing on the disputed items
or amounts in order to determine the Final Earn-Out Amount. If the Parties so
resolve all disputes, the computation of the Earn-Out Amount agreed upon by
the Parties, will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties for all
purposes hereunder.

(iv) If Seller delivers an Earn-Out Notice of Disagreement in accordance with
the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 1.7(c)(i)_ and Purchaser and Seller are
unable to reach agreement on the disputed items pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
1.7(c)(iii)_, then Purchaser and Seller shall each be entitled to submit only
the matters that remain in dispute to the Independent Accountant, who shall
act in accordance with the standards set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 1.5(d)_,
which shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ , except that the Independent Accountant

discretion to make business decisions and take actions that may affect the
Acquired Business and the Acquired Companies as Purchaser shall determine are

satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Purchaser or, to the knowledge of
Purchaser, the Sponsors or any other party thereto under the Financing

the other payment obligations of Purchaser contemplated hereunder (the "
_Required Funds_ "). Purchaser affirms that it is not a condition to the
Closing or any of its other obligations under this Agreement that Purchaser
obtains the Financing or any other financing for or related to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.5 _Litigation_. There is no Action (including governmental and
administrative Actions) by or against Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries or
Affiliates pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened, or any
outstanding Order, in each case, that if determined adversely to Purchaser,
would reasonably be expected to result in a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.6 _Investment Intent; Compliance with Laws_. Purchaser is acquiring
the Acquired Shares for its own account with the present intention of holding
such securities for investment purposes and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution of such securities in violation of

Section 4.7 _Independent Investigation_. Purchaser is an informed and
sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert advisors, experienced in the
evaluation and purchase of property and assets such as the Acquired Shares and
the Acquired Companies as contemplated hereunder. Purchaser has undertaken
such investigation and has been provided with documents and information
to enable it to make an informed decision with respect to the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller
has given Purchaser access to certain employees, documents and facilities of
the Acquired Business. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Acquired
Companies and the Acquired Shares are sold "as-is", except as expressly set
forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement (including as modified by the
Disclosure Letter thereto). Purchaser agrees to accept the Acquired Shares,
the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Business in the condition they are in
on the Closing Date based on its own inspection, examination and determination
with respect to all matters, and Purchaser expressly acknowledges and agrees
that it is not relying on (and Purchaser and its Affiliates expressly disclaim
reliance on), any express or implied representations or warranties of any
nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller, except as expressly set
forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement including as modified by the
Disclosure Letter _,_ thereto. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except as 

 



33

    

 expressly set forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement (including as
modified by the Disclosure Letter thereto), Purchaser acknowledges that Seller
makes no representation or warranty with respect to any projections,
estimates or budgets delivered to or made available to Purchaser or its
Representatives of future revenues, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or
any component thereof) of the Acquired Business or the future business and
operations of the Acquired Business.

Section 4.8  _Solvency_. Assuming that (x) the representations and warranties
of Seller and the Acquired Companies contained in this Agreement or in any
Transaction Document or certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement are
true and correct in all respects, (y) the conditions to the obligation of
Purchaser to consummate the Transactions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_ have been satisfied or waived and (z) the
Financial Statements fairly presents the consolidated financial condition of
the Acquired Companies for the periods covered thereby, then immediately
following the Closing and after giving effect to all of the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Reorganization, the Financing,
the payment of the Estimated Purchase Price, funding of any obligations of
Purchaser or its subsidiaries which become due or payable by Purchaser and its
subsidiaries in connection with, or as a result of, the Transactions and
payment of all related fees and expenses, Purchaser and its subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, will not: (i) be insolvent (either because its financial
condition is such that the sum of their debts, including contingent and other
liabilities, is greater than the fair market value of their assets or because
the fair saleable value of their assets is less than the amount required to
pay their probable liability on their existing debts, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature); (ii) have unreasonably
small capital for the operation of the businesses in which they are engaged or
proposed to be engaged; or (iii) have incurred debts, or be expected to incur
debts, including contingent and other liabilities, beyond their ability to
pay them as they become due.

Section 4.9 _Brokers_. No broker, agent, finder or investment banker is
entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or similar commission in
connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Purchaser.

 

Section 4.10 _Ownership of Shares_. Neither Purchaser, nor any of its
Affiliates (including for purposes hereof, portfolio companies of American
Securities LLC or its Affiliates) beneficially owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3
under the Exchange Act) any shares of common stock of Seller (" _Seller
Shares_ ") or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for Seller Shares, or holds any rights to acquire or vote any
Seller Shares. Neither Purchaser nor any of its respective "affiliates" or
"associates" (as such terms are defined in Section 203 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ")) is, or has been at
any time within the three (3) year period immediately prior to the date
hereof, an "interested stockholder" of Seller (as such term is defined in
Section 203 of the DGCL).

Section 4.11 _Exclusivity of Representations_. The representations and
warranties made by Purchaser in this _Article IV_ are the exclusive
representations and warranties made by Purchaser. Purchaser hereby disclaims
any other express or implied representations or warranties with respect to
any information provided to Seller, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives. Neither Purchaser, nor any of its
Representatives shall have or be subject to any liability to Seller, the
Company or any other Person in respect of the accuracy or completeness of any
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material provided to
Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this  _Section_ __ _ 4.11_ shall not waive
any claim or right of Purchaser or its Affiliates in any case of Actual Fraud
by Seller, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates.

COVENANTS PENDING CLOSING

 

Section 5.1 _Reorganization_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and its applicable Affiliates shall
consummate the Reorganization in accordance with the steps set forth in
_Exhibit E_ (the " _Reorganization Plan_ "), and take such additional action
as may be necessary such that (i) the Acquired Companies hold at the Closing
any Acquired Business Assets held by Seller or any of its subsidiaries other
than the Acquired Companies (other than those Delayed-Transfer Assets that are
unable to be transferred at or prior to Closing in accordance with this
Agreement), (ii) the Seller-Retained Subsidiaries hold the Seller-
Retained Assets at the Closing and (iii) the Company shall transfer, in
accordance with applicable law, to Seller immediately prior to Closing, the
Seller-Retained Subsidiaries. Following the date of this Agreement but prior
to Closing, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be permitted to
amend _Exhibit E_ without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Seller and its Affiliates shall execute and
deliver all documents, make all filings, arrange for and undertake all related
actions that Seller and the Company determine to be necessary and appropriate
to consummate the Reorganization; provided, that all such documents, filings
or similar documents shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser prior to the execution thereof. All fees, costs and expenses
incurred by any Seller, the Acquired Companies, Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates in connection with the Reorganization shall be borne by
Seller.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, there shall be excluded from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Reorganization) any asset, Real
Property Lease, Permit or other Contract or right not owned by an Acquired
Company which is not assignable or transferable without the consent of any
Person other than Seller, the Acquired Companies or any subsidiary of Seller
or Purchaser, to the extent that such consent shall not have been given prior
to the Closing (i) (the " _Delayed-Transfer Assets_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that each of Seller and Purchaser shall have the continuing obligation until
twelve (12) months after the Closing to use their best efforts to (x) in the
case of assets referred to in clause (i) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_,
obtain all necessary consents to the assignment or transfer thereof, thereof,
provided, that any expenses or costs payable to any third party in connection
with obtaining such consents that Seller and Purchaser agree to pay in
connection with such consent shall be equally borne by Purchaser and Seller,
it being understood that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
or subsidiaries shall be required to commence any litigation or offer or
grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise). Upon obtaining the requisite
third-party consents thereto, such Delayed-Transfer Assets, if otherwise
includable in the transactions contemplated hereby, shall promptly be
transferred and assigned hereunder to Purchaser or one of its subsidiaries or
Seller or one of its subsidiaries, as applicable; _provided_ , however, that
all fees, costs and expenses incurred by any Seller, the Acquired Companies,
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with any such
transfer or assignment shall be borne by Seller.

 



35

    

(c) With respect to any Delayed-Transfer Asset that is not transferred or
assigned to Purchaser or one of the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, or
Seller or one of the Seller-Retained Subsidiaries, as applicable, in the
Reorganization or otherwise at the Closing by reason of _Section_ __ _
5.1(a)_, after the Closing, until any requisite consent is obtained therefor
and the same is transferred and assigned to Purchaser or one of the Acquired
Companies, on the one hand, or Seller or one of the Seller-Retained
Subsidiaries, as applicable, the Parties shall cooperate with each other,
upon written request of Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, in endeavoring to
obtain for Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, at no cost to Purchaser, Seller
or their respective Affiliates, as applicable, an arrangement with respect
thereto to provide the applicable Party substantially comparable benefits
therein. Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, agrees to indemnify the providing
Party and their Affiliates in respect of all Liabilities of the providing
Party in respect of any such arrangement, continuing operations and
underlying lease, license, Contract, agreement or right.

(d) Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to the Real
Property Leases, Permits or other Contracts or rights and that such consents
may not be obtained. Without limiting any representation, warranty or
covenant of Seller hereunder, Purchaser agrees that neither Seller nor any of
its Affiliates shall have any liability to Purchaser or its Affiliates arising
out of or relating to the failure to receive any such consent, and no
condition shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of such failure or any
Action commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any person arising out of or
relating to the failure to receive any such consent.

 

Section 5.2 _Conduct of Business_. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance

attempted mitigation) of health and safety risks associated with any Contagion
Event or as recommended or mandated by a Governmental Entity in
response thereto, (y) to the extent relating exclusively to any Seller-
Retained Subsidiary or Seller-Retained Asset or (z) as Purchaser shall
otherwise consent in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), Seller shall, and shall cause each of the
Acquired Companies and its and their respective Affiliates (including the
Seller-Retained Subsidiaries) to, directly or indirectly conduct the Acquired
Business in the ordinary course and to use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain and preserve substantially intact the Acquired Business and its
material business organizations, property, goodwill and business relationships
with Governmental Entities, employees, independent contractors,
service providers, agents, customers, suppliers, creditors, lessors and other
stakeholders and Seller shall not, and shall cause the Acquired Companies not

take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations
to consummate the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party hereto agrees to, and to

proceeding by a private party, with any other Person. No Party shall
independently participate in any substantive meeting or communication with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation or other
inquiry relating to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ or this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_

_provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall require 

 



40

    

 Purchaser to (x) propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent
decree, hold separate orders or otherwise, the sale, divesture, disposition,
or license of any assets, properties, products, rights, services or business
of Purchaser, Purchasers subsidiaries, or their respective Affiliates (other
than the Acquired Companies) and (y) otherwise take or commit to take actions
that would limit Purchasers Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies)
freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to retain any
assets, properties, products, rights, services or businesses of Purchasers
Affiliates; _provided_ _further_  that Purchaser shall not be required to
take (and Seller and the Acquired Companies shall not take, without
Purchasers prior written consent) any actions under this _Section_ __ _
5.3(c)_ that would result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired
Companies.

(d) Subject to the obligations under _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_, in the event
that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party
challenging any of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any
other agreement contemplated hereby, (i) each of Purchaser and Seller shall,
and Purchaser shall cause each member of the Purchaser Group to, cooperate in
all respects with each other and use its respective best efforts to contest

prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) Purchaser and Seller
must defend, at their own cost and expense, any action or actions, whether
judicial or administrative, in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Seller nor any of
its subsidiaries shall be required to agree to any term or take any action in
connection with its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ that is not
conditioned upon consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Purchaser, the Sponsors, and their controlled Affiliates shall not
acquire or agree to acquire, directly or indirectly, by merging with or into
or consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity
in, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership,
association or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise
acquire or agree to acquire any assets or equity interests, if the entering
into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of such
acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to: (i)
impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk
of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the
risk of any Governmental Entity seeking or entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii)

redacted available to the other Party. Materials provided to the other Party
or its counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation
of the Acquired Business, privileged communications, or other competitively
sensitive material.

Section 5.4 _Access to Information_. From the date hereof to the Closing Date
or the earlier termination of this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written
notice (email being sufficient) from Purchaser, Seller shall, and shall cause
the Acquired Companies, its other subsidiaries, officers, directors and
employees to, afford Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable access,
consistent with applicable Law, during normal business hours, relating to the
Acquired Business, including the officers, employees, properties and the books
and records of the Acquired Business, as necessary to facilitate consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
Seller or its subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference
with the discharge by such officers, employees and other authorized
Representatives of their normal duties in the ordinary course and, subject
to  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, shall not include any environmental sampling or
testing of any kind. Neither Seller nor any of its subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of Seller or any of
its subsidiaries, or contravene any applicable Law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, decree or binding agreement entered into prior the date of this
Agreement. Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser, for a period beginning
after the date of this Agreement and ending on the Closing Date as soon as
practicable after the end of the each calendar month, but no later than 30

statements of the Acquired Business prepared by management and made available
in the ordinary course of business to the board of directors of Seller.

 

Section 5.5 _Notification_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller
shall give prompt notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall give prompt notice
to Seller, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such Party
from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions contemplated
hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may
be required in connection with the Transactions contemplated herein, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain
such consent would materially delay, impair or prevent the consummation of
the Transactions or the performance by a Party of the obligations, covenants
and agreements set forth in this Agreement or in any Transaction Document, and
(ii) any Actions commenced or, to such Partys knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of its
subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ shall
not (A) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of
this Agreement or (B) limit the remedies available to the Party receiving such
notice. The Parties agree and acknowledge that Sellers, on the one hand, and
Purchasers, on the other hand, compliance or failure of compliance with this
_Section_ __ _ 5.5_ shall not be taken into account for purposes of
determining whether the condition referred to in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)(iv)_
or _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)(ii)_, respectively, shall have been satisfied with
respect to performance in all material respects with this _Section_ __ _
5.5_.

 

Section 5.6 _Purchaser Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain the Financing on the terms and subject to the conditions
described in or contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters, including
using its reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in full force and effect
the Financing Commitments, (ii) satisfy on or prior to the Closing Date all
conditions to funding applicable to Purchaser in the Debt Commitment Letter
and/or the definitive agreements with respect thereto (the " _Debt Financing
Documents_ " and, together with the definitive agreements

 



42

    

 for the Equity Financing, collectively, the " _Financing Documents_ ")
(including by consummating the Equity Financing at or prior to Closing), (iii)
negotiate and enter into the Debt Financing Documents prior to the Closing
Date on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions contained therein)
or otherwise on terms that would not (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing below the amount necessary for Purchaser to pay the Required
Funds or (B) impose new or material conditions precedent to the receipt of the
Debt Financing, in the case of this _clause _ _(B)_ , that would reasonably
be expected to delay or prevent Closing, (iv) consummate the Debt Financing on
or prior to the Closing Date (it being understood that it is not a condition
to Closing under this Agreement for Purchaser to obtain the Debt Financing or
any Alternative Financing) and (v) enforcing its rights under the Debt
Financing Commitments (other than through litigation). Purchaser shall obtain
the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Financing Commitment upon
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Closing in _Section_ __ _ 2.2_
and _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions at the Closing). To the extent requested by Seller from time
to time, Purchaser shall keep Seller informed on a reasonably current basis of
any material developments in respect of the status of the conditions
precedent to the funding of, or availability of, the Debt Financing (or
Alternative Financing), and upon reasonable request, Purchaser shall provide
to Seller copies of all material documents related to the Financing (or
Alternative Financing) or any other document related to the Financing (or
Alternative Financing) affecting any rights or obligations of Seller or its
Affiliates (if any). In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letter (after taking into account the "market flex" provisions thereof) such
that the aggregate Debt Financing that is available, when taken together with
the Purchasers existing cash on hand and the aggregate amount of Equity
Financing, is insufficient to satisfy the Required Funds, Purchaser shall, as
promptly and practicable following the occurrence of such event, use
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing, including from
alternative sources, that provides for financing (A) on terms that are not
materially less favorable (including with respect to "market flex" provisions
and conditions to the availability and funding of the Debt Financing), in the
aggregate to Purchaser than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter (the " _Alternative Financing_ "), (B) in an amount, when
added with Purchasers existing cash on hand, the Equity Financing
Commitments and any portion of the Debt Financing Commitments that are
available, that is not less than the Required Funds and (C) which would not
(x) involve any new or additional conditions to funding the Debt Financing
that would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing and (y)
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the
Debt Financing or such Alternative Financing or the Transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Purchaser shall reasonably promptly notify Seller in writing (i) if there
exists any material breach, default, legal repudiation, cancellation or
termination by any party to any Financing Commitment Letter of which the
Purchaser becomes aware, which material breach, default, legal repudiation,
cancellation or termination would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the conditions to, availability of or amount of the applicable Financing,
(ii) of the receipt by Purchaser of any written notice or other written
communication from the Sponsor or any Debt Financing Source with respect to
any actual breach, default, cancellation or termination by such Sponsor, the
parties to the Equity Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Source or (iii)
if for any reason Purchaser or Sponsors believes in good faith that there is a
reasonable possibility that all or any portion of the Financing will be
unavailable on the Closing Date;

 



43

    

  _provided_ that nothing in this sentence shall require Purchaser to
disclose any information if making such information available would (i)
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, or (ii) contravene any applicable
Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement (including any confidentiality
agreement to which Purchaser is a party) (it being understood that Purchaser
will cooperate in any reasonable efforts and requests for waivers or other
mechanisms that would enable otherwise required disclosure to occur without
contravening such Law, duty or agreement or jeopardizing any attorney-client
privilege). Other than as set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_ with
respect to any Alternative Financing, Purchaser shall not (without the prior
written consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed)) consent or agree to any amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification to, or any waiver of any conditions or contingencies to funding
contained in the Financing Commitment Letters or Financing Documents if such
amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver would reasonably
be expected to (1) decrease the aggregate amount of the Financing to an amount
that would be less than amount that would be required to consummate the
Transactions and pay the Required Funds (other than by operation of
the "market flex" provisions relating to the Debt Financing so long as such
reduced amount, when taken together with the Purchasers existing cash on hand
and the aggregate amount of Equity Financing, is sufficient to satisfy the
Required Funds), (2) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand,
amend or modify any of the existing conditions to the receipt of the Financing
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing,
(3) prevent, impede or delay Purchasers ability to consummate the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date or (4)
adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Financing Commitment Letters; _provided_ , _however_ ,
for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser may amend, replace, supplement and/or
modify the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities as parties thereto who had not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. The provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall be applicable to any Alternative Financing,
and, for the purposes of  _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ and the entirety of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_, all references to the "Debt Financing", "Financing" or
"Financing Commitments" shall be deemed to include such Alternative Financing
and all references to the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing Documents
shall include the applicable documents for the Alternative Financing and, in
each case, any amendments thereof or replacements, supplements
or modifications thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by
Purchaser with this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall not relieve Purchaser of its
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
whether or not the Financing is available and Purchaser acknowledges that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are not contingent on
Purchasers ability to obtain the Financing (including any Alternative
Financing) or any specific term with respect to such financing.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to provide
to Purchaser, and shall cause the Acquired Companies and its and their
subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to provide to Purchaser, at
Purchasers sole cost and expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by
Purchaser in connection with the Financing (or any Alternative Financing
obtained in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.6(a))_, including using
reasonable best efforts to take the following actions: (i) to the extent
reasonably available to Seller, as promptly as practicable, furnishing
Purchaser with the Required Information and such financial information with
respect to the Acquired Companies, including the financial information as may
be necessary to satisfy the conditions in paragraph (c) of Exhibit B of the
Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) upon reasonable notice, participating in a
reasonable number of lender presentations, meetings, conference calls,

 



44

    

 road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, in
each case, in connection with the Debt Financing at reasonable times and
locations to be mutually agreed, including direct contact between appropriate
members of senior management of the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and
potential Debt Financing Sources, on the other hand, (iii) (x) assisting
Purchaser in its preparation of (A) any offering documents, private placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda, lender presentations, marketing
materials and similar documents, and (B) materials for rating agency
presentations and (y) assisting Purchaser in its preparation of any
Debt Financing Documents (including schedules and exhibits thereto and any
certificates required thereby), (iv) reasonably facilitating the corporate
actions necessary in connection with obtaining of guarantees and other actions
in connection with pledging of collateral in connection with the Debt
Financing and taking such corporate action as Purchaser may reasonably request
to authorize and/or permit the consummation of the Debt Financing ( _provided_
that (1) none of the Financing Documents, corporate actions or certificates
(including the solvency certificates referred to in (vi)(B) below) shall be
approved, executed and/or delivered except in connection with the Closing, (2)
the effectiveness thereof shall be conditioned upon, or become operative
after, the occurrence of the Closing and (3) no liability shall be imposed on
Seller, any of its subsidiaries, or any of their respective officers or
employees involved (other than in connection with the authorization letters
referred to in _clause_ _(vi)_ _(A)_ below)), (v) assisting with the release
of the guarantees and liens granted by the Acquired Companies and their
subsidiaries in connection with the Credit Facility, (vi) causing a chief
financial officer (or other officer with reasonably equivalent duties) of the
Acquired Companies to execute (A) customary "authorization" letters in
connection with bank information memoranda authorizing the distribution of
information with respect to the Seller and/or the Acquired Companies to
prospective Debt Financing Sources and identifying any portion of such
information that constitutes material, non-public information regarding the
Seller and/or Acquired Companies, their respective subsidiaries or their
respective securities and (B) a solvency certificate with respect to the
solvency on a consolidated basis as of the Closing Date, (vii) providing
Purchaser and/or the Debt Financing Sources at least five Business Days prior
to the Closing Date with all information and documentation regarding Seller,
the Acquired Companies and its and their subsidiaries reasonably required by
regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and
the requirements of 31 C.F.R. §1010.230 to the extent requested in writing
at least eight (8) Business Days prior to Closing, and (viii) ensuring that
the syndication efforts in respect of the Debt Financing benefit from the
existing lending relationships of the Seller and/or the Acquired Companies.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall
require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with
the business or operations of Seller and its subsidiaries and (y) none of
Seller or any of its subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or
other fee or incur any other liability or obligation in connection with the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or any Alternative
Financing) or be required to take any action that would subject it to actual
or potential liability, to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment
or other similar fee or make any other payment or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the foregoing
except, in each case, (i) prior to the Closing, in connection with the
authorization letters referred to in _clause_ _(vi)_ _(A)_ above and (ii) in
the case of the Acquired Companies, for such actions that would be effective
from and after (and only from and after) the Closing. For the avoidance of
doubt, none of Seller or its subsidiaries or their respective officers,
directors (with respect to any subsidiary of Seller) or employees shall
be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with

 



45

    

 respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment
(or any Alternative Financing) that is not contingent upon the Closing or that
would be effective prior to the Closing and no directors of Seller shall be
required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the
Debt Financing (in each case, other than in connection with the authorization
letters referred to in _clause _ _(vi)_ _(A)_ above).

(c) Purchaser (i) shall promptly, upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including (A) reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket outside attorneys fees and (B) reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of Sellers accounting firms
engaged to assist in connection with the Financing, including performing
additional requested procedures, reviewing any offering documents,
participating in any meetings and providing any comfort letters) to the extent
incurred by Seller, any of its subsidiaries or their respective directors,
officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents,
investment bankers and other representatives in connection with the
cooperation of Seller and its subsidiaries contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
5.6_ and (ii) shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its subsidiaries

legal counsel, agents, investment bankers and other representatives from and
against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of the Debt Financing and the performance of their respective
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ (including any action taken in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_) and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information provided by Seller, the Acquired
Companies and its and their subsidiaries), except to the extent such losses
arise out of or result from the gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct,
bad faith or material breach of this Agreement by Seller, the Acquired
Companies, its or their subsidiaries and/or any of its respective directors,
officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents,
investment bankers and other representatives.

(d) Seller hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Acquired Companies
by Purchaser in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that Purchaser
shall ensure that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended,
or that is not reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the Acquired Companies
or the Acquired Companies reputation or goodwill.

Section 5.7 _Resignations_. Provided the resignation requests from Purchaser
do not require Seller to breach any Contract or violate Law, Seller shall
have delivered to Purchaser resignations effective as of the Closing Date of
each manager, director and officer of each Acquired Company who will not be
continuing as an employee of the Acquired Business following Closing to the
extent such resignations are requested by Purchaser 10 Business Days prior to
the Closing Date. If and to the extent that any resignation required to be
obtained pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ cannot be obtained from or
effected with respect to any manager, director or officer of any Acquired
Company prior to the Closing (including as a result of requirements under
applicable Law), Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective
subsidiaries to, cooperate with and assist each other in obtaining such
resignation as soon as practicable after the Closing.

 

Section 5.8 _Termination of Intercompany Agreements_. _Schedule 5.8_ of the
Disclosure Letter, sets forth certain Related Party Contracts and
arrangements, commitments, receivables, payables, claims, demands, rights,
promissory notes, loans or advances and Contracts to which an Acquired
Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than an
Acquired Company), on the other hand are a party (collectively, "
_Terminating Intercompany Agreements_ "). Effective on or prior to

 



46

    

 the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, effective upon
the Closing, execute and deliver such releases, termination agreements and
discharges as are necessary to terminate, eliminate and release, as
applicable (by way of capital contribution, cash settlement or as otherwise
determined by Seller in its sole discretion), all Terminating Intercompany
Agreements, without any continuing Liability or obligation on the part of any
Acquired Company, on the one hand, or Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) to fully and finally waive and release (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law), effective as of the Closing Date, any
claims, causes of action, losses, Liabilities or other rights arising under
any Terminating Intercompany Agreement (including such claims, causes of
action, losses, Liabilities or other rights that may arise as a result of the
termination of such Terminating Intercompany Agreement) that it may have
against any Acquired Company, on the one hand, or Seller or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, thereunder. For the avoidance of
doubt, intercompany accounts between and among the Acquired Companies, shall
not be affected by this provision.

Section 5.9 _Shared Contracts; Replacement of Seller Guarantees_.

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the Acquired Companies are parties to certain
Contracts that relate in part to both (i) the operations or conduct of the
Seller-Retained Business and (ii) the operations or conduct of the Acquired
Business, which Contracts are set forth in _Schedule 5.9(a)_ of
the Disclosure Letter (collectively, the " _Shared Contracts_ "). Following
the date hereof, Seller, the Acquired Companies, Purchaser and their
respective Affiliates shall cooperate with each other and with the applicable
third parties and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts prior
to the Closing (A) to cause the Shared Contracts to be apportioned (including
by obtaining the consent of such counterparty to enter into a new contract or
amendment, or splitting, mirroring or assigning in relevant part such Shared
Contract), effective as of the Closing, between the Acquired Companies and
Seller, pursuant to which Seller or one of its subsidiaries or Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Companies) will assume all of the rights and
obligations under such Shared Contract that relate to the Seller-Retained
Business, on the one hand, and the Acquired Companies will assume all of the
rights and obligations under such Shared Contract that relate to the Acquired
Business, on the other hand; and (B) in the case of Seller, to cause the
applicable counterparty to release the Acquired Companies, as applicable, from
the obligations of Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Acquired
Companies) and the Seller-Retained Business arising after the Closing Date
under the portion of the Shared Contract apportioned to Seller, its Affiliates
(excluding the Acquired Companies) or the Seller-Retained Business and, in the
case of the Acquired Companies to cause the applicable counterparty to
release Seller, its Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Companies) and the
Seller-Retained Business from the obligations of the Acquired Companies
arising after the Closing Date under the portion of the Shared Contract
apportioned to the Acquired Companies.

(b) From and after the Closing, (i) Purchaser shall not, and shall direct the
Acquired Companies not to, extend the term or otherwise amend the terms of any
Shared Contract in a manner that would adversely affect any member of Seller
or the Seller-Retained Business without Sellers prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
and (ii) Seller and the Seller-Retained Business shall not extend the term or
otherwise amend the terms of any Shared Contract in a manner that would
adversely affect Purchaser or the Acquired Companies without Purchasers
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



47

    

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that Seller and its Affiliates have entered
into various arrangements in which guarantees, letters of credit, bonds or
similar arrangements were issued by Seller or its Affiliates to support
liabilities and obligations of the Acquired Companies. The arrangements
entered into by Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies)
referred to in the foregoing clauses sentence are set forth in _Schedule
5.9(c)_ of the Disclosure Letter and are hereinafter referred to as the "
_Seller Guarantees_." Purchaser agrees that it shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange for itself or one of its Affiliates to be
substituted as the primary obligor thereon as of the Closing through a
novation, an assumption, accession, acknowledgement or similar agreement with
the beneficiary of the applicable Seller Guarantee, and, irrespective of
whether such replacement arrangements are entered into, Seller may terminate,
if terminable, or not renew such arrangement that is the subject of such
guarantee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Seller acknowledges that Purchaser shall not incur any costs,
expenses or Liabilities or be obligated to take any action whatsoever in
connection with obtaining such novation, an assumption, accession,
acknowledgement or similar agreement, other than to offer ASP Navigate
Holdings, Inc. as the replacement guarantor, and Seller agrees to reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser in such efforts.

 

Section 5.10 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and other Business Relations_.
Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and its Representatives shall not initiate,
solicit, maintain contact or otherwise communicate with, or cause to be
initiated, solicited or communicated with, any employee, supplier, landlord,
vendor, distributor or customer of any of the Acquired Companies in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of Seller; provided that Purchaser may contact any supplier,
distributor or customer (i) with which it has an existing commercial

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director
and officer of the Acquired Companies or any of its subsidiaries (in each
case, when acting in such capacity) (the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_"),
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or awards paid in
settlement incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative and whether formal or informal, arising out of, relating to or
in connection with matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing
(including the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of any
Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries or was serving at the request of
an Acquired Company or such subsidiary as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another Person (including serving at the request of an Acquired
Company or any such subsidiary with respect to any employee benefit plan), or
for or any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to the
Closing), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, to
the fullest extent that the Acquired Company would have been permitted under
Delaware Law and its Organizational Documents in effect on the date of this
Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Purchaser shall advance expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of
any proceeding, including any expenses incurred in enforcing such Persons
rights under this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_, regardless of whether indemnification
with respect to or advancement of such expenses is authorized under
such Acquired Companys Organizational

 



48

    

 Documents of any Acquired Company or its subsidiary; _provided_ that the
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_). In the event of any
such proceeding (x) neither Purchaser nor, following the Closing, any Acquired
Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in
any proceeding in which indemnification could be sought by such DandO
Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such DandO Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such proceeding or such DandO Indemnified Party
otherwise consents, and (y) Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to
reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter. In the event
any proceeding is brought against any DandO Indemnified Party and in which
indemnification could be sought by such DandO Indemnified Party under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.11_, (i) the Acquired Companies shall have the right to
control the defense thereof after the Closing (it being understood that, by
electing to control the defense thereof, the relevant Acquired Companies will
be deemed to have waived any right to object to the DandO Indemnified Partys
entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto), (ii) each DandO
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether
or not the Acquired Company shall elect to control the defense of any such
proceeding, (iii) Purchaser shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any
counsel retained by an DandO Indemnified Party promptly after statements
therefor are received, whether or not Purchaser shall elect to control the
defense of any such proceeding, and (iv) no DandO Indemnified Party shall be
liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior express written
consent.

 

(b) Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liability for acts or omissions occurring on or
prior to the Closing Date now existing in favor of the directors, officers or
managers of each Acquired Company (acting in such capacities) (the " _D andO
Indemnified Parties_"), as provided in the relevant Acquired Companys
Organizational Documents or the comparable governing instruments of any of its
subsidiaries, as in effect as of the date hereof, shall survive the Closing
Date and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing
Date and that such Organization Documents shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Closing in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

(c) If Purchaser or any Acquired Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser or such Acquired Company shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_.

(d) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ are, following the Closing,
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
DandO Indemnified Parties and their heirs and Representatives.

 



49

    

(e) The rights of the DandO Indemnified Parties under this  _Section_ __ _
5.11_ shall be in addition to any rights such DandO Indemnified Parties may have
under any applicable Contracts or Laws. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to any Acquired Company or its officers, directors
and employees, it being understood that the indemnification provided for in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such
claims under any such policies.

 

Section 5.12 _Delivery of Carve-Out Audited Financials_. Prior to the Closing
and promptly after they become available, Seller shall, or shall cause the
Acquired Companies to, deliver to Purchaser the Carve-Out Audited Financials.
Seller and the Company covenant that the information provided in the Carve-Out
Audited Financials, and the methodologies, policies, principles and practices
followed to prepare the Carve-Out Audited Financials, shall be consistent
and substantially the same as the information provided in the Annual
Financial Statements delivered to, and reviewed by, Purchaser prior to the
date of this Agreement. The assets, liabilities and results of operations
reflected in the Carve-Out Audited Financials shall not differ from those in
such Annual Financial Statements in any manner that would be material to the
Acquired Business, taken as a whole. Purchaser acknowledges that the
Annual Financial Statements reflect the fact that the Acquired Business has
not operated as a separate "stand alone" entity within Seller and may not
reflect all carve-out adjustments (including tax-related carve-out
adjustments) to account for the fact that the Acquired Business has not been
operated as a "stand alone" entity and may not necessarily be indicative of
the conditions that would have existed or the results of operations that would
have been achieved if the Acquired Business had been operated as a standalone
entity.

 

Section 5.13 _Title Affidavits_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, or shall
cause the Acquired Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver to Purchasers title insurer, in connection with Purchasers pursuit
of the issuance of any policy of title insurance for any fee-owned property
(at Purchasers sole cost and expense), customary owners affidavits, in a
form reasonably acceptable to Seller, Purchaser and the applicable title
insurer

 

Section 5.14 _Restriction on Transfer of Equipment; Continuation of Pricing
Arrangement_. Prior to Closing, Seller and its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) shall (i) not, either directly or indirectly, transfer, or
cause to be transferred, any equipment that is an Acquired Business Asset used
to provide services by the Acquired Business to the Seller-Retained Business
under that certain pricing agreement, dated as July 1, 2019 (the " _Brainin
Pricing Agreement_ "), by and between Brainin-Advance Industries LLC and
Itron, Inc (the " _East Providence Equipment_ ") from any facility operated
by the Acquired Business (including the facility of the Acquired Business
located in East Providence, Rhode Island (the " _East Providence Facility_ "))
to any facility operated by the Seller Retained Business, without the
Purchasers prior written consent, and (ii) cause the applicable Acquired
Company and the applicable Seller-Retained Subsidiary to enter into a supply
agreement for the period of three (3) years from the Closing Date the ("
_East Providence Supply Agreement Term_ "). Such supply agreement will provide
for the supply of certain services and products contemplated by the Brainin
Pricing Agreement on the same pricing and other economic terms set forth
therein for such services as of the date hereof; provided that, for each year
during the East Providence Supply Agreement Term, Seller shall be entitled to
a 3% discount from Purchaser off such pricing, commencing immediately on the
first day of each year during the East Providence Supply Agreement Term. Upon
the conclusion of the East Providence Supply Agreement Term, Seller or any of
its Affiliates shall have the option to purchase or otherwise acquire
from Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof, the right, title and interest in and
to the East Providence Equipment for a purchase price in an amount equal to $1
(One Dollar) (the

 



50

    

 " _Equipment Buyout Option_ "); provided that in the event Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates sells or otherwise disposes of the East Providence Facility
during the East Providence Supply Agreement Term, Seller shall have the right
to exercise the Equipment Buyout Option immediately, with the completion of
such purchase to occur simultaneously with the completion of such disposition,
and Purchaser shall provide Seller with reasonable advance notice to permit
the Seller to exercise such Equipment Buyout Option as contemplated hereby.
During the East Providence Supply Agreement Term, Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) shall not, either directly or indirectly,
transfer, or cause to be transferred, the East Providence Equipment from the
East Providence Facility.

period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, without the prior written
consent of Seller, disclose to any third party (other than each other and
their respective Representatives) any non-public, proprietary and confidential
information relating to Seller and its subsidiaries (other than the Acquired
Companies) or the Seller-Retained Business (the " _Seller Proprietary
Information_ ", and, together with the Acquired Company Proprietary
Information, the " _Proprietary Information_ "). Purchaser shall hold,
and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to hold, in confidence all
documents and information furnished to it by or on behalf of the other Parties
hereto in connection with the Transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the
terms of that certain confidentiality letter agreement entered into between
Purchaser and Seller, dated March 6, 2020 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"), which shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by
the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement, Seller consents to the
disclosure of the Proprietary Information (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) to prospective Debt Financing Sources, subject to entry by such
Debt Financing Source into (i) a joinder to the Confidentiality Agreement,
whereby such prospective Debt Financing Source becomes bound as a party
thereto, or (ii) customary confidentiality arrangements no less restrictive
than the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) The obligations of each Party hereto (a " _Receiving Party_ ") set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ shall not apply to (i) any information that
becomes available to the general public prior to, on or after the Closing Date
(other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party or any of its
Representatives in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or the
Confidentiality Agreement), (ii) any information that becomes available to the
Receiving Party or any of its Representatives after the Closing Date on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the other Party hereto (the

 



51

    

 " _Disclosing Party_ ") or its Representatives; _provided_ that such source
was not, to the knowledge of the Receiving Party, prohibited from disclosing
such information by a legal, contractual, fiduciary or other obligation,
(iii) except as provided in clause (vi) below, any disclosure requested or
required by applicable Law or any Governmental Entity, including any
applicable Tax Laws, securities Laws or securities exchange or listing
regulations or requirements; _provided_ that, to the extent such disclosure is
requested or required in connection with an Order, the Receiving Party shall,
to the extent reasonably practicable and legally permissible, promptly notify
the Disclosing Party of such disclosure under this clause (iii) prior to
making such disclosure with reasonably sufficient time, where reasonably
practicable, to allow the Disclosing Party to seek protective measures for
such Proprietary Information (and the Receiving Party and its Representatives
shall cooperate with the Disclosing Party in seeking such protection, at the
Disclosing Partys sole cost and expense), (iv) any Order in connection
with the enforcement of a Partys rights or remedies under this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents solely to the extent necessary for any filings
with a Governmental Entity ( _provided_ that to the extent possible, the
applicable Party shall request that such Governmental Entity treat such
Proprietary Information as confidential and non-public), (v) any disclosure or
use of Proprietary Information in connection with the preparation
of financial statements, (vi) in connection with and to the extent necessary
for a Party or any of its Representatives to prepare or file Tax Returns or
other Tax filings, (vii) any disclosure or use of Proprietary Information that
is necessary for a Party to perform or satisfy any of its obligations under
this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or (viii) any
information that is independently developed by the Receiving Party or its
Representatives without reference to or use of any Proprietary Information of
the Disclosing Party.

(d) Following the Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to enforce its rights under each Seller Confidentiality Agreement to the
fullest extent on behalf of the Company. As used herein, " _Seller
Confidentiality Agreement_ " means each confidentiality or similar agreement
(other than the Confidentiality Agreement) entered into by Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than an Acquired Company) in connection with the
consideration of a possible sale of any Acquired Company or the Acquired
Business. 

Section 6.2 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint press release and thereafter
Seller and Purchaser shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press
releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as may be required by Law
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the
request of any Governmental Entity (or, in the case of Seller by the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors of Seller as reasonably determined by the
Board of Directors of Seller), in each case, as determined in the good faith
judgment of the Party proposing to make such release (in which case, such
Party shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other
public announcement without prior consultation with the other Party).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and its Affiliates may provide
ordinary course communications regarding this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby to existing or prospective general and limited partners,
equity holders, members, managers and investors of any Affiliates of such
Person, in each case, who are subject to customary confidentiality
restrictions.

Section 6.3 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Indemnification_. Without duplication of any amounts taken into
account in the final determination of Closing Indebtedness or Net Working
Capital, the Seller shall be liable for and to indemnify and hold Purchaser
and the Acquired Companies harmless from and against any and all Losses in
respect of (i) all Taxes of the Acquired Companies (A) for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, and (B) for the portion of any Straddle Period (as defined below)
ending on the Closing Date (determined as provided in Section 6.3(b)); (ii)
all Taxes attributable to any inclusion by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including any of the Acquired Companies) under Section 951 or Section 951A of
the Code at the end of the taxable year of an Acquired Company that includes
the Closing Date allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period as determined under
Section 6.3(b); (iii) all Taxes imposed on any Acquired Company by reason of
having been a member of a combined, consolidated, unitary or similar group
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any predecessor or
successor thereof or any analogous or similar provision under state, local or
foreign Law); (iv) all Transfer Taxes incurred solely as a result of the
Reorganization; and (v) any Tax on indirect transfers of equity interests in
China resident enterprises as a result of the application of Public Notice 7
and related guidance or authority published by the State Administration
of Taxation of the Peoples Republic of China required to be paid by the
Seller or its Affiliate (including the Acquired Companies) arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _PRC Transaction Tax_ ").
The obligations of Seller contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ shall
survive until the close of business on the 30th day following the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations.

 

(b) _Straddle Period_. In any case in which a Tax is assessed with respect to
a Straddle Period, the Taxes or refunds, if any, attributable to a Straddle
Period shall be allocated (i) to the Seller for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and
(ii) to each such Acquired Company for the Post-Closing Tax Period. Real,
personal and intangible property Taxes and any other similar Taxes levied on
a per diem basis for a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period on a daily pro-rata basis.
Any allocation of income or deduction required to determine any Taxes not
described in the previous sentence that are attributable to a Straddle Period
shall be made by means of a closing of the books and records of the Acquired
Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date (assuming that the
Closing occurs after the close of business on the Closing Date), provided that
exemption, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing
Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) any items attributable to actions not in the ordinary
course of business and not contemplated by this Agreement taken by Purchaser
or the Acquired Companies on the Closing Date and after the Closing shall not
be allocated to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) all tax deductions
attributable to the Acquired Companies Transaction Expenses shall be allocated
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Law. For purposes of any amount required to be included under Section 951 or
Section 951A of the Code with respect to any Straddle Period of a
non-U.S. subsidiary, the taxable year of the relevant non-U.S. subsidiary
giving rise to the income required to be included under Section 951 or Section
951A of the Code shall be deemed to close in the same manner as described in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_ and the amount of income required to be included
under Section 951 or Section 951A of the Code to be allocated to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined by means of a closing of the books and
records as

 



53

    

 of the close of business on the Closing Date, provided, however, that any
foreign taxes allowed as a credit or as otherwise reducing any amount required
to be included under Section 951 or Section 951A of the Code shall be ratably
allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
based upon the allocation of the amount of local taxable income of the
relevant non-U.S. subsidiary giving rise such Section 951 or Section 951A
inclusion between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
which shall be allocated based upon the closing of the books and records as
of the close of business on the Closing Date in the same manner as described
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in computing
the Section 951 and Section 951A amounts referred to in the previous
sentence, any restructuring actions (for the avoidance of doubt, other than
financing transactions) taken with respect to the Acquired Companies outside
of the ordinary course of business and after Closing that materially impair
Purchaser and/or the Acquired Companies ability to utilize the deduction
specified in Section 250 of the Code or any foreign tax credits shall be
disregarded.

 

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes described
in  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)(iv)_) shall be borne by Purchaser. All Transfer
Taxes incurred in connection with the Reorganization shall be borne by the
Seller. The Party required by applicable Law to file a Tax Return with respect
to such Transfer Taxes shall do so within the time period prescribed by
applicable Law, and the Parties shall reasonably cooperate with respect to
such filing. Without duplication of any indemnification obligations set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, each Seller hereby agrees to indemnify the
Purchaser for any and all Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the
Reorganization.

 

(d) _Preparation of Tax Returns_. Seller shall prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, when due all Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any income
Tax Return of a Parent Group. All such Tax Returns (other than Tax Returns of
a Parent Group), to the extent relating to the Acquired Companies, should be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice unless otherwise required
by applicable Law. Purchaser shall be responsible for all other Tax Returns of
the Acquired Companies. The Parent Groups shall include the income of the
Acquired Companies (including any deferred intercompany items described in
Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-13 and any excess loss accounts taken into income under
Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-19) for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods in the Consolidated
Returns of Parent Groups for all periods through the close of the Closing Date
and shall pay any Taxes attributable to such income. The income of the
Acquired Companies for the final Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined
based on a closing of the books as of the close of the Closing Date, excluding
items attributable to actions not in the ordinary course of business and not
contemplated by this Agreement taken by Purchaser or Acquired Companies on the
Closing Date and after the Closing.

 

(e) _Tax Basis_.

 

(i) No later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing, the Seller
shall deliver a schedule of the Final Tax Basis Amount for the Acquired
Companies setting forth the Sellers good faith and reasonably detailed
calculations demonstrating each component thereof. Purchaser may provide
comments on the Final Tax Basis Amount. The Seller shall in good faith
consider the comments, if any, of Purchaser on the Final Tax Basis Amount, and
shall revise the Final Tax Basis Amount to reflect any such comments that the
Seller has determined to accept. If the Parties are unable to reach an
agreement with respect to any of Purchasers comments at least thirty (30)
days following Sellers delivery of such schedule, such dispute shall be
resolved following the Closing pursuant to Section 1.5(d).

 



54

    

(ii) If the Tax Basis Amount exceeds the Final Tax Basis Amount, then
the Seller shall, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days following the filing the final determination of such amount
under Section 6.3(e)(i), pay or cause to be paid to the Purchaser, in cash, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated in
writing by the Buyer, the Tax Basis Adjustment Amount.

 

(iii) _Principles of calculations_. The Final Tax Basis Amount and Tax Basis
Adjustment Amount shall be determined by adjusting the Tax Basis Amount
solely to reflect the U.S. federal income tax impact of the actions taken by
Seller prior to Closing (or with retroactive tax effect prior to Closing) in
connection with the Reorganization Plan (for the avoidance of doubt,
including Tax elections made by Seller with respect thereto), and not any
transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business and not primarily
related to Taxes or Tax planning.

 

(f) _Cooperation in Tax Matters_.

 

(i) After the Closing Date, the Parties hereto shall cooperate fully and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished to one another, upon reasonable request, as
promptly as practicable, such documentation, information and cooperation
relating to the Acquired Companies as is reasonably necessary for the filing
of all Tax Returns, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the making
of any voluntary disclosures, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing
Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim or proceeding relating
to any Tax Return or Taxes. Such cooperation shall include access to books,
records and information, making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder and executing powers of attorney. To the extent requested
by Seller, after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and to the extent relevant,
shall cause any Acquired Company, to promptly provide its consent and
signature of the required person(s) in order to a secure a retroactive entity
classification election on IRS Form 8832 (or successor form) with respect to
any Seller-Retained Subsidiary.

(ii) Without the prior written consent of Seller (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Purchaser shall not, and
shall not cause or permit its Affiliates (including, following Closing, the
Acquired Companies) to, (x) take any action on the Closing Date that is
outside the ordinary course of business, (y) make or change any Tax election,
amend any Tax Return, or take any other action relating to Taxes, if, in each
case, such action could have the effect of increasing the Tax liability of
Seller in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (z) voluntarily approach
any Governmental Entity regarding Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



55

    

(g) _Tax Audits_. Seller shall represent the Parent Group in any action,
suit, investigation or audit with respect to Taxes (a " _Tax Claim_ ") of the
Parent Group. Purchaser shall represent the Acquired Companies in a Tax Claim
of any Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, provided that, (i)
Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller upon receipt of a notification of any
Tax Claim, and to the extent Seller does not participate in such
representation, Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably informed of the
progress of any such Tax Claim that is subject to indemnification pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, (ii) Seller may at its own expense participate in the
representation of any such Tax Claim, and (iii) Purchaser shall consult in
good faith with Seller before taking any action with respect to the conduct of
such Tax Claim and shall not effect any settlement or compromise of such Tax
Claim without prior consent of the Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed). In connection with any Tax Claim for which Seller is
responsible under this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, at Sellers request, Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller to
mitigate any Losses, to the extent the out-of-pocket costs are borne by Seller
and such actions would not be materially adverse to Purchaser.

(h) _Refunds_. Seller shall be entitled to receive from the Purchaser all
refunds (or credits in lieu of refunds), if any, including any interest paid
thereon, that are received by any Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies
following the Closing and that are attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
other than refunds accounted for in the Purchase Price or resulting from any
carry-back of Post-Closing Losses. Purchaser shall pay any such refund (or the
amount of any such credit), net of any Taxes and expenses incurred in
connection with the receipt thereof, to the Seller within fifteen (15) days
after Purchaser or the applicable Acquired Company receives such refund (or
credit in lieu of a refund). The parties hereto shall execute all documents,
take reasonable additional actions and otherwise reasonably cooperate as may
be necessary to obtain the refunds (or credits in lieu of a refund)
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(h)_.

 

(i) _PRC Transaction Tax_. Purchaser shall not (i) withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any PRC
Transaction Tax unless Purchaser is notified in writing that it is required to
do so by the appropriate Taxing Authority or Purchaser receives an opinion of
internationally recognized tax counsel that such withholding will be required
or (ii) voluntarily approach any Taxing Authority regarding the PRC
Transaction Tax without prior consent of the Seller (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

 

Section 6.4 _Wrong Pockets_.

 

(a) To the extent that right, title or interest to any asset, property or
right held by Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates (acting in
good faith) is determined to be or is otherwise identified as a Seller-
Retained Asset on or after the Closing Date, (i) such asset, property or right
shall from Closing have been and be held in trust by Purchaser for
the benefit of and on behalf of Seller; and (ii) Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its applicable subsidiaries or Affiliates to, assign, convey or as
promptly as practicable transfer any such asset, property or right to Seller
(or an Affiliate thereof as Seller may specify (without additional
consideration or cost being paid or incurred by Seller)), in each case,
pursuant to an instrument of transfer reasonably satisfactory to Seller.
Purchaser and Seller shall each bear 50% of all out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the transfer contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
6.4(a)_.

 



56

    

(b) To the extent that right, title or interest to any asset, property
or right held by Seller or any of its retained subsidiaries or Affiliates
(acting in good faith) is determined to be or is otherwise identified as an
Acquired Business Asset on or after the Closing Date, (i) such asset, property
or right shall from Closing have been and be held in trust by Seller for the
benefit of and on behalf of Purchaser and the Acquired Companies and (ii)
Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable subsidiaries or Affiliates to,
assign, convey or as promptly as practicable transfer any such asset,
property or right to Purchaser or an Acquired Company (or an Affiliate thereof
as Purchaser may specify (without additional consideration or cost being paid
or incurred by Purchaser or the Acquired Companies)), in each case, pursuant
to an instrument of transfer reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. Purchaser
and Seller shall each bear 50% of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the transfer contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or any Transaction
Documents, following the Closing, (i) if any payments due with respect to the
Acquired Business that should have been sent to Purchaser or any of the
Acquired Companies are paid to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than
the Acquired Companies), Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate
to, promptly remit by wire or draft such payment to an account designated in
writing by Purchaser (including promptly forwarding corresponding invoices or
similar documentation to Purchaser or its designee) and (ii) if any payments
due with respect to the Seller-Retained Business and should have been sent to
Seller or any of its Affiliates are paid to Purchaser, the Acquired
Companies or their Affiliates, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, promptly remit by wire or draft such payment to an account designated in
writing by Seller.

 

Section 6.5 _Seller Trademarks; Company Name_.

 

(a) Purchaser is not obtaining pursuant to this Agreement or any Transaction
Document any rights with respect to any Seller-Retained Trademarks, except
for the limited license during the Phase-Out Period as expressly set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ or as otherwise expressly set forth herein
or therein. Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing, Purchaser (i) will
cause each Acquired Companys Organizational Documents to be amended to change
such Acquired Companys name such that it does not contain any Seller-
Retained Trademark, and (ii) will, or will cause the Acquired Companies to,
execute and deliver to the applicable Governmental Entity all necessary
documentation and materials to effectuate such name change, and prosecute such
name change diligently until completion. Purchaser will and will cause the
Acquired Companies to cease to apply or use the Seller-Retained Trademarks for
or on any new Company Offerings or any products, inventory, signage, websites,
advertisements, marketing brochures, purchase orders, invoices, sales orders,
labels, letterhead, business cards, employee and customer communications,
packaging, shipping documents and other materials or content in any media ("
_Branded Materials_ "), in each case, that are created after the Closing
Date.

(b) During the twelve (12) months (or forty-five (45) days for any online or
digital materials following the Closing) (the " _Phase-Out Period_"), Seller
hereby grants to Purchaser and each Acquired Company a royalty-free, non-
sublicensable (except to suppliers, manufacturers and other contractors
materially consistent with past practice), non-transferable, and non-
exclusive license to use the Seller-Retained Trademarks on Branded Materials
in existence as of the Closing Date in a manner materially consistent with
past practice and customary "phase-out use". All use of the Seller-Retained
Trademarks by the Acquired Companies and all associated goodwill will inure to
the sole benefit of Seller. For clarity, Purchaser shall be entitled to
use the Seller-Retained Trademarks (i) in historical documents, contracts or
records or any similar materials maintained for record-keeping purposes, (ii)
in a neutral, non-trademark manner to describe the history of the Acquired
Companies or the Acquired Business and (iii) as required by contractual
obligations in effect as of the Closing or applicable Law.

 



57

    

Section 6.6 _Inventions_. Effective as of the Closing Date:

(a) Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (as of the Closing Date)
(for the avoidance of doubt, excluding the Acquired Companies, the " _Seller
Covenant Parties_ "), hereby covenants to Purchaser that none of the Seller
Covenant Parties shall bring any proceeding against Purchaser or
its Affiliates (as of the Closing) anywhere in the world that alleges that
the current and future operation of the Acquired Companies or the Acquired
Business infringes any Intellectual Property other than Trademarks (the "
_Inventions_ ") that, in each case, is (i) owned by the Seller Covenant
Parties as of the Closing Date and (ii) used in the Acquired Business as of
the Closing Date or at any time during the twelve (12) month period prior to
the Closing Date.

 

(b) Purchaser, on behalf of itself and the Acquired Companies (the "
_Purchaser Covenant Parties_ ") hereby covenants to the Seller Covenant
Parties that none of the Purchaser Covenant Parties shall bring any proceeding
against any of the Seller Covenant Parties anywhere in the world that alleges
that the current and future operation of Seller-Retained Business infringes
any Inventions that are (x) owned by the Acquired Companies as of the Closing
Date and (y) used in the Seller-Retained Business as of the Closing Date or at
any time during the twelve (12) month period prior to the Closing Date.

(c) The covenants in _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_ and _(b)_ extend to the
contractors, service providers, distributors, resellers and end-users of the
applicable Seller Covenant Parties or the Purchaser Covenant Parties, as
applicable, with respect to the covered businesses of the Seller Covenant
Parties or the Purchaser Covenant Parties, as applicable, but not with respect
to other products or services of such third parties.

 

(d) The Parties intend and agree that, for purposes of Section 365(n) of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code (and any amendment thereto) and any equivalent Law in
any foreign jurisdiction, each of the above covenants will be treated as a
license to intellectual property (as defined in Section 101(35A) of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code).

 

(e) The above covenants are intended to run with the Inventions subject to
such covenant. The Seller Covenant Parties and Purchaser Covenant Parties may
and must transfer its covenant granted herein, in whole or in part, to the
successor or acquirer of any Inventions subject thereto, and such successor or
acquirer shall be deemed to assume its obligations by operation of Law. Each
Seller Covenant Party and Purchaser Covenant Party may transfer the covenant
granted thereto in whole or in part, in connection with the sale of any
business to which the covenant relates (or in a merger, reorganization or
equity sale of any entity owning same), provided that the covenant will not
extend to any acquirers other businesses.

Section 6.7  _Records and Documents_.

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.7(c)_, following the Closing until the seven
(7) year anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall maintain all books
and records of the Acquired Business prior to the Closing in the manner such
books and records are maintained immediately prior to the Closing Date. After
the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired

 



58

    

 Companies to, provide Seller and its Representatives reasonable access,
consistent with applicable Law, upon reasonable advance written request (email
being sufficient), during normal business hours, to (i) the officers and
employees of the Acquired Companies and (ii) the books and records of the
Acquired Companies (other than any Excluded Books and Records that were not in
the possession of any Acquired Company as of the Closing), but, in each case,
only with respect to the periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing
Date and for a reasonable business or commercial purpose, and Seller and its
Representatives shall have the right to make copies of such books and records
at its sole cost. If so requested by either Seller or Purchaser, the other
Party shall enter into a customary joint defense agreement with Seller or
Purchaser with respect to any information to be provided to such Party
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
such investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of Purchaser or the
Acquired Companies or otherwise result in any significant interference with
the discharge by such officers, employees and other authorized Representatives
of their normal duties in the ordinary course and, subject to _Section_ __ _
6.11_, shall not include any environmental sampling or testing of any kind.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.7(c)_, following the Closing until the seven
(7) year anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries and Affiliates to, provide Purchaser, Purchasers Affiliates, the
Acquired Companies and their respective representatives with reasonable
access, consistent with applicable Law, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance written notice (e-mail to suffice), and in a manner so as
not to unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of Seller,
to the Excluded Books and Records (i) for purposes of performing Purchasers
and the Companys obligations hereunder, (ii) in connection with any Action to
which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including any Acquired Company) are
parties with respect to matters that relate to the Acquired Companies or the
conduct of their business but, in each case, excluding any Actions or other
claims or disputes between Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Purchaser, any Acquired Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, or (iii) in connection with the requirements of
any Law applicable to the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates with respect to matters that relate to the Acquired Companies or
the conduct of their business. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by
Purchaser, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of their Affiliates to,
for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or
otherwise dispose of any of the Excluded Books and Records without first
giving reasonable prior written notice to Purchaser and the Company
and offering to surrender to Purchaser and the Company such Excluded Books
and Records or any portion thereof which any Seller or any Affiliate of any
Seller may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 6.7(b)_, Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies, on the
one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, may prevent or withhold from the other
party and such other partys representatives any access, document
or information to the extent that the party that is otherwise required to
provide such access, document or information pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.7(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.7(b)_, as applicable (the " _Accessed Party_ "),
determines, based on the advice of counsel, that (x) it is prohibited from
disclosing such document or information pursuant to applicable Law or the
terms of any Contract or confidentiality agreement with a third party;
provided that the Accessed Party shall be required to have first used
reasonable best efforts to have obtained consent of the relevant third party
or (y) such document or information is subject to the attorney-client or other
legal privilege, but only if permitting such access or making available such
document or information would jeopardize the protection of such privilege.

 



59

    

Section 6.8 _Non-Solicit; Non-Compete_.

(a) Without obtaining Purchasers prior written consent, for a period of one
(1) year after the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates (other than any
Acquired Company) will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment,
hire, or retain the services of, any person who is an employee of the
Acquired Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
preclude Seller from (i) engaging in, offering employment to and hiring as a
result of, general solicitations of employment by means of general
advertisements or through a professional recruiter who was not instructed to
target any employee of the Acquired Companies, or (ii) offering employment to,
and hiring, any former employee of the Acquired Companies that has not been an
employee of the Acquired Business for a period of six (6) months.

(b) Without obtaining Sellers prior written consent, for a period of one (1)
year after the Closing Date, Purchaser will not, and Purchaser will cause the
Acquired Companies not to, directly or indirectly solicit for employment, hire
or retain services of, any person who is an employee of Seller or its
subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude
Purchaser from (i) engaging in, offering employment to and hiring as a result
of, general solicitations of employment by means of general advertisements or
through a professional recruiter who was not instructed to target any
employee of Seller or its subsidiaries, or (ii) offering employment to, and
hiring, any former employee of Seller or its subsidiaries that has not been an
employee of Seller or its subsidiaries for a period of six (6) months.

(c) For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, Seller and
its Affiliates (other than any Acquired Company) shall not and shall cause
their respective subsidiaries not to, directly engage in the Acquired Business
as conducted as of the date of this Agreement in North America and any other
jurisdictions where the Acquired Companies operate on the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller, its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) and its subsidiaries shall not be prohibited from (i) continuing to
engage in the Seller-Retained Business or any other business (other than the
Acquired Business) that Seller or any of its subsidiaries engages in as of the
date of this Agreement; (ii) engaging in any modification, improvements or new
versions of existing products of the Seller-Retained Business; or (iii)
holding not more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding voting securities
of any publicly listed company.

 

(d) During the one (1) year period and the three (3) year period, as
applicable, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly
or indirectly, knowingly assist or encourage any other Person in carrying out
any activity that would be prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 6.8(a)_ and _Section_
__ _ 6.8(c)_, as applicable, if such activity were carried out by Seller or
any of its Affiliates, either directly or indirectly.

(e) During the one (1) year period, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies not to, directly or indirectly, knowingly assist or
encourage any other Person in carrying out any activity that would be
prohibited by  _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_, if such activity were carried out by
Purchaser or the Acquired Companies, either directly or indirectly.

Section 6.9 _Insurance_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement, except
(x) with respect to any pending claim that has been submitted by or on behalf
of the any Acquired Company prior to the Closing or (y) any incident, event,
or occurrence prior to the Closing for which any potential claim is permitted
to be made following the Closing under any insurance policy maintained by
Seller or its Affiliates for the benefit of any Acquired Company or any of
their respective assets (collectively, the " _Continuing Claims_ "), effective
at the time of the Closing, (i) the Acquired Companies shall cease to be
insured by any current and historical insurance policies or programs of Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) and (ii)
Purchaser shall become solely responsible for all insurance coverage
and related risk of loss with respect to the Acquired Companies and their
current or former directors, officers and employees. From and after the
Closing, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, amend,
modify, cancel, terminate or waive any insurance policy or related ancillary
agreement thereunder in any manner that limits, prevents or terminates
coverage for any Continuing Claims; _provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in the foregoing or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent or
restrict Seller from amending, modifying, cancelling, terminating or waiving
any insurance policy or related ancillary agreement thereunder with regards to
any period following the Closing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 6.9(a)_, to the extent that (i) any
insurance policies issued for the benefit of Seller or any of its
subsidiaries (the " _Seller_ __ _s Insurance Policies_ ") cover any loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense relating to the Acquired Companies and
relating to or arising out of occurrences on or prior to the Closing Date ("
_Pre-Closing Matters_") and (ii) Sellers Insurance Policies continue after
the Closing to permit claims to be made thereunder with respect to Pre-Closing
Matters, Seller shall, and cause its subsidiaries (including the Acquired
Companies) to, (A) from and after the date of this Agreement until the
Closing, report in the ordinary course of business to the applicable insurer
under any Sellers Insurance Policy any and all potential claims or losses
arising in connection with the operation of the business by any Acquired
Companies on or after the date hereof, and (B) following the Closing,
cooperate with Purchaser and its subsidiaries (including the Acquired
Companies) to submit claims with respect to Pre-Closing Matters on behalf of
Purchaser under the Sellers Insurance Policies;  _provided_ that Purchaser
shall not make any such claims if, and to the extent that, such claims are
covered by insurance policies held by Purchaser or its Affiliates. Subject to
the provisions of _Article VII_ , by making any claims under the Sellers
Insurance Policies, Purchaser agrees to reimburse, indemnify and hold Seller
and its subsidiaries harmless from all reasonable, documented and out-of-
pocket fees, costs and expenses (including retroactive or prospective premium
adjustments, deductibles, self-insured retentions, legal and administrative
costs, attorneys fees, overhead and costs of compliance under Sellers
Insurance Policies) actually incurred by Seller or its subsidiaries as a
result of such claims made under the Sellers Insurance Policies. Upon the
incurrence or accrual of any such liability, cost or expense relating to
claims made under the Sellers Insurance Policies with respect to Pre-Closing
Matters and upon receipt from Seller of a statement of the amount of
such liabilities, costs and expenses in reasonable detail, from time to time,
Purchaser shall make payment promptly to Seller or its Affiliates of the
amount indicated in such statement.

 



61

    

(c) Prior to Closing, Seller shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to
transfer and assign the Insurance Policies listed under _Section_ __ _
6.9(c)_ of the Disclosure Letter (the " _Acquired Insurance Policies_ ") to
Purchaser or its designee (including any of the Acquired Companies) to
the extent such Acquired Insurance Policies relate solely to the Acquired
Business; _provided_ that Seller and its subsidiaries shall not be required to
incur any cost, expense, degradation of insurance coverage, increase in
premiums or similar detriment in connection with any such proposed assignment
and (ii) subject to the foregoing proviso, provide Purchaser with access to
the applicable insurance carriers, including by executing any required
documentation or letter of authority allowing such access; provided that such
access shall be solely for purposes of assigning Purchaser or any of the
Acquired Subsidiaries to be effective at Closing.

 

Section 6.10 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For the 12 month period following the Closing Date but in no event later
than December 31, 2021 (the " _Benefit Continuation Period_ "), Purchaser
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to provide, to each Acquired Company
Employee who continues to be employed by an Acquired Company as of the Closing
Date (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), (i) a salary or wage that, in each
case, is no less favorable than the salary or wage that such Continuing
Employee was entitled to immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
employee benefits (excluding equity-based compensation, deferred compensation,
change-in-control, retention or transaction-related benefits, defined benefit
pension benefits and post-retirement welfare benefits) and fringe benefits
that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those employee
benefits (excluding perquisites, equity-based compensation, deferred
compensation, change-in-control, retention or transaction-related benefits,
defined benefit pension benefits and post-retirement welfare benefits) and
fringe benefits that such Continuing Employee was entitled to immediately
prior to the Closing Date; provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser or its designee may perform a market study with respect to employee
benefits and fringe benefits and may adjust the employee benefits and fringe
benefits provided to Continuing Employees in 2021 to market levels as
determined by such study. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
for the duration of the Benefit Continuation Period, Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates shall maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee,
severance or termination payments and other severance or termination benefits
that are no less favorable than the severance or termination payments and
other severance or termination benefits provided to such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, the terms and conditions of
employment for any Continuing Employee that is covered by a collective
bargaining agreement shall be in accordance with said collective bargaining
agreement.

(b) Purchaser shall ensure, or shall cause its Affiliates to ensure, that all
Continuing Employees who are employed as of the last day of the Companys
fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs receive annual bonuses for such
fiscal year at least equal to the full (non-prorated) annual bonus to which
such Continuing Employee is entitled under the terms of the Companys annual
bonus plan in which such Continuing Employee participates for the Companys
fiscal year that includes the Closing Date based on actual performance for
such fiscal year as reasonably determined by the Purchaser. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10(b)_, the terms and
conditions of employment for any Continuing Employee that is covered by a
collective bargaining agreement shall be in accordance with said collective
bargaining agreement.

 



62

    

(c) Effective as of the later of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the date on
which a new federal employee identification number is received with respect
to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan (provided, that, Purchaser will use commercially
reasonable efforts to receive a new federal employee identification number as
soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof), Purchaser shall,
or shall have caused one of its Affiliates to establish or maintain a defined
contribution savings plan and related trust intended to satisfy the
requirements of Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code (such defined
contribution savings plan or plans, the " _Purchaser_ _401_ _(k)_ _Plan_ ").
Purchaser shall undertake commercially reasonable efforts to establish,
maintain and administer the Purchaser 401(k) Plan so that it is qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, that it satisfies the requirements of
Section 401(k) of the Code and that the related trust thereunder is exempt
under Section 501(a) of the Code, and as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall undertake commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain a favorable determination from the IRS as to such
qualification if one is not then applicable to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan.
Purchaser shall undertake commercially reasonable efforts to provide that
each Continuing Employee may elect to rollover his or her full account balance
(including cash, notes (in the case of loans), or a combination thereof) in
the NN, Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_, the
terms and conditions of employment for any Continuing Employee that is covered
by a collective bargaining agreement shall be in accordance with said
collective bargaining agreement.

(d) To the extent that Purchaser modifies any coverage or benefit plan in
which Continuing Employees participate, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies and any subsidiaries thereof) shall
undertake commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive or cause to be waived
any pre-existing conditions, exclusions, limitations, actively-at-work
requirements, and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of
Purchaser or its Affiliates with respect to Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents, (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan
year in which the Closing Date occurs towards applicable deductibles and
annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Closing
Date for which payment has been made, and (iii) to the extent that it would
not result in a duplication of benefits and to the extent that such service
was recognized under a similar Seller Employee Plan, give each Continuing
Employee service credit for such Continuing Employees employment with the
Acquired Companies for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
credit (but excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan)
under each applicable Purchaser benefit plan as if such service had been
performed with Purchaser.

 

(e) Prior to or at the Reference Time, Seller shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, pay to each Acquired Company Employee a cash amount equal to
the cumulative amount by which the base salary or wage of each such individual
was reduced as a result of a Contagion Event during the period prior to or on
the Closing Date (such that the cumulative amount of base salary or wages
such individual receives during the period prior to or on the Closing Date is
equal to the amount that would have been paid in the absence of any such
reduction) (such amount, the " _Reduced Salary Amount_ ").

 

(f) Prior to or at the Reference Time, and no later than December 31, 2020,
Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, pay to each Acquired Company
Employee a cash amount equal to any then-unpaid portion of each such
individuals 2019 annual bonus and any other earned but unpaid 2019 incentive
compensation (such amounts, collectively, the " _2019 Bonus and
Incentive Compensation Amount_ ").

 



63

    

(g) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide a list of the names
and sites of employment of any and all employees of Seller who were employed
by the Acquired Companies or at any facility acquired by the Acquired
Companies who have experienced, or will experience, an unemployment loss or
layoff (as defined by the WARN Act) within ninety (90) days prior to the
Closing Date.

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
Acquired Company Employee who is on a short-term or long-term disability
leave of absence as of the Closing Date shall remain employed by Seller or its
Affiliates (other than any Acquired Company) following the Closing Date and
shall not become a Continuing Employee as of the Closing. Any such employee
who (i) returns to active status within twelve (12) months of the Closing Date
(or such longer period as is required by applicable Law) and (ii) satisfies
the recurrence period under the applicable disability plan, in each case,
shall be hired by an Acquired Company or other Affiliate of Purchaser at the
time of such return and shall thereafter be a Continuing Employee.

 

(i) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Purchaser, the Acquired
Companies or any other Affiliate of Purchaser, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or any
other Affiliate of Purchaser, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to
discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time
for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section_ __ _
6.10_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other
modification of any Seller Employee Plan or employee benefit plan of Purchaser
or its Affiliates, (ii) prevent Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or any other
Affiliate of Purchaser from amending or terminating any Seller Employee Plans
or employee benefit plan of Purchaser or its Affiliates in accordance with
their terms or (iii) create any third-party rights in any current or former
service provider of the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 6.11 _Environmental Matters_. If applicable to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller, at Sellers sole cost, shall
satisfy and comply with all requirements of the Connecticut Property Transfer
Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 22a-134 et seq., including all filing,
investigatory, remediation, and financial assurance requirements, whether
required prior to, as of, or subsequent to the Closing. Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate in making available any documents or
other information in its possession (including for the avoidance of doubt,
possession of the Acquired Companies after the Closing), executing such
documents, and making its acquired Connecticut facilities accessible (upon
reasonable notice and in such manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with
normal business operations at such facility) as may be necessary, or as Seller
may reasonably request, for Seller to comply with any such requirements.

none of the representations and warranties of any Party contained in this
Agreement or any document or certificate contemplated hereby shall survive the
Closing (other than as set forth in any other Transaction Document) and no

occurrence of the Closing and shall thereupon terminate and no claims may be

this Agreement that by its terms applies or is required to be performed in
whole or in part after the Closing shall survive the Closing until fully
performed or otherwise in accordance with its terms or for a period expressly

would otherwise apply, and no Party shall thereafter assert any claim, cause
of action, right or remedy, or any proceeding, with respect to such provision

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and the other provisions of this _Article
VII_ , from and after the Closing Date, Seller will indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser, its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) and its
and their respective successors, assigns and/or Representatives (collectively,
the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ "), from and against and in respect of any and
all Losses directly or indirectly resulting from, arising out of, relating to,
or incurred by any Purchaser Indemnitee by reason of:

 

(i) any breach or non-performance of any covenant or agreement of Seller
contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, required by
its terms to be performed after the Closing; and

(ii) any out-of-pocket Liabilities to the extent arising out of the ownership
and operation of the Seller-Retained Business, whether arising prior to, at or
after the Closing Date;

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall not be
required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Purchaser Indemnitees
against, or reimburse any Purchaser Indemnitees for, any Losses to the extent
reflected in the determination of Net Working Capital or Closing Indebtedness
on the Closing Statement.

 

Section 7.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and the other provisions of this _Article
VII_ , from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser will indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates (including the Seller-Retained
Subsidiaries) and its and their respective successors, assigns and/or
Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ "), from and
against and in respect of any and all Losses directly or indirectly resulting
from, arising out of, relating to, or imposed upon or incurred by any Seller
Indemnitee by reason of:

 



65

    

(i) any breach or non-performance of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to be performed
after the Closing; and

 

(ii) any out-of-pocket Liabilities to the extent arising out of the ownership
and operation of the Acquired Business (including the Acquired Companies),
whether arising prior to, at or after the Closing Date.

 

Section 7.4 _Limitation of Liability; Disclaimer of Consequential Damages_. TO
THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS
PURSUANT TO _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ ( _CONFIDENTIALITY_ ), NO PARTY WILL BE
LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION OR OTHER SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING
FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF, OR RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF, OR THE FORESEEABILITY
OF, SUCH DAMAGES EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT AN INDEMNITEE IS LIABLE TO AN
UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTY WITH RESPECT THERETO AND ANY SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES
ARE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.

 

Section 7.5 _Indemnification Procedures: Notice of Claim; Defense_.

 

(a) If (i) any third party or Governmental Entity institutes, threatens or
asserts any pending or threatened Action or any other matter or circumstances
that arise, that has given or could reasonably be expected to give rise to
Losses for which a Party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may be liable for
indemnification under this _Article VII_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") or (ii)
any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") believes it has incurred Losses for which a Party may be liable for
indemnification under this _Article VII_ , then the Indemnified Party will,
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within thirty (30) days) send to
the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying (to the extent known) the
nature of such claim and the estimated amount of all related Losses (to the
extent known and quantifiable) (a " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that any failure to give such Claim Notice or to provide any such facts or
amounts will not affect the rights of the Indemnified Party except to the
extent that such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party. Each
Claim Notice shall (i)(A) specify in reasonable detail (to the extent known
and available) all relevant facts, conditions and events, (B) include any
relevant and material documentation related thereto and (C) identify the
specific provisions of this Agreement which give rise to such indemnification
right; and (ii) include a good-faith estimate to the extent known and
quantifiable of the amount of Losses for which the Indemnified Party is
seeking indemnification from the Indemnifying Party.

(b) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect (by
notice to the Indemnified Party delivered within fifteen (15) days of the
receipt of such Claim Notice) to assume the defense and control of such Third
Party Claim and retain counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable to the
relevant Indemnified Parties, to represent such Indemnified Parties in
connection with such Action and will pay all fees, expenses, charges and
disbursements of such counsel; _provided_   _that_ if the Indemnifying Party
assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party has been advised by
counsel in writing that the Indemnifying Party and the

 



66

    

 Indemnified Party have an actual conflict with respect to such action, suit,
proceeding or claim , the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the
Indemnified Party solely in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or
claim shall be considered "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party (i) be responsible
for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel per jurisdiction for all
Indemnified Parties (it being understood that in the case of claims regarding
jurisdictions other than the United States of America, the Indemnified Party
shall be permitted to engage both United States counsel and one counsel in
each relevant foreign jurisdiction, or (ii) assume or conduct the defense of
any claim if (A) a material part of such claim seeks equitable relief (other
than equitable claims that are ancillary to a claim for monetary damages),
(B) such claim is brought by a Material Customer or Material Supplier of any
of the Acquired Companies, (C) the named parties to such claim include both
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and counsel to
the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there are legal
defenses available to such Indemnified Party which are contrary to or
inconsistent with those available to the Indemnifying Party, (D) such claim
seeks criminal sanctions or penalties or (E) the Indemnifying Party assumes
such defense of such claim but upon petition by an Indemnified Party, a court
of competent jurisdiction rules that the Indemnifying Party failed to
diligently conduct such defense in good faith. Should the Indemnifying Party
so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Parties
may have a reasonable opportunity to participate in (but not control) the
defense of such Third Party Claim, at their own expense and through legal
counsel of their choice, in any such Action; _provided_ , that the Indemnified
Parties and their counsel will cooperate with the Indemnifying Partys counsel
in connection with such Action. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
and control of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will have the right
to settle, compromise or discharge a Third Party Claim either (1) subject to
the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party, or (2) without
any Indemnified Partys consent but only if such settlement, compromise or
discharge (w) does not consent to the entry of any judgment, entering into,
offering to enter into any settlement, compromise or discharge or require any
admission of Liability or the validity of any Third Party Claim by any
Indemnified Party, (x) fully, expressly and unconditionally releases all
applicable Indemnified Parties from all Liabilities and obligations with
respect to such Third Party Claim, without prejudice, (y) does not result in
the imposition of injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, and (z) does not result in relief other than
the payment of monetary damages and such monetary damages are paid in full by
the Indemnifying Party at the time of such settlement, compromise or discharge
being imposed on the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the control of the defense of any Third
Party Claim within fifteen (15) days following receipt of a Claim Notice
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to assume and control such defense, but the Indemnifying Party may
nonetheless participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own
counsel and at its own expense and the Indemnified Party will not have the
right to settle, compromise or discharge a Third Party Claim without the
Indemnifying Partys consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Whether the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party controls the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Parties hereto will
reasonably cooperate in the defense thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.5(c)_.

 



67

    

(c) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice, at the reasonable written
request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party will, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, afford the Indemnifying Party and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the books,
records, personnel and properties of the Indemnified Party solely to the
extent reasonably necessary to investigate the Claim Notice. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no Indemnified Party will have any obligation to make available
to the Indemnifying Party any information if making such information
available would (i) jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, or (ii)
contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement (including
any confidentiality agreement to which the Indemnified Party is a party)
(it being understood that Indemnified Party will, at the Indemnifying Partys
sole cost and expense, cooperate in any reasonable efforts and requests for
waivers or other mechanisms that would enable otherwise required disclosure to
the Indemnifying Party to occur without contravening such Law, duty or
agreement or jeopardizing any attorney-client privilege).

 

Section 7.6 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, all Losses shall be
reduced by (a) any net Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates in connection with the incurrence of such Loss, and (b) the
amount of any third-party insurance or reimbursement proceeds that have been
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party in connection with the facts
giving rise to the right of indemnification (it being agreed that: (i) any
such proceeds recovered by the Indemnified Party in pursuit of such
recovery shall be net of out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including any
increases in premiums directly attributable to the underlying claim, incurred
by such Indemnified Party in seeking such recovery; and (ii) if such proceeds
in respect of such facts are actually recovered by the Indemnified Party
subsequent to the Indemnifying Partys making of an indemnification payment in
satisfaction of its applicable indemnification obligation, such proceeds
shall be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party to the extent such
proceeds would have reduced the Indemnifying Partys indemnification
obligations), and the Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its controlled
Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under
applicable insurance and other indemnity and reimbursement provisions covering
such Losses to the same extent as it would if such Losses were not subject
to indemnification hereunder.

Section 7.7 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that, except: (i) in the case
of Actual Fraud, (ii) with respect to the matters covered by _Section_ __ _
1.5_ and (iii) for the Parties right to seek and obtain specific performance
or injunctive relief as provided for in this Agreement, this _Article VII_
will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties from and
after the Closing Date for any claims arising under this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser hereby irrevocably waives
any right of rescission it may otherwise have or to which it may become
entitled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller and its
Affiliates shall have no Liability, for any actual or alleged breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement (or any certificate or
other document delivered hereunder), other than in connection with Actual
Fraud.

(b) Seller and Purchaser agree that the limits imposed on remedies with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby constitute
an integral part of the consideration provided to Seller hereunder, were
specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and their
respective counsel and were specifically taken into account in the
determination of the amounts to be paid to Seller hereunder.

 



68

    

Section 7.8 _Mitigation_ _._ The Parties shall cooperate with each other
with respect to resolving any claim or liability underlying any Loss with
respect to which one Party is obligated to indemnify any Person hereunder, and
each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate its respective indemnifiable Losses upon and after becoming aware of
any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

 

Section 7.9 _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding the fact that any Person may
have the right to assert claims for indemnification under or in respect of
more than one provision of this Agreement related to any fact, event,
condition or circumstance, no Person will be entitled to recover the amount of
any Losses suffered by such Person more than once under this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents in respect of the same fact, event, condition
or circumstance.

Section 7.10 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties hereto agree
to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article VII_ as an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for all applicable Tax purposes, except
to the extent required by applicable Law.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION

 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing: 

(a) by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller;

 

(b) by written notice from Purchaser or Seller, if any court or other
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a
final order, decree or ruling or taken any other final action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Transactions contemplated
hereunder and such order, decree, ruling or other action is or shall have
become final and nonappealable; _provided_ that any breach of this Agreement
by the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement shall not have caused or
resulted in such restraint, injunction or other prohibition; or the failure of
such restraint, injunction or other prohibition to be removed.

(c) by written notice from either Purchaser or Seller if the Closing shall not
have occurred on or before December 31, 2020 (the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ shall not be available to the Party seeking to
terminate if any action of such Party or the failure of such Party to perform
any of its obligations under this Agreement required to be performed at or
prior to the Closing has been the primary cause of the failure of the Closing

not been waived in writing by Seller and such breach is not curable or, if

thereof is given by Seller to Purchaser or (B) the Termination Date;
_provided_ that Seller shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement

of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained

that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions are
capable at the time of termination of being satisfied if the Closing were to

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any Party hereto, except as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, _Section_ __ _ 5.6(c)_, _Section_ __ _
6.1_, this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and _Article IX_ , each of which shall
survive such termination; _provided_ that, subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(d)_, nothing herein shall relieve any
Party hereto of any liability for damages resulting from Willful Breach prior
to such termination by any Party hereto. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall be deemed to affect their
right to specific performance under _Section_ __ _ 9.9_.

(b) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Seller pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 8.1(d) _or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an
amount equal to $35,000,000 (the " _Purchaser Termination Fee_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, such payment to be made within seven
(7) Business Days of the date of the termination of this Agreement.

(c) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the Purchaser Termination
Fee if, as and when required pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall not
constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount
that will compensate Seller in the circumstances in which it is payable for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The
Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall Purchaser be
required to pay the Purchaser Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



70

    

(d) Each of Seller and Purchaser acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Parties
would not enter into this Agreement. Any amount payable pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ shall be paid by Purchaser by wire transfer of same
day funds prior to or on the date such payment is required to be made under
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_. If Purchaser fails to pay the Purchaser Termination
Fee when the Purchaser Termination Fee is due and payable pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, and in order to obtain such payment, Seller commences an
Action that results in a judgment against Purchaser for the payment of the
Purchaser Termination Fee, Purchaser shall pay to the accounts designated by
Seller, together with the Purchaser Termination Fee, any reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket legal fees) incurred by Seller in respect of any
such Action (such fees, costs and expenses, the " _Collection Costs_ ");
_provided_ , that in no case shall the amount of Collection Costs exceed
$3,000,000; _further_ ,  _provided_ , that if it is determined in an Action
that the Purchaser Termination Fee is not owed to Seller pursuant to this
Agreement, Seller shall pay to an account designated in writing by Purchaser
the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal fees) incurred by
Purchaser in respect of any such Action up to that same cap.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in any
circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and Seller is paid and
accepts the Purchaser Termination Fee from Purchaser pursuant to the terms
hereof, the Purchaser Termination Fee and, if applicable, Collection Costs,
shall, subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.9_, be the sole and exclusive monetary
remedy and recourse of Seller, Acquired Companies and their Affiliates against
Purchaser, the Sponsors or any of their former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, controlling Persons, managers, members,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, affiliated (or commonly advised)
funds, Representatives, agents or any their respective assignees or successors
or any former, current or future general or limited partner, stockholder,
controlling Person, manager, member, director, officer, employee, Affiliate,
affiliated (or commonly advised) fund, representative, agent, assignee or
successor of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Purchaser Related
Parties_ ") or any Financing Source and any of its Affiliates (a " _Lender
Related Party_ ") for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure
of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, the
Debt Financing and/or the Debt Financing Documents, or for a breach of, or
failure to perform under, this Agreement, any certificate or other document
delivered in connection herewith, the Debt Financing and/or the Debt
Financing Documents or otherwise or in respect of any oral representation made
or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, and upon
payment of such amounts, none of the Purchaser Related Parties or Lender
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or in respect of representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith, whether in equity or at Law, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, except that nothing shall relieve Purchaser of its
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 5.6(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and _Section_
__ _ 6.1(c)_. In the event the Purchaser Termination Fee and any
Collection Costs are paid, Seller, the Acquired Companies, and their
respective Affiliates shall not be entitled to bring or maintain any Action
against Purchaser, the Sponsors or any of their respective Affiliates or other
Purchaser Related Parties or Lender Related Parties arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or any
matters forming the basis of any terminations of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, all of which Actions shall be deemed irrevocably
waived.

 



71

    

(f) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of
action that may be based upon or under this Agreement (or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement) may only be made against the
entities that are expressly identified as Parties hereto and pursuant to, and
in accordance with, the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter or the
Confidentiality Agreement (and, in each case, only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein or therein), or the parties thereto, and
no other Seller Related Party or Purchaser Related Party (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Sponsors or the other Purchaser Related Parties party
to Equity Commitment Letter or the Confidentiality Agreement, pursuant to, and
in accordance with the terms thereof) shall have any liability (whether
in tort, contract or otherwise) for any obligations or liabilities of the
Parties to this Agreement or for any claim against the Parties to this
Agreement (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith.
The provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_ and this  _Section_ __ _
8.2(f)_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each
Purchaser Related Party, Seller Related Party and Lender Related Party and
each such Person shall be a third party beneficiary of  _Section_ __ _
8.2(e)_ and this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(f)_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, in no event shall anything contained in _Section_ __ _
8.2(e)_ and this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(f)_ prevent or otherwise limit any
claim for Actual Fraud against any Person.

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 9.1 _Entire Agreement; Assignment; Successors_. This Agreement
(including all annexes, exhibits and Disclosure Letters), the Equity
Commitment Letter, Confidentiality Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents constitute the entire agreement among the Parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior
and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and
no Party is relying on any other prior oral or written representations,
agreements, understandings or undertakings with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of Law
or otherwise, by any Party without the prior written consent of the other
Party hereto, and any such assignment of this Agreement in contravention of
this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ __ will be null and void and of no force or effect;
_provided_ that (a) Purchaser (or one or more of its Affiliates) shall have
the right, without the prior written consent of Seller, to assign all or any
portion of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement, from
and after Closing, to any Financing Sources (so long as Purchaser remains
fully liable for all of its obligations hereunder) pursuant to the terms of
any Debt Financing for purposes of creating a security interests herein or
otherwise assigning collateral in respect of such Debt Financing; and (b)
Purchaser may, without the prior consent of any other Party, assign its rights
and benefits under this Agreement to its Affiliates, any of its subsidiaries
and its and their respective successors and assigns; _provided_ that, no such

Purchaser under this Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, each Party hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 9.2 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and
effect, so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not

 



72

    

 affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto will negotiate in good faith

Section 9.4 _Governing Law_ _; Submission to Jurisdiction_ _; Waiver of
Jury Trial_.

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.16_, this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby and any disputes or claims relating hereto shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to any applicable principles of choice of law
or conflicts of law that would require the application of any other law other
than the State of Delaware. Each of the Parties irrevocably (i) consents to
submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or
federal court within the State of Delaware), in connection with any matter
based upon or arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of Purchaser or Seller in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof and thereof,
(ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
courts of the State of Delaware, as described above, and (iv) consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.3_. Each of Seller and Purchaser hereby agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ shall be effective service of
process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, that it or its property is exempt
or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that
the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or that
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced
in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder,
fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the
Party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction. Each Party expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is
intended to be irrevocable under the Laws of the State of Delaware and of the
United States of America;  _provided_ that each such Partys consent to
jurisdiction and service contained in this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ is solely for
the purpose referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ and shall not be deemed
to be a general submission to said courts or in the State of Delaware other
than for such purpose.

(b) TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW THEN IN EFFECT, EACH PARTY
HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDINGS OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PURCHASER OR SELLER IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

Section 9.8 _Amendment and Modification_. Subject to the provisions of
applicable Law and except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.15_, this
Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether
by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing
specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed by an authorized
representative of each of the Parties.

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, may not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without
any requirement for the posting of security, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The Parties
hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, each Party
shall be entitled to specific performance to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement,
including _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, by any other Party
and to cause such other Party to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _
1.3_, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein or in any Transaction Document to the
contrary, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be
entitled to specific performance to cause Purchaser to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing if, but only if, (i) all
conditions in _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but each of which is capable of
being, and is reasonably expected to be, satisfied at Closing) have been
satisfied or waived at the time when the Closing would have occurred
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, (ii) Purchaser is required to
complete the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ and Purchaser fails to
complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, (iii) the financing provided for by the Debt
Financing Commitment (or, if applicable, the Alternative Financing) has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing and (iv) Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Purchaser
that, if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt
Financing are funded, Seller stands ready, willing and able to consummate
the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ (and Seller shall not have
delivered written notice purporting to revoke such written confirmation). Each
of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (x) either Party has an adequate remedy at Law or (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. Notwithstanding anything else
to the contrary in this Agreement, for the avoidance of doubt, while Seller
may concurrently seek (i) specific performance or other equitable relief,
subject in all respects to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ and (ii) payment of the
Purchaser Termination Fee or monetary damages if, as and when required
pursuant to this Agreement, under no circumstances shall Seller be permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to cause the
Closing to occur (or other equitable remedy), on the one hand, and either
payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee or damages (but never both), on

 



76

    

 the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting any right of
Seller with respect to the Purchaser Termination Fee, in no event shall Seller
or any of the Acquired Companies be entitled to specific performance of
Purchasers obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to
consummate the Closing if the Debt Financing (or any Alternative Financing)
has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing).

Section 9.10 _Legal Representation_. Purchaser agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of each of its directors, officers, managers, employees and
Affiliates, that, following the Closing, Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP may
serve as counsel to Seller and its Affiliates in connection with any matters
related to this Agreement and the contemplated transactions, including any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the contemplated transactions (the " _Acquisition Representation_ ")
notwithstanding any representation by Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP prior to
the Closing Date of the Acquired Companies. Purchaser and the Acquired
Companies hereby (a) waive any claim they have or may have that Simpson
Thacher and Bartlett LLP has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited
from engaging in such Acquisition Representation and (b) agree that, in the
event that a dispute arises either before or after the Closing between
Purchaser and Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, Simpson Thacher and
Bartlett LLP may represent Seller or any of its Affiliates in such dispute
even though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to
Purchaser or the Acquired Companies and even though Simpson Thacher and
Bartlett LLP may have represented the Acquired Companies in connection with
the Acquisition Representation. Purchaser and the Acquired Companies also
further agree that, as to all communications prior to Closing among Simpson
Thacher and Bartlett LLP and the Acquired Companies, Seller or Sellers
Affiliates and Representatives, that relate in any way to the Acquisition
Representation, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of
client confidence belongs to Seller and may be controlled by Seller and shall
not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or the Acquired Companies.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and a third party other than a Party to
this Agreement after the Closing, the Acquired Companies may control and
assert the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence
to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Simpson Thacher and
Bartlett LLP to such third party; _provided_ , however, that the Acquired
Companies may not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
Seller.

 

Section 9.11 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided
herein, each Party shall bear its own expenses in connection with or related
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not
such transactions are consummated. Filing fees incurred in connection with
applications and filings under the HSR Act or any Antitrust Law shall
be borne by Purchaser.

Section 9.12 _No Recourse_. This Agreement shall not create or be deemed to
create or permit any personal liability or obligation on the part of any
direct or indirect stockholder of the Seller Entities or any officer,
director, employee, Representative or investor of any Party hereto.

 

Section 9.13 _Purchaser Release_. Except as contemplated by _Article VII_ or
in the case of Actual Fraud, from and after the Closing, Purchaser agrees, on
behalf of itself, its subsidiaries and its Affiliates (and, from and after the
Closing, shall cause, and shall be deemed through execution of this Agreement
to have caused, the Acquired Companies, their respective subsidiaries and
Affiliates to agree), that none of Seller, their Affiliates, their current or
former officers and directors or any of their respective Representatives,
whether in any individual, corporate, or any other capacity (the " _Seller _

 



77

    

  _Released Parties_ ") shall have any liability or responsibility to
Purchaser nor any of the Acquired Companies for (and Purchaser hereby
unconditionally irrevocably waives, acquits, remises, discharges and forever
releases, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (and from and after the
Closing shall cause, and shall be deemed through execution of this Agreement
to have caused, the Acquired Companies to unconditionally irrevocably waive,
acquit, remise, discharge and forever release), Seller Released Parties from)
any and all obligations or Liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever
whether in the capacity as an equityholder of the Acquired Companies
or otherwise, in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated, known or unknown, matured or unmatured or determined or
determinable, and whether arising under any Law, contract, agreement,
arrangement, commitment, undertaking or understanding, whether written or
oral or otherwise at Law or in equity: (a) arising out of, or relating to, the
organization, management or operation of the businesses of the Acquired
Companies relating to any matter, occurrence, action or activity on or prior
to the Closing Date, (b) relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, except, in the case of Seller, for covenants and
agreements which contemplate performance after the Closing or
otherwise expressly by their terms survive the Closing, each of which will
survive in accordance with its terms, (c) arising out of or due to any
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty or the breach of any
covenant, undertaking or other agreement contained in this Agreement, the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto or in any Transaction Document or certificate
contemplated hereby and delivered in connection herewith, except, in the case
of Seller, with respect to the covenants and agreements which contemplate
performance after the Closing or otherwise expressly by their terms survive
the Closing, each of which will survive in accordance with its terms, or (d)
relating to any information, documents or materials furnished by or on behalf
