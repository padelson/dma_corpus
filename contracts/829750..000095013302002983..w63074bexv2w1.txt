                                   ARTICLE III

                 CONSIDERATION; ELECTION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

      3.01 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock:

      (a) Each share of Parent Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and
shall be unchanged by the Merger.

      (b) Each share of Company Common Stock held as Treasury Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time
and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

      (c) (1) Subject to Sections 3.02, 3.05, 3.06 and 3.07, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.01(b)) shall
be converted into, and shall be canceled in exchange for, the right to receive,
at the election of the holder thereof:

            (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock which is equal to
      the quotient (the "Exchange Ratio") determined by dividing (x) $15.75 by
      (y) the Average Share Price of the Parent Common Stock (the "Per Share
      Stock Consideration"), or

            (ii) a cash amount equal to $15.75 per share of Company Common Stock
      (the "Per Share Cash Consideration").

            (2) For purposes of this Agreement:

            (i) the "Aggregate Cash Consideration" shall amount to the product
      of the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Treasury
      Stock) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time times .5 times
      $15.75; and

            (ii) the "Average Share Price" of the Parent Common Stock shall mean
      the average of the closing sales price of a share of Parent Common Stock,
      as reported on Nasdaq (as reported by an authoritative source), for the 20
      trading-day period ending with the close of business on the Business Day
      preceding the Effective Time.

      3.02. Election Procedures.

      (a) Parent shall designate an exchange agent to act as agent (the
"Exchange Agent") for purposes of conducting the election procedure and the
exchange procedure described in Sections 3.01 and 3.02. Provided that the
Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all
information which is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its obligations
as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall, no later than five (5) Business
Days


                                       10
<PAGE>


after the Effective Date, mail or make available to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates (i) a notice and letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates theretofore representing shares of Company Common Stock shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) advising
such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for
surrendering to the Exchange Agent such Certificate or Certificates in exchange
for the consideration set forth in Section 3.01(c) hereof deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) an election form in such form as
Parent and the Company shall mutually agree (the "Election Form"). Each Election
Form shall permit the holder (or in the case of nominee record holders, the
beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation) (i) to elect to
receive Parent Common Stock with respect to all of such holder's Company Common
Stock as hereinabove provided (the "Stock Election Shares"), (ii) to elect to
receive cash with respect to all of such holder's Company Common Stock as
hereinabove provided (the "Cash Election Shares"), or (iii) to indicate that
such holder makes no such election with respect to such holder's shares of
Company Common Stock (the "No-Election Shares"). Nominee record holders who hold
Company Common Stock on behalf of multiple beneficial owners shall indicate how
many of the shares held by them are Stock Election Shares, Cash Election Shares
and No-Election Shares. If a shareholder either (i) does not submit a properly
completed Election Form in a timely fashion or (ii) revokes an Election Form
prior to the Election Deadline and does not resubmit a properly completed
Election Form prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock
held by such shareholder shall be designated No-Election Shares. Any Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to be Cash Election Shares, and with respect to such
shares the holders thereof shall in no event be classified as holders of
Reallocated Stock Shares.

      (b) The term "Election Deadline" shall mean 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on
the 20th day following but not including the date of mailing of the Election
Form or such other date as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree upon.

      (c) Any election to receive Parent Common Stock or cash shall have been
properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly
completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form will be
properly completed only if accompanied by Certificates representing all shares
of Company Common Stock covered thereby, subject to the provisions of paragraph
(c) of Section 3.03. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person
submitting such Election Form to the Exchange Agent by written notice to the
Exchange Agent only if such written notice is actually received by the Exchange
Agent at or prior to the Election Deadline. The Certificate or Certificates
representing Company Common Stock relating to any revoked Election Form shall be
promptly returned without charge to the person submitting the Election Form to
the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine when any election, modification or revocation is received, whether any
such election, modification or revocation has been properly made and to
disregard immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any good faith decisions
of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive.
Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify
any person of any defect in an Election Form.


                                       11
<PAGE>


      (d) Within ten (10) Business Days after the Election Deadline, the
Exchange Agent shall effect the allocation among holders of Company Common Stock
of rights to receive Parent Common Stock or cash in the Merger in accordance
with the Election Forms as follows:

            (i) If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Per Share Cash
      Consideration is less than the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then:

                        (1) all Cash Election Shares (subject to Section 3.06
                  with respect to Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the
                  right to receive cash,

                        (2) No-Election Shares shall then be deemed to be Cash
                  Election Shares to the extent necessary to have the total
                  number of Cash Election Shares times the Per Share Cash
                  Consideration equal the Aggregate Cash Consideration. If less
                  than all of the No-Election Shares need to be treated as Cash
                  Election Shares, then the Exchange Agent shall select which
                  No-Election Shares shall be treated as Cash Election Shares in
                  such manner as the Exchange Agent shall determine, and all
                  remaining No-Election Shares shall thereafter be treated as
                  Stock Election Shares,

                        (3) If all of the No-Election Shares are treated as Cash
                  Election Shares under the preceding subsection and the total
                  number of Cash Election Shares times the Per Share Cash
                  Consideration is less than the Aggregate Cash Consideration,
                  then the Exchange Agent shall convert on a pro rata basis as
                  described below in Section 3.02(e) a sufficient number of
                  Stock Election Shares into Cash Election Shares ("Reallocated
                  Cash Shares") such that the sum of the number of Cash Election
                  Shares plus the number of Reallocated Cash Shares times the
                  Per Share Cash Consideration equals the Aggregate Cash
                  Consideration, and all Reallocated Cash Shares will be
                  converted into the right to receive cash, and

                        (4) the Stock Election Shares which are not Reallocated
                  Cash Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
                  Parent Common Stock.

            (ii) If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Per Share Cash
      Consideration is greater than the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then:

                        (1) all Stock Election Shares and all No-Election Shares
                  shall be converted into the right to receive Parent Common
                  Stock,

                        (2) the Exchange Agent shall convert on a pro rata basis
                  as described below in Section 3.02(e) a sufficient number of
                  Cash Election Shares (excluding any Dissenting Shares)
                  ("Reallocated Stock Shares") such that the number of remaining
                  Cash Election Shares (including Dissenting Shares) times the
                  Per Share Cash Consideration equals the Aggregate Cash
                  Consideration, and all Reallocated Stock Shares shall be
                  converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock, and


                                       12
<PAGE>


                        (3) the Cash Election Shares (subject to Section 3.06
                  with respect to Dissenting Shares) which are not Reallocated
                  Stock Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
                  cash.

                  (iii) If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Per
            Share Cash Consideration is equal to the Aggregate Cash
            Consideration, then subparagraphs (d)(i) and (ii) above shall not
            apply and all No-Election Shares and all Stock Election Shares will
            be converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock.

         (e) In the event that the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to
Section 3.02(d)(i)(3) to convert some Stock Election Shares into Reallocated
Cash Shares, each holder of Stock Election Shares shall be allocated a pro rata
portion of the total Reallocated Cash Shares. In the event the Exchange Agent is
required pursuant to Section 3.02(d)(ii)(2) to convert some Cash Election Shares
into Reallocated Stock Shares, each holder of Cash Election Shares shall be
allocated a pro rata portion of the total Reallocated Stock Shares.

         (f) If at the time of the Closing, the aggregate value of the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be exchanged for shares of Company Common Stock is less
than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate value of the Merger Consideration,
then Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent to convert a minimum number of
No-Election Shares, and to the extent necessary a minimum number of Cash
Election Shares, into Stock Election Shares so that the aggregate value of the
shares of Parent Common Stock exchanged for shares of Company Common Stock
(other than cash in lieu of fractional shares) constitutes fifty percent (50%)
of the aggregate value of the Merger Consideration. For purposes of this Section
3.02(f) only, the value of a share of Parent Common Stock will be the value as
of the time of the Closing as determined for federal income tax purposes.

         3.03. Exchange Procedures.

         (a) At the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, (i) Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent certificates
evidencing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and (ii) Parent
shall deliver, or cause Parent Bank to deliver, to the Exchange Agent the
Aggregate Cash Consideration payable, pursuant to this Article III in exchange
for Certificates representing outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The
Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock held by it from time to time
hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of
the persons entitled thereto.

         (b) After completion of the allocation referred to in paragraph (d) of
Section 3.02, each holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates who has
surrendered such Certificate or Certificates to the Exchange Agent will, upon
acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to a certificate or
certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and/or the amount of cash into which the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates
surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and, if such
holder's shares of Company


                                       13
<PAGE>


Common Stock have been converted into Parent Common Stock, any other
distribution theretofore paid with respect to Parent Common Stock issuable in
the Merger, in each case without interest. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. Each outstanding Certificate which prior to the
Effective Time represented Company Common Stock and which is not surrendered to
the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures provided for herein shall,
except as otherwise herein provided, until duly surrendered to the Exchange
Agent be deemed to evidence ownership of the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock or the right to receive the amount of cash into which such Company Common
Stock shall have been converted. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further transfer on the records of the Company of Certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock and if such Certificates are presented to the
Company for transfer, they shall be cancelled against delivery of certificates
for Parent Common Stock or cash as hereinabove provided. No dividends which have
been declared will be remitted to any person entitled to receive shares of
Parent Common Stock under Section 3.02 until such person surrenders the
Certificate or Certificates representing Company Common Stock, at which time
such dividends shall be remitted to such person, without interest.

         (c) The Exchange Agent and Parent, as the case may be, shall not be
obligated to deliver cash and/or a certificate or certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the
Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange as provided in this Section 3.03, or, in default thereof, an
appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount
as may be reasonably required in each case by Parent. If any certificates
evidencing shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than
that in which the Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by
an executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

         (d) Any portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash delivered
to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) that remains
unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for six months after the Effective
Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by
the Exchange Agent to Parent. Any shareholders of Company who have not
theretofore complied with Section 3.03(b) shall thereafter look only to Parent
for the consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement without
any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of Company Common
Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the
date on which such shares of Parent Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed
items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned


                                       14
<PAGE>


property and any other applicable law, become the property of Parent (and to the
extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled to such property. Neither
the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder
of stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer
books of the Company to establish the identity of those persons entitled to
receive the consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be
conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to
ownership of stock represented by any Certificate, Parent and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deposit any consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.

         (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Company Affiliate shall not be
exchanged for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such Company Affiliate may be entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
until Parent has received a written agreement from such person as specified in
Section 6.07.

         3.04. Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers. At the Effective Time,
holders of Company Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
shareholders of the Company other than to receive the consideration provided
under this Article III. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of shares
of Company Stock.

         3.05. No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common Stock who
otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder)
shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by
multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise
be entitled by the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq on
the Business Day preceding the Effective Time (as reported in The Wall Street
Journal, or if not reported therein, in another authoritative source), rounded
to the nearest whole cent. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting
rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share.

         3.06. Dissenting Shares. Each outstanding share of Company Common Stock
the holder of which has perfected his right to dissent under the MBCL and has
not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock or cash hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the MBCL. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice upon receipt by the Company of any such written demands for
payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock and of
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments provided pursuant to the
MBCL. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall fail to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent at or prior to the Effective
Time and shall have delivered a properly completed Election Form to the Exchange
Agent by the Election Deadline, the Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall
be


                                       15
<PAGE>


converted into a right to receive Company Common Stock and/or cash in accordance
with the applicable provisions of this Agreement; and if any such holder of
Dissenting Shares shall not have delivered a properly completed Election Form to
the Exchange Agent by the Election Deadline, the Dissenting Shares held by such
holder shall be designated No-Election Shares. If any holder of Dissenting
Shares shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) after the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares
held by such holder shall be converted on a share by share basis into either the
right to receive Parent Common Stock and/or cash in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement as Parent or the Exchange Agent shall
determine. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by
the Surviving Corporation.

         3.07. Anti-Dilution Provisions. If, between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or
a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly.

         3.08. Withholding Rights. Parent (through the Exchange Agent, if
applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as Parent is required under the Code or any state, local or
foreign tax law or regulation thereunder to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

         3.09.    Company Options.

         (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option which is then
outstanding, whether or not exercisable, shall become fully vested and
exercisable, and shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase
shares of Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each Company Option, in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option Plan and stock
option or other agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after
the Effective Time, (i) Parent and the Human Resources Committee of its Board of
Directors shall be substituted for the Company (or the Company Bank) and the
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company or the Company Bank
(including, if applicable, the entire Board of Directors of the Company)
administering such Company Stock Option Plan, (ii) each Company Option assumed
by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (iii) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Company Option shall be
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
provided that any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest share, and (iv) the per
share exercise price under each such Company Option shall be adjusted by
dividing the per share exercise price under each such Company Option by the
Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the
nearest cent. Notwithstanding clauses (iii) and (iv) of the preceding sentence,
each Company Option which is an "incentive


                                       16
<PAGE>


stock option" shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification,
extension or renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the
Code. Parent and the Company agree to take all necessary steps to effect the
foregoing provisions of this Section 3.09(a).

         (b) Within five Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or
any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to the options referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section
3.09 and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein for so long as such options remain
outstanding in the case of a Form S-8 or, in the case of a Form S-3, until the
shares subject to such options may be sold without a further holding period
under Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties
contained in Section 5.03 or 5.04 or to one or more of its covenants contained
in Article IV; provided, however, that (a) no such item is required to be set
forth in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty
if its absence would not be reasonably likely to result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard
established by Section 5.02 and (b) the mere inclusion of an item in a
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be
deemed an admission by a party that such item represents a material exception or

Schedule, such item is or would be reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

         5.02. Standard. No representation or warranty of the Company or Parent
contained in Sections 5.03 or 5.04, respectively, shall be deemed untrue or
incorrect, and no party hereto shall be deemed to have breached a representation

representation or warranty contained in Section 5.03 or 5.04, has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the party making such
representation or warranty.

         material respects as to form with the applicable securities regulations
         of the SEC as the case may be and (B) did not and will not contain any
         untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
         required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
         therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
         not misleading, except that information as of a later date shall be
         deemed to modify information as of an earlier date; and each of the
         balance sheets contained in any such SEC Document (including the
         related notes and schedules thereto) fairly presents, or will fairly
         present, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
         Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of
         income and changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows or equivalent

         accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
         except in each case as may be noted therein.

                  (ii) Since March 31, 2002, neither the Company nor any of its
         Subsidiaries has incurred any liability other than in the ordinary
         course of business consistent with past practice (excluding the
         incurrence of expenses related to this Agreement and the transactions
         contemplated hereby).

                  (iii) Since March 31, 2002, (A) the Company and its
         Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary
         and usual course consistent with past practice (excluding the
         incurrence of expenses related to this Agreement and the transactions
         contemplated hereby) and (B) no event has occurred or circumstance
         arisen that, individually or taken together with all other facts,
         circumstances and events (described in any paragraph of this Section
         5.03 or otherwise), is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
         Effect with respect to the Company.

                  (iv) No agreement pursuant to which any loans or other assets
         have been or shall be sold by the Company or its Subsidiaries entitled
         the buyer of such loans or other assets, unless there is material

         Subsidiaries, to cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to repurchase
         such loan or other asset or the buyer to pursue any other form of
         recourse against the Company or its Subsidiaries. Except for regular
         quarterly cash dividends on the Company Common Stock and a special

         other dividend or any other distribution with respect to the stock of
         the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been declared, set aside or
         paid. No shares of the stock of the Company have been purchased,
         redeemed or otherwise acquired, directly or indirectly, by the Company
         since March 31, 2002, and no agreements have been made to do the
         foregoing.

         (h) Litigation. No litigation, claim or other proceeding before any
court or governmental agency is pending against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and, to the


                                       24

Company's knowledge, no such litigation, claim or other proceeding has been
threatened and there are no facts which could reasonably give rise to such
litigation, claim or other proceeding.

         (i)      Regulatory Matters.

                  (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
         any of their respective properties is a party to or is subject to any
         order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding or similar
         arrangement with, or a commitment letter or similar submission to, or
         extraordinary supervisory letter from, any federal or state
         governmental agency or authority charged with the supervision or
         regulation of financial institutions or issuers of securities or
         engaged in the insurance of deposits or the supervision or regulation
         of it (collectively, the "Company Regulatory Authorities"). The Company
         and its Subsidiaries have paid all assessments made or imposed by any
         Company Regulatory Authority.

                  (ii) Neither the Company nor any its Subsidiaries has been
         advised by, or has any knowledge of facts which could give rise to an
         advisory notice by, any Company Regulatory Authority that such Company
         Regulatory Authority is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is
         considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such
         order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment
         letter, supervisory letter or similar submission.

         (j)      Compliance With Laws. Each of the Company and its

         (k)      Material Contracts; Defaults.

                  (i) Except for documents listed as exhibits to the Company's
         SEC Documents, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
         party to, bound by or subject to any agreement, contract, arrangement,
         commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) (i) with respect
         to the employment of any directors, officers, employees or consultants,
         (ii) which would entitle any present or former director, officer,
         employee or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries to indemnification
         from the Company or its Subsidiaries, (iii) which is a material
         contract (as defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)
         to be performed after the date of this Agreement that has not been
         filed or incorporated by reference in the Company's SEC Documents, (iv)
         which is a consulting agreement (including data processing, software
         programming and licensing contracts) not terminable on 60 days or less
         notice and involving the payment of more than $50,000 per annum or (v)
         which materially restricts the conduct of any business by the Company
         or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Material Contracts"). The
         Company has Previously Disclosed and made available to Parent true and
         correct copies of each such document.

                  (ii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
         material default under any contract, agreement, commitment,
         arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other instrument to which it is
         a party, by which its respective assets, business, or operations may be
         bound or affected, or under which it or its respective assets,
         business, or operations receives benefits, and there has not occurred
         any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both,
         would constitute such a default. No power of attorney or similar
         authorization given directly or indirectly by the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries is currently outstanding.

         (l) No Brokers. No action has been taken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that would give rise to any valid claim against any party hereto
for a brokerage commission, finder's fee or other like payment with respect to
the Transactions, excluding a Previously Disclosed fee to be paid to RBC Dain
Rausher Inc., a member company of RBC Capital Markets.

         (m) Employee Benefit Plans.


                  (i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or
         arrangements covering current or former employees of the Company and
         its Subsidiaries (the "Employees") and current or former directors of
         the Company including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans"
         within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, and deferred compensation,
         stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based,
         incentive and bonus plans (the "Benefits Plans"), are Previously
         Disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule. True and complete copies of all
         Benefit Plans including, but not limited to, any trust instruments and
         insurance contracts forming a part of any Benefit Plans and all
         amendments thereto have been provided or made available to Parent.

                  (ii) All Benefits Plans other than "multiemployer plans"
         within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, covering Employees, to
         the extent subject to ERISA, are in


                                       26
<PAGE>


         substantial compliance with ERISA. Each Benefit Plan which is an
         "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
         ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and which is intended to be qualified under
         Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination
         letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and the Company is not aware
         of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such
         favorable determination letter or the loss of the qualification of such
         Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. There is no material
         pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened litigation relating
         to the Benefits Plans. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
         has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Benefit Plan or
         Pension Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction
         expired as of the date hereof, could subject the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the
         Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material.

                  (iii) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA
         has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated
         "single-employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of
         ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the
         single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one employer
         with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code
         (an "ERISA Affiliate"). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
         has incurred, and neither expects to incur, any withdrawal liability
         with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of
         ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA
         Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of
         Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has
         not been waived, has been required to be filed for any Pension Plan or
         by any ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month period ending on the date
         hereof or will be required to be filed in connection with the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of
         any Benefit Plan have been timely made or have been reflected on the
         financial statements of the Company included in the Company's SEC
         Documents. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an
         ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not
         waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
         ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither
         the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to
         provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of
         an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

                  (v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
         obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Benefit
         Plan, other than coverage as may be required under Section 4980B of the
         Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, or under the continuation of
         coverage provisions of the laws of any state or locality. The Company
         or any of its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such Benefit Plan
         at any time without incurring any liability thereunder.

                  (vi) None of the execution of this Agreement, shareholder
         approval of this Agreement or consummation of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement will (A)


                                       27
<PAGE>


         entitle any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
         severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of
         employment after the date hereof, (B) accelerate the time of payment or
         vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or
         otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount
         payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any of
         the Benefit Plans, (C) result in any breach or violation of, or a
         default under, any of the Benefit Plans or (D) result in any payment
         that would be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as
         those terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code, without regard to
         whether such payment is reasonable compensation for personal services
         performed or to be performed in the future.

         (n) Labor Matters. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or is bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that it
has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor
Relations Act) or seeking to compel the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor
is there any strike or other labor dispute involving it or any of its
Subsidiaries pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened, nor is the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries aware of any activity involving its employees
seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in other
organizational activity.

                  (i) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
         applicable Environmental Laws; (ii) to the Company's knowledge, no real
         property (including buildings or other structures) currently or
         formerly owned or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
         or any property in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
         held a security interest, Lien or a fiduciary or management role
         ("Company Loan Property"), has been contaminated with, or has had any
         release of, any Hazardous Substance except in compliance with
         Environmental Laws; (iii) neither the Company nor any of its
         Subsidiaries could be deemed the owner or operator of, or has

         release of, any Hazardous Substance except in compliance with
         Environmental Laws; (iv) neither the Company nor any of its
         Subsidiaries has any liability for any Hazardous Substance disposal or
         contamination on any third party property; (v) neither the Company nor

         or request for information alleging any violation of, or liability

         prior manufacturing operations, dry-cleaning, or automotive services)
         involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any currently or
         formerly owned or operated property, or any Company Loan Property, that
         could reasonably be expected to result in any claims, liability or
         investigations against the Company or any of its


                                       28
<PAGE>


         Subsidiaries, result in any restrictions on the ownership, use, or
         transfer of any property pursuant to any Environmental Law, or

         Company has Previously Disclosed and made available to Parent copies of
         all environmental reports or studies, sampling data, correspondence and

combinations thereof) (each, a "Derivatives Contract") or owns securities that
(i) are referred to generically as "structured notes," "high risk mortgage
derivatives," "capped floating rate notes" or "capped floating rate mortgage

ordinary course of business, consistent with safe and sound banking practices
and regulatory guidance. All of such Derivatives Contracts or other instruments,
are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as enforcement
may be limited by general principles of equity whether applied in a court of law
or a court of equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights and remedies generally), and are in full force and effect. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material respects all of
their material obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to
perform have accrued; and, to the Company's knowledge, there are no breaches,
violations or

defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder which
would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

         (r) Loans; Nonperforming and Classified Assets.

                  (i) Each Loan on the books and records of the Company and its
         Subsidiaries, was made and has been serviced in all material respects
         in accordance with customary lending standards in the ordinary course
         of business, is evidenced in all material respects by appropriate and
         sufficient documentation and, to the knowledge of the Company,
         constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor
         named therein, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
         moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general
         applicability relating to or affecting creditor's rights or by general
         equity principles.

                  (ii) The Company has Previously Disclosed as to the Company
         and each Company Subsidiary as of the latest practicable date: (A) any
         written or, to the Company's knowledge, oral Loan under the terms of
         which the obligor is 60 or more days delinquent in payment of principal
         or interest, or to the Company's knowledge, in default of any other
         material provision thereof; (B) each Loan which has been classified as
         "substandard," "doubtful," "loss" or "special mention" (or words of
         similar import) by the Company, a Company Subsidiary or an applicable
         regulatory authority (it being understood that no representation is
         being made that the FDIC or the Massachusetts Bank Commissioner would
         agree with the loan classifications established by the Company); (C) a
         listing of the OREO acquired by foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu thereof,
         including the book value thereof; and (D) each Loan with any director,

         or a Company Subsidiary, or to the best knowledge of the Company, any
         Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of
         the foregoing.

         (s) Properties. All real and personal property owned by the Company or
a Subsidiary of the Company or presently used by any of them in its respective
business is in an adequate condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and is
sufficient to carry on its business in the ordinary course of business
consistent with its past practices. The Company has good and marketable title
free and clear of all Liens to all of the material properties and assets, real
and personal, reflected on the consolidated statement of financial condition of
the Company as of March 31, 2002 included in the Company's SEC Documents or

Company's SEC Documents. All real and personal property which is material to the
Company's business on a consolidated basis and leased or licensed by the Company
or a Subsidiary of the Company is held pursuant to leases or licenses which are
valid and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms and such leases
will not terminate or lapse prior to the Effective Time.

Company owns or possesses valid and binding licenses and other rights to use
without payment of any material amount all material patents, copyrights, trade
secrets, trade names, service marks and trademarks used in its businesses, all
of which have been Previously Disclosed by the Company, and none of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of conflict with respect
thereto that asserts the right of others. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have performed in all material respects all the obligations
required to be performed by them and are not in default under any contract,
agreement, arrangement or commitment relating to any of the foregoing.

         (u) Fiduciary Accounts. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including
but not limited to accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian,
personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in
accordance with the terms of the governing documents and applicable laws and
regulations. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective directors, officers or employees, has committed any breach of trust
with respect to any fiduciary account and the records for each such fiduciary
account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary
account.

         (v) Books and Records. The books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been fully, properly and accurately maintained in all material
respects, and there are no material inaccuracies or discrepancies of any kind
contained or reflected therein, and they fairly present the financial position
of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

         (w) Insurance. The Company has Previously Disclosed all of the material
insurance policies, binders, or bonds currently maintained by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries ("Insurance Policies"). The Company and its Subsidiaries are
insured with reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as the
management of the Company reasonably has determined to be prudent in accordance
with industry practices. All the Insurance Policies are in full force and
effect; the Company and its Subsidiaries are not in material default thereunder;
and all claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion.

         (x) Allowance For Loan Losses. The Company's allowance for loan losses
is, and shall be as of the Effective Date, in compliance with the Company's
existing methodology for determining the adequacy of its allowance for loan
losses as well as the standards established by applicable Governmental
Authorities and the Financial Accounting Standards Board and is and shall be
adequate under all such standards.

         (y) Transactions With Affiliates. All "covered transactions" between a
Company Bank and an "affiliate" within the meaning of Sections 23A and 23B of
the Federal Reserve Act have been in compliance with such provisions.

         (z) Required Vote; Antitakeover Provisions; Company Rights Agreement.

                  (i) The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
         issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is necessary to
         approve this Agreement and the Transactions on behalf of the Company.
         No other vote of the shareholders of the


                                       32
<PAGE>


         Company is required by law, the Company Articles, the Company Bylaws or

         statute or regulation is applicable to this Agreement or the
         Transactions.

                  (iii) The Company has taken all necessary action so that the
         entering into of this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement and
         consummation of the Transactions do not and will not result in the
         grant of any additional rights to any Person under the Company Rights
         Agreement or enable or require the Company Rights issuable thereunder
         to be exercised, and to otherwise ensure that none of Parent or any of
         its affiliates is or becomes an Acquiring Person (as such term is
         defined in the Company Rights Agreement) by reason of the execution of
         this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement or consummation of the
         Transactions, and that a Distribution Date (as such term is defined in
         the Company Rights Agreement) does not occur by reason of the execution
         of this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement or consummation of the
         Transactions. The Company has adopted an amendment to the Company
         Rights Agreement in the form of Annex B hereto.

         (aa) Fairness Opinion. The Company Board has received the written
opinion of RBC Dain Rausher Inc., a member company of RBC Capital Markets, to
the effect that as of the date hereof the Merger Consideration is fair to the
holders of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view.

         (bb) Transactions in Securities. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
of the Company has purchased or sold, or caused to be purchased or sold, any

Act.

         (cc) Disclosure. The representations and warranties contained in this
Section 5.03, when considered as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements and information contained in this Section 5.03 not misleading.

         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
         to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
         the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
         misleading, except that information as of a later date shall be deemed
         to modify information as of an earlier date; and each of the balance
         sheets contained in or incorporated by reference into any such SEC
         Document (including the related notes and schedules thereto) fairly
         presents, or will fairly present, the financial position of Parent and

that would give rise to any valid claim against any party hereto for a brokerage
commission, finder's fee or other like payment with respect to the Transactions.

         statutes, regulations or ordinances which such Governmental Authority
         enforces or (B) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or

efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under
applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the Transactions, including
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, and shall
cooperate fully with the other party hereto to that end.

         6.02. Shareholder Approval. The Company agrees to take, in accordance
with applicable law and the Company Articles and Company Bylaws, all action
necessary to convene as soon as reasonably practicable a special meeting of its
shareholders to consider and vote upon the approval of this Agreement and any
other matters required to be approved by the Company's shareholders for
consummation of the Transactions (including any adjournment or postponement, the
"Company Meeting"). Except with the prior approval of Parent, no other matters
shall be submitted for the approval of the Company shareholders at the Company
Meeting. The Company Board shall at all times prior to and during such meeting
recommend such approval and shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit
such approval by its shareholders; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall
prevent the Company Board from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying
its recommendation if the Company Board determines, after consultation with its
outside counsel, that such action is legally required in order for the directors
to comply with their fiduciary duties to the Company shareholders under
applicable law; provided, further, that Section 6.08 shall govern the
withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying of such recommendation in the
circumstances described therein.

         6.03. Registration Statement.

         (a) Parent agrees to prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 or
other applicable form (the "Registration Statement") to be filed by Parent with
the SEC in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger
(including the proxy statement and prospectus and other proxy solicitation
materials of the Company constituting a part thereof (the "Proxy Statement") and
all related documents). The Company shall prepare and furnish such information
relating to it and its directors, officers and shareholders as may be reasonably
required in connection with the above referenced documents based on its
knowledge of and access to the information required for said documents, and the
Company, and its legal, financial and accounting advisors, shall have the right
to review in advance such Registration Statement


                                       38
<PAGE>


prior to its filing. The Company agrees to cooperate with Parent and Parent's
counsel and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate opinions,
consents and letters from its financial advisor and independent auditor in
connection with the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. Provided
that the Company has cooperated as described above, Parent agrees to file, or
cause to be filed, the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement with the
SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of the Company and Parent agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the filing thereof. Parent also agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits
and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. After the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act, the Company shall promptly mail at its expense the Proxy
Statement to its shareholders.

         (b) Each of the Company and Parent agrees that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
(i) the Registration Statement shall, at the time the Registration Statement and
each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement and any amendment
or supplement thereto shall, at the date(s) of mailing to shareholders and at
the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading. Each of the Company and Parent
further agrees that if such party shall become aware prior to the Effective Date
of any information furnished by such party that would cause any of the
statements in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement to be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to
promptly inform the other parties thereof and to take the necessary steps to
correct the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement.

         (c) Parent agrees to advise the Company, promptly after Parent receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective
or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order
or the suspension of the qualification of Parent Common Stock for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or, to the extent Parent is aware
thereof, threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the
SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for
additional information.

         6.04. Regulatory Filings.

         (a) Each of Parent and the Company and their respective Subsidiaries
shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all
documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities
necessary to consummate the Transactions and any other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the consolidation of any Company branches with
Parent Bank branches or the closure of any Company branches, in each case as
Parent in its sole discretion shall deem necessary; provided, however, that in
no event shall such branch closures or consolidations be deemed a condition to
Parent's obligation hereunder to consummate the


                                       39
<PAGE>


Merger) and the Bank Merger Agreement; and any initial filings with Governmental
Authorities shall be made by Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after the
execution hereof. Each of Parent and the Company shall have the right to review
in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult with the other, in
each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
with respect to all written information submitted to any third party or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. In exercising the
foregoing right, each of such parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it shall consult with the other
parties hereto with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents,
approvals, waivers and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the Transactions, and each
party shall keep the other parties apprised of the status of material matters
relating to completion of the Transactions.

         (b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other parties with
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
such other parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party or
Governmental Authority.

         6.05. Press Releases. The Company and Parent shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release with respect to the Transactions or this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statements without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior
consent of the other party (but after such consultation, to the extent
practicable in the circumstances), issue such press release or make such public
statements as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by law or the
rules or regulations of Nasdaq. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to
develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate management
available at presentations related to the Transactions as reasonably requested
by the other party.

         6.06. Access; Information.

         (a) The Company agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford Parent
and Parent's officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives such access during normal business hours throughout the period
prior to the Effective Time to the books, records (including, without
limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties and
personnel of the Company and the Company Bank and to such other information
relating to the Company or the Company Bank as Parent may reasonably request
and, during such period, it shall furnish promptly to Parent all information
concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company and the Company
Bank as Parent may reasonably request.

         (b) Parent agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable
laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford the Company and
its authorized representatives such access to Parent's personnel as the Company
may reasonably request.

         (c) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause its
representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section
6.06 (as well as any other information obtained


                                       40
<PAGE>


prior to the date hereof in connection with the entering into of this Agreement)
for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions. Subject to
the requirements of law, each party shall keep confidential, and shall cause its
representatives to keep confidential, all information and documents obtained
pursuant to this Section 6.06 (as well as any other information obtained prior
to the date hereof in connection with the entering into of this Agreement)
unless such information (i) was already known to such party, (ii) becomes
available to such party from other sources not known by such party to be bound
by a confidentiality obligation, (iii) is disclosed with the prior written
approval of the party to which such information pertains or (iv) is or becomes
readily ascertainable from publicly available sources. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated or the Transactions shall otherwise fail to be
consummated, each party shall promptly cause all copies of documents or extracts
thereof containing information and data as to another party hereto to be
returned to the party which furnished the same. No investigation by any party of
the business and affairs of any other party shall affect or be deemed to modify
or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement,
or the conditions to any party's obligation to consummate the Transactions.

         6.07. Affiliates. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
identify those persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the Company
within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act
(the "Company Affiliates") and to cause each person so identified to deliver to
Parent as soon as practicable, and in any event prior to the date of the Company
Meeting, a written agreement to comply with the requirements of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act in connection with the sale or other transfer of Parent
Common Stock received in the Merger, which agreement shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

         6.08. Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and each such Subsidiary's directors, officers, employees,
agents and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit,
encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or
offer with respect to a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or
similar transaction involving, or any purchase of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company or more than 10% of the outstanding equity securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (any such proposal or offer being
hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal"). The Company further
agrees that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it
shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and each such
Subsidiary's directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or
attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company
Board from (A) complying with its disclosure obligations under federal or state
law; (B) providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person who
has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Company
Board receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement; (C) engaging in any negotiations or discussions with
any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal or
(D) recommending such an Acquisition Proposal to the shareholders of


                                       41
<PAGE>


the Company, if and only to the extent that, in each such case referred to in
clause (B), (C) or (D) above, (i) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that such action would be
required in order for its directors to comply with their respective fiduciary
duties under applicable law and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal,
if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making
the proposal and would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable
to the Company's shareholders from a financial point of view than the Merger. An
Acquisition Proposal which is received and considered by the Company in
compliance with this Section 6.08 and which meets the requirements set forth in
clause (D) of the preceding sentence is herein referred to as a "Superior
Proposal." The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposals. The Company
agrees that it will notify Parent if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are
received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of
its representatives as soon as the Company becomes aware of the same.

         6.09. Certain Policies. Prior to the Effective Date, each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and
regulations of the SEC and applicable banking laws and regulations, modify or
change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate
valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of
reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of Parent;
provided, however, that no such modifications or changes need be made prior to
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b); and further
provided that in any event, no accrual or reserve made by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.09 shall constitute or be deemed to
be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise
be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to
satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any such adjustments shall not be
deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or
information and shall not be construed as concurrence of the Company or its
management with any such adjustments.

         6.10. Nasdaq Listing. Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to list, prior to the Effective Date, on the Nasdaq the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger.

         6.11. Indemnification.

         (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent (the "Indemnifying
Party") shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director,
officer and employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as applicable,
determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to


                                       42
<PAGE>


the fact that he or she was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee,
fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, including without limitation matters related to the
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or consummation of the
Transactions, to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would be
entitled under the Company Articles and Company Bylaws or equivalent documents
of any Company Subsidiary, as applicable, or any agreement, arrangement or
understanding which has been Previously Disclosed by the Company pursuant to
this Section, in each case as in effect on the date hereof. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent also agrees that limitations on liability existing in favor of
the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company Articles and Company Bylaws
or similar governing documents of the Company Subsidiaries as in effect on the
date hereof with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time shall
survive the Merger and the Bank Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect from and after the Effective Time.

         (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section 6.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure to
so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have
to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice the
Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the
Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as statements
therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii)
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii)
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no
obligation hereunder in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable
laws and regulations.

         (c) The Company shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement
(the "D & O Tail Coverage") under the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance (the "D&O Insurance") which covers persons who are
currently covered by the Company's D&O Insurance that shall provide such
directors and officers with coverage for a period of six years after the
Effective Time on terms no less favorable than those in effect on the date
hereof and at the Effective Time shall provide evidence of such D & O Tail
Coverage to Parent; provided, however, that (i) the Company shall obtain such D
& O Tail Coverage through an insurance brokerage subsidiary of Parent if such
coverage is reasonably acceptable to the Company, (ii) the Company may
substitute for its existing coverage a policy or policies providing
substantially comparable coverage and containing terms and conditions no less
favorable than those in effect on the date hereof if necessary or advisable to
obtain such


                                       43
<PAGE>


extension of coverage and (iii) the aggregate cost of obtaining such extension
of coverage shall not exceed $150,000.

         (d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

         6.12 Benefit Plans.

         (a) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall take all reasonable action so that employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in each employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement of Parent of general applicability (the "Parent Benefits
Plans") to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of the employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries in the Parent Benefits Plans may occur at different times
with respect to different plans), provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to make any grants to any
former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries under any discretionary
equity compensation plan of Parent. Parent shall cause each Parent Benefits Plan
in which employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are eligible to
participate to recognize, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate
in, the vesting of benefits and for all other purposes (but not for accrual of
pension benefits) under the Parent Benefit Plans, the service of such employees
with the Company and its Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was
credited for such purpose by the Company, provided, however, that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. Nothing herein shall limit the ability of Parent to
amend or terminate any of the Company's Benefits Plans in accordance with their
terms at any time.

         (b) At and following the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and the
Surviving Corporation shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance
with their terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current
and former employees of the Company existing as of the Effective Date, as well
as all employment, severance, deferred compensation, split dollar, supplemental
retirement or "change-in-control" agreements, plans or policies of the Company
which are Previously Disclosed. Parent acknowledges that the consummation of the
Merger will constitute a "change-in-control" of the Company for purposes of any
employee benefit plans, agreements and arrangements of the Company.

         (c) If employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries become
eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of Parent, Parent
shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to
the extent such conditions covered under the applicable medical, health or
dental plans of Parent, (ii) provide full credit for under such plans any
deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and
their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee on
or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had


                                       44
<PAGE>


satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Plan prior to
the Effective Time.

         (d) For a period of six months following the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries whose employment
was terminated other than for cause, disability or retirement at or following
the Effective Time, and who so desires, job counseling and outplacement
assistance services in accordance with Parent's employment policies and
practices, shall assist such employees in locating new employment and shall
notify all such employees who want to be so notified of opportunities for
positions with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for which Parent reasonably
believes such persons are qualified and shall consider any application for such
positions submitted by such persons, provided, however, that any decision to
offer employment to any such person shall be made in the sole discretion of
Parent.

         (e) All employees of the Company or a Company Subsidiary as of the
Effective Time shall become employees of Parent or a Parent Subsidiary as of the
Effective Time, and Parent or a Parent Subsidiary will use its reasonable best
efforts to give such persons (other than any such person who is party to an
employment agreement, a severance agreement or a special termination agreement)
at least four weeks prior written notice of any job elimination after the
Effective Time for a period of 90 days following the Effective Time. Subject to
such four-week notice requirement, Parent or a Parent Subsidiary shall have no
obligation to continue the employment of any such person and nothing contained
herein shall give any employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary the right
to continue employment with Parent or a Parent Subsidiary after the Effective
Time. An employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary (other than an employee
who is party to an employment agreement, a severance agreement or a special
termination agreement) whose employment is involuntarily terminated other than
for cause following the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive severance
payments in accordance with, and to the extent provided in, the Parent employee
severance plan with respect to the Transactions, a copy of which the Company
acknowledges has been provided to it by Parent.

         6.13. Bank Merger. Parent and the Company agree to take all action
necessary and appropriate, including causing the entering into of an appropriate
merger agreement (the "Bank Merger Agreement"), to cause the Company Bank to
merge with and into the Parent Bank (the "Bank Merger") in accordance with
applicable laws and regulations and the terms of the Bank Merger Agreement and
as soon as practicable after consummation of the Merger.

         6.14. Coordination of Dividends. After the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall coordinate the declaration of any dividends in respect of the
Company Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto
with that of the Parent Common Stock, it being the intention of the parties that
the holders of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall not receive
more than one dividend, or fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar
quarter with respect to their shares of Parent Common Stock and/or Company
Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock any holder of Company Common
Stock receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.


                                       45
<PAGE>


         6.15. Advisory Board. Upon consummation of the Transactions, Parent
shall cause Parent Bank to appoint one current director of the Company, selected
by Parent in consultation with the Company, to the Massachusetts-based board of
advisory directors of Parent Bank, who shall be eligible to receive compensation
for services in his or her capacity as such in accordance with the policies of
Parent Bank in effect from time to time.

         6.16. Notification of Certain Matters. Each of the Company and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known
to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                    CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER

         7.01. Conditions to Each Party's Obligation to Effect the Merger. The
respective obligation of each of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger is
subject to the fulfillment or, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
written waiver by the parties hereto prior to the Closing Date of each of the
following conditions:

         (a) Shareholder Approval. This Agreement shall have been duly approved
by the requisite vote of the holders of outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock.

         (b) Regulatory Approvals. All regulatory approvals required to
consummate the Transactions shall have been obtained and shall remain in full
force and effect and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof shall have
expired and no such approvals shall contain any conditions, restrictions or
requirements which the Parent Board reasonably determines in good faith would,
individually or in the aggregate, materially reduce the benefits of the
Transactions to such a degree that Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement had such conditions, restrictions or requirements been known at the
date hereof.

         (c) No Injunction. No Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, rule,
regulation, judgment, decree, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) which is in effect and prohibits consummation of the
Transactions.

         (d) Registration Statement. The Registration Statement shall have
become effective under the Securities Act and no stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no
proceedings for that purpose shall have been initiated by the SEC and not
withdrawn.

         (e) Listing. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger shall have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq.


                                       46
<PAGE>


         (f) Tax Opinion. Each of Parent and the Company shall have received the
written opinion of Elias, Matz, Tiernan & Herrick L.L.P., in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to both the Company and Parent, dated as of the
Effective Date, substantially to the effect that, on the basis of the facts,
representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion which are consistent
with the state of facts existing at the Effective Time, the Merger will be
treated for Federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, such counsel may
require and rely upon representations and covenants, including those contained
in certificates of officers of Parent, the Company and others, reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel. In the event that each of
Parent and the Company shall not have received such written opinion from Elias,
Matz, Tiernan & Herrick, L.L.P., as provided above, then in such case this
condition to closing will be deemed satisfied if each of Parent and the Company
shall have received the foregoing written opinion from Goodwin Procter LLP
subject to the foregoing requirements as to form and substance.

         7.02. Conditions to Obligation of the Company. The obligation of the
Company to consummate the Merger is also subject to the fulfillment or written
waiver by the Company prior to the Closing Date of each of the following
conditions:

         (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties
of Parent set forth in this Agreement, subject in all cases to the standard set
forth in Section 5.02, shall be true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Effective Date as though made on and as of the Effective
Date (except that representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of
the date of this Agreement or some other date shall be true and correct as of
such date), and the Company shall have received a certificate, dated the
Effective Date, signed on behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive Officer and
the Chief Financial Officer of Parent to such effect.

         (b) Performance of Obligations of Parent. Parent shall have performed
in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under
this Agreement at or prior to the Effective Time, and the Company shall have
received a certificate, dated the Effective Date, signed on behalf of Parent by

                                   TERMINATION

         8.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the

         (b) Breach. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by Parent or the
Company if its Board of Directors so determines by vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board, in the event of: (i) a breach by Parent or the

<PAGE>


failure of the Merger then to be consummated arises out of or results from the
knowing action or inaction of (i) the party seeking to terminate pursuant to
this Section 8.01(c) or (ii) any of the Shareholders (if the Company is the
party seeking to terminate), which action or inaction is in violation of its
obligations under this Agreement or, in the case of the Shareholders, his, her
or its obligations under the relevant Shareholder Agreement.

         (d) No Regulatory Approval. By the Company or Parent, if its Board of
Directors so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire
Board, in the event the approval of any Governmental Authority required for
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall have been denied by final nonappealable action of such
Governmental Authority or an application therefor shall have been permanently
withdrawn at the request of a Governmental Authority.

         (e) No Shareholder Approval. By either Parent or the Company if any
approval of the shareholders of the Company contemplated by this Agreement shall
not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at
the Company Meeting.

Parent if (i) the Company shall have breached Section 6.08, (ii) the Company
Board shall have failed to make its recommendation referred to in Section 6.02,
withdrawn such recommendation or modified or changed such recommendation in a
manner adverse in any respect to the interests of Parent or (iii) the Company
shall have materially breached its obligations under Section 6.02 by failing to
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Meeting in accordance with
Section 6.02.

         (g) Superior Proposal. At any time prior to the Company Meeting, by the
Company in order to concurrently enter into an acquisition agreement or similar
agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") with respect to a Superior Proposal

be terminated by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.01(g) only after the
fifth Business Day following the Company's provision of written notice to Parent
advising Parent that the Company Board is prepared to accept a Superior
Proposal, and only if, during such five-Business Day period, if Parent so elects
in its sole discretion, the Company and its advisors shall have negotiated in
good faith with Parent to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement as would enable Parent and the Company to proceed with the
Transactions on such adjusted terms.

         8.02. Effect of Termination and Abandonment.

         (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment
of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, no party to this Agreement shall
have any liability or further obligation to any other party hereunder except (i)
as set forth in this Section 8.02 and Section 9.01 and (ii) that termination
will not relieve a breaching party from liability for any willful breach of any
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty of this Agreement giving rise to
such termination.


                                       49

         (b) The Company shall pay Parent the sum of $5.0 million (the
"Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated as follows:

                  (i) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
         Section 8.01(f) or by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(g), in
         either of which case payment shall be made to Parent concurrently with
         the termination of this Agreement; or

                  (ii) if (x) this Agreement is terminated by (A) Parent
         pursuant to Section 8.01(b) or (B) by either Parent or the Company
         pursuant to Section 8.01(e) and in the case of any termination pursuant
         to clause (A) or (B) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
         announced or otherwise communicated or made known to the Company Board
         (or any Person shall have publicly announced, communicated or made
         known an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition
         Proposal) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
         taking of the vote of the shareholders of the Company contemplated by
         this Agreement at the Company Meeting, in the case of clause (B), or
         the date of termination, in the case of clause (A), and (y) within 18
         months after such termination the Company or a Subsidiary of the
         Company enters into an agreement with respect to an Acquisition
         Proposal or consummates a transaction which is the subject of an
         Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent the
         Termination Fee on the date of execution of such agreement or
         consummation of a transaction which is the subject of an Acquisition
         Proposal, provided that if the date of execution of such agreement is
         after 12 months but within 18 months after such termination of this
         Agreement, the Termination Fee shall be payable by the Company to
         Parent only upon consummation of a transaction which is the subject of
         an Acquisition Proposal, regardless whether such consummation occurs
         within 18 months after termination of this Agreement.

Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this Section 8.02(b) shall be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent.

         (c) The Company and Parent agree that the agreement contained in
paragraph (b) of this Section 8.02 is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreement Parent would not
have entered into this Agreement and that such amounts do not constitute a
penalty or liquidated damages in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the
Company. If the Company fails to pay Parent the amounts due under paragraph (b)
above within the time periods specified therein, the Company shall pay the costs
and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent
in connection with any action in which Parent prevails, including the filing of
any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on
the amount of any such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing
during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a
daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date
of actual payment.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         9.01. Survival. No representations, warranties, agreements and
covenants contained in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time (other
than agreements or covenants contained herein that by their express terms are to
be performed after the Effective Time) or the termination of this Agreement if
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time (other than Sections
6.06(c), 8.02 and, excepting Section 9.12 hereof, this Article IX, which shall
survive any such termination). Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
contrary, no representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be terminated or extinguished so as to deprive
a party hereto or any of its affiliates of any defense at law or in equity which
otherwise would be available against the claims of any Person, including without
limitation any shareholder or former shareholder.

         9.02. Waiver; Amendment. Prior to the Effective Time, any provision of
this Agreement may be (i) waived by the party benefited by the provision or (ii)
amended or modified at any time, by an agreement in writing among the parties
hereto executed in the same manner as this Agreement, except that after the
Company Meeting no amendment shall be made which by law requires further
approval by the shareholders of the Company without obtaining such approval.

         9.03. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original.

         9.04. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maine applicable to
contracts made and to be performed entirely within such State.

         9.05 Expenses. Each party hereto will bear all expenses incurred by it
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, accountants and
counsel and, in the case of Parent, the registration fee to be paid to the SEC
in connection with the Registration Statement, except that expenses of printing
the Proxy Statement shall be shared equally between the Company and Parent, and
provided further that nothing contained herein shall limit either party's rights
to recover any liabilities or damages arising out of the other party's willful
breach of any provision of this Agreement.

         9.06. Notices. All notices, requests and other communications hereunder
to a party shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if personally
delivered, telecopied (with confirmation) or mailed by registered or certified
mail (return receipt requested) to such party at its address set forth below or
such other address as such party may specify by notice to the parties hereto.

         9.07. Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement and the Shareholder Agreements represent the entire understanding of
the parties hereto and thereto with reference to the Transactions, and this
Agreement and the Shareholder Agreements supersede any and all other oral or
written agreements heretofore made. Except for the Indemnified Parties' right to
enforce Parent's obligation under Section 6.11, which are expressly intended to
be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified
Party and his or


                                       52
<PAGE>


her heirs and representatives, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied,
is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto or their
respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or
by reason of this Agreement.

         9.08. Severability. Except to the extent that application of this
Section 9.08 would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent, any
term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable
the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity
or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable. In all such cases, the parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practicable, implements the original purposes and intents of this Agreement.

         9.09. Enforcement of the Agreement. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United
States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

         9.10. Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or
Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and are not part of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." Whenever the words "as of the date
hereof" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to mean the day and
year first above written (August 8, 2002).

         9.11. Assignment. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

         9.12. Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent may at any time modify the structure of the
acquisition of the Company set forth herein, subject to the prior written
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, provided that (i) the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of
Company Common Stock is not thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount as a
result of such modification, (ii) such modification will not adversely affect
the tax treatment of the Company's shareholders as a result of receiving the
Merger Consideration and (iii) such modification will not materially delay or
jeopardize receipt of any required approvals of Governmental Authorities.

                              SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT

         SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of August 8, 2002, by
and between _________, a shareholder ("Shareholder") of Warren Bancorp, Inc., a
Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), and Banknorth Group, Inc., a Maine
corporation ("Parent"). All terms used herein and not defined herein shall have
the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement (defined below).

         WHEREAS, Parent and the Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to
which the Company will merge with and into Parent on the terms and conditions
set forth therein (the "Merger") and, in connection therewith, outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock will be converted into shares of Parent Common
Stock and/or cash in the manner set forth therein; and

         WHEREAS, Shareholder owns the shares of Company Common Stock identified
on Annex I hereto (such shares, together with all shares of Company Common Stock
subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this Agreement, being
referred to as the "Shares"); and

         WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement,
Shareholder, solely in such Shareholder's capacity as a shareholder of the
Company and not in any other capacity, has agreed to enter into and perform this
Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt,
sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

                  1. Agreement to Vote Shares. Shareholder agrees that at any
         meeting of the shareholders of the Company, or in connection with any
         written consent of the shareholders of the Company, Shareholder shall:

                  (i) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares
         to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum;
         and

                  (ii) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, or
         deliver a written consent (or cause a consent to be delivered)
         covering, all the Shares (whether acquired heretofore or hereafter)
         that are beneficially owned by Shareholder or as to which Shareholder
         has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct the voting,
         (x) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the
         Merger; (y) against any action or agreement that would result in a
         breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
         obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger
         Agreement or of Shareholder contained in this Agreement; and (z)
         against any Acquisition Proposal or any other action, agreement or
         transaction that is intended, or could reasonably be

<PAGE>


         expected, to materially impede, interfere or be inconsistent with,
         delay, postpone, discourage or materially and adversely affect
         consummation of the Merger or this Agreement.

                  2. No Transfers Prior to the Company Meeting (as defined in
         the Merger Agreement), Shareholder agrees not to, directly or
         indirectly, sell transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of, or
         enter into any contract option, commitment or other arrangement or
         understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or
         other disposition of, any of the Shares if such sale, transfer, pledge,
         assignment or disposition could occur prior to the Company Meeting. In
         the case of any transfer by operation of law, this Agreement shall be
         binding upon and inure to the transferee(s). Any transfer or other
         disposition in violation of the terms of this Section 2 shall be null
         and void.

                  3. Representations and Warranties of Shareholder. Shareholder
         represents and warrants to and agrees with Parent as follows:

                           A. Capacity. Shareholder has all requisite capacity
                  and authority to enter into and perform his, her or its
                  obligations under this Agreement.

                           B. Binding Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the
                  valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder, subject
                  to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
                  reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
                  applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and
                  to general equity principles.

                           C. Non-Contravention. The execution and delivery of
                  this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the performance by
                  Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and the
                  consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated
                  hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a
                  default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other
                  obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree
                  to which Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder is
                  bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which Shareholder
                  is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is a corporation,
                  partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or
                  other organizational document of Shareholder.

                           D. Ownership of Shares. Shareholder has good title to
                  all of the Shares as of the date hereof, and, except as set
                  forth on Annex I hereto, the Shares are so owned free and
                  clear of any liens, security interests, charges or other
                  encumbrances.

                  4. Specific Performance and Remedies. Shareholder acknowledges
         that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to Parent if
         Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this
         Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, Parent will not
         have an adequate remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder
         agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to
         remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such
         failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis
         that Parent has an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees


                                      2
<PAGE>


         that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement
         for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with Parent's
         seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In addition, after
         discussing the matter with Shareholder, Parent shall have the right to
         inform any third party that Parent reasonably believes to be, or to be
         contemplating, participating with Shareholder or receiving from
         Shareholder assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of
         this Agreement and of the rights of Parent hereunder, and that
         participation by any such persons with Shareholder in activities in
         violation of Shareholder's agreement with Parent set forth in this
         Agreement may give rise to claims by Parent against such third party.

                  5.  Term of Agreement; Termination.

                  A. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date
         hereof.

                  B. This Agreement shall terminate upon the date, if any, of
         termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. Upon
         such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or
         liabilities hereunder; provided, however, such termination shall not
         relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this
         Agreement prior to such termination.

                  C. If the Merger Agreement is not terminated in accordance
         with its terms, this Agreement (except for the provisions of Sections 3
         and 8, which shall survive the Effective Time) shall terminate upon the
         Effective Time. Upon such termination, no party shall have any further
         obligations or liabilities under this Agreement; provided, however,
         such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any
         willful breach of such Section prior to such termination.

                  6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior
         agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to
         the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the
         parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may
         not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may
         be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by
         each party hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by either party
         shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by any such
         party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any
         provision hereof by such party.

                  7. Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands or other
         communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given
         when delivered personally, upon receipt of a transmission confirmation
         if sent by telecopy or like transmission and on the next business day
         when sent by a reputable overnight courier service to the parties at

                  Parent or any other Person shall be deemed to be an Acquiring

                  thereby (except as otherwise provided herein) in whole or in

                  transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement shall not be
                  deemed to be a Section 11(a)(ii) Event and shall not cause the
                  Rights to be adjusted or exercisable in accordance with, or
                  any other action to be taken or obligation to arise pursuant
                  to, this Section 11(a)(ii)."

                  the consummation of the Merger and (iii) the consummation of
                  the other transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement
                  shall not be deemed to be a Section 13 Event and shall not
                  cause the Rights to be adjusted or exercisable in accordance
                  with, or any other action to be taken or obligation to arise
                  pursuant to, this Section 13."

        6. Effectiveness. This Amendment shall be deemed effective as of the
date first above written, as if executed on such date. Except as expressly set
forth herein, this Amendment shall not by implication or otherwise alter,
modify, amend or in any way affect any of the terms, conditions, obligations,
covenants or agreements contained in the Rights Agreement, all of which are
ratified and affirmed in all respects and shall continue in full force and
effect and shall be otherwise unaffected.

         7. Governing Law. This Amendment shall be deemed to be a contract made
under the laws of the State of Massachusetts and for all purposes shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of such state applicable
to contracts to be made and performed entirely within such state.

         8. Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed an original, and
all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
