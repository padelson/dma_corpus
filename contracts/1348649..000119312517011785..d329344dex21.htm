This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of January
17, 2017, is among Eli Lilly and Company, an Indiana corporation (" _Parent_
"), ProCar Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in _Exhibit A_ attached
hereto.

 

RECITALS

A. The boards of directors (" _Board of Directors_ ") of Parent and Merger
Sub have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

B. The special committee of the Company Board (the " _Special Committee_ ")
has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, are fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders; (ii) approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; (iii)
approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer and
the Merger; (iv) resolved that this Agreement and the Merger shall be governed
by and effected under Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "); and (v) resolved to recommend that the
Company Board approve this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer
and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 

C. The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, are fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders; (ii) approved and declared advisable
this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; (iii)
approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer and
the Merger; (iv) resolved that this Agreement and the Merger shall be governed
by and effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL; and (v) resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender
their Shares pursuant to the Offer.

D. Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will vote to adopt this
Agreement and approve the Merger as contemplated by the DGCL immediately after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 

E. In furtherance of such acquisition, Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub
to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as
permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ ") that are issued and outstanding (each such 

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 1  share of Company Common Stock, a " _Share_ " and, collectively, the "
_Shares_ "), at a price per Share of $46.50 (such amount, or any higher amount
per Share paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the "
_Offer Price_ ") net to the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

F. As soon as practicable following acceptance for payment of the shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, Merger Sub will be merged with
and into the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement (the " _Merger_ "), with the Merger to be effected pursuant to
Section 251(h) of the DGCL. Each Share that is not tendered and accepted
pursuant to the Offer, other than certain Shares as provided in _Section
2.5(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, will thereupon be cancelled and converted in
the Merger into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer
Price on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

G. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter
into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are executing and
delivering Tender and Support Agreements in favor of Parent and Merger Sub
(the " _Tender and Support Agreements_ "), pursuant to which those
stockholders, among other things, will agree to tender all Shares beneficially
owned by them to Merger Sub in the Offer.

 

AGREEMENT

In consideration of the foregoing and of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

THE OFFER 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, and provided further that the Company is prepared
(in accordance with _Section_ _1.2(b)_ ) to file with the SEC, and to
disseminate to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the Schedule 14D-9
on the same date as Merger Sub commences the Offer, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (and in any event no later than the tenth
Business Day after the date of this Agreement), Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 of the
Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding Shares at the Offer
Price, net to the seller in cash, without interest. The obligation of Merger
Sub to accept for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in  _Annex_ __ _ A_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "), and no other
conditions. The Offer Price payable for each Share validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the holder of
the Share in cash, without interest, on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in the Offer.

 





     |  |

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 2 (b) Merger Sub, or Parent on behalf of Merger Sub, expressly reserves the
right to waive, in its sole discretion, in whole or in part, any of the Offer
Conditions and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer;
provided that, unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or previously
approved by the Company in writing (which approval may be granted or withheld
by the Company in its sole discretion), Merger Sub, and Parent on behalf of
Merger Sub, shall not, subject to applicable Law: (i) decrease the Offer
Price; (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer; (iii)
decrease the maximum number of Shares sought in the Offer; (iv) impose
conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions; (v) amend or
modify any of the Offer Conditions in a manner that adversely affects the
holders of Shares; (vi) change or waive the Minimum Tender Condition; (vii)
extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date other than as required or
permitted by this Agreement; or (viii) otherwise amend or modify any terms of
the Offer in a manner that adversely affects the holders of Shares.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless the Offer
is extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall
expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is
20 Business Days following the commencement of the Offer, determined in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act (the "
_Initial Expiration Date_ ," and such date, or such subsequent date to which
the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_,

 



     | (i) | if on any then-scheduled Expiration Date (A) the Minimum
Tender Condition shall not have been satisfied or (B) any of the other Offer
Conditions shall not have been satisfied (and, to the extent permitted under
the terms of this Agreement, shall not have been waived by Parent), then
Merger Sub may, and Parent may cause Merger Sub to, without limiting Merger
Subs and Parents obligations under _clause (ii)_ of this _Section 1.1(c)_
, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up
to five Business Days each (or such longer period as may be agreed by the
Company), up to and including the Outside Date, the length of each such period
to be determined by Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) in its sole
discretion, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | (w) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or NASDAQ applicable to the
Offer; provided that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer to
a date later than the Outside Date; 
---|---|--- 

(x) if on any then-scheduled Expiration Date, any of the Offer Conditions set
forth in _clauses (b)_ through _(i)_ of _Annex A_ is not satisfied (and, to
the extent permitted under the terms of this Agreement, has not been waived by
Parent), but is capable of being satisfied prior to the Outside Date, then,
if requested by the Company, Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) shall extend
the Offer for one or more extension periods of up to five Business Days each
(or for such longer period as may be agreed by the Company), up to and
including the Outside Date, the length of each such period to be determined by
Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) in its sole discretion to permit such
Offer Condition to be satisfied; and

 



 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 3 (y) if on any then-scheduled Expiration Date, the Offer Conditions (other than
the Minimum Tender Condition) have been satisfied (or, to the extent
permitted, have been waived by Parent), but the Minimum Tender Condition has
not been satisfied, then, if requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for one or more extension
periods of at least five Business Days each, up to and including the Outside
Date, the length of each such period to be determined by the Company in its
sole discretion to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied. 

(d) Subject to the foregoing, including the requirements of Rule 14d-11 of the
Exchange Act, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and
pay for all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer promptly after the Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence and subject to the applicable rules of the SEC and the
terms and conditions of the Offer, Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to
delay payment for Shares in order to comply with applicable Laws. Any such
delay in payment shall be effected in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the
Exchange Act.

 

(e) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article 8_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article 8_ , Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, promptly terminate the Offer without accepting any Shares
previously tendered. If the Offer is terminated by Merger Sub, or this
Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Merger
Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of
Merger Sub to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares
to the registered holders thereof.

(f) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger Sub
shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer, which shall contain or incorporate by reference an
offer to purchase reflecting the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including the Offer Conditions, and a form of the letter of transmittal and
summary advertisement and other ancillary documents and instruments, if any,
in respect of the Offer (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein,
together with any amendments or supplements thereto, and including exhibits
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to
(A) comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and
other applicable Laws and (B) not contain any untrue statement of material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to any information contained or
incorporated by reference in any Offer Document that was furnished or provided
by the Company. Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
furnish

 





     |  |

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 4  to Parent and Merger Sub in writing all information concerning the Company
and its stockholders that may be required by applicable Law or reasonably
requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Offer Documents or for
any action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.1_. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and
Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as
so corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer
Documents, as so corrected or supplemented, to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as, and to the extent, required by applicable Law. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger
Sub shall give good faith consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested by the Company or its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent, Merger Sub
or their counsel may receive after the date hereof from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those comments.
The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
any written responses to such SEC comments, and Parent shall give good faith
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents.

 

(g) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Offer Price and the
Merger Consideration shall each be appropriately adjusted to reflect such
change.

Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) The Company shall, promptly after the date hereof and from time to time
thereafter as requested by Parent or its agents, furnish Parent with an
updated list (and, if available, computer files) of its stockholders of
record, non-objecting beneficial owners, the names and addresses of all record
holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock
depositories, in each case as of the most recent practicable date, and shall
provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists (and,
if available, computer files) of stockholders of record, non-objecting
beneficial holders, mailing labels and securities positions) and such
assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably request in connection with
the Offer. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any third parties to,
cooperate with Parent and its agents to disseminate the Offer Documents to
holders of Shares held in or subject to any Stock Plan or other
Employee Benefit Plan, and to permit such holders of Shares to tender Shares
in the Offer.

(b) Concurrently with the filing of the Offer Documents with the SEC on the
day that the Offer is commenced, the Company shall file with the SEC and
disseminate to holders of Shares a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer

exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall reflect the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and, subject to _Section 6.6(d)(ii)_ , the
Company Board Recommendation and shall include a description of the other
Board Actions and a notice of appraisal rights in accordance with Section

material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws and (ii) not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
apply to any information contained or incorporated by reference in the
Schedule 14D-9 that was furnished or provided by Parent or Merger Sub. Each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as, and to the extent, required by applicable Law.
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company
shall give good faith consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested by Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel. The Company shall
provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with copies of any written
comments and shall inform them of any oral comments that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments. Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any
written responses to such SEC comments, and the Company shall give good faith
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested

or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to deposited, with the Paying Agent at or prior to the
Effective Time, the cash necessary to pay for the Shares converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ (the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. The Exchange Fund shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be
invested in Specified Securities by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent;
provided that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable hereunder and Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that
the Exchange Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy Parents
obligation under this Agreement. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the Paying Agent will be
payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs, and no part of such net
profits shall accrue to the benefit of the holders of Shares.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was a holder of record of
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.5_: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form for use in effecting the
surrender of stock certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or uncertificated Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (which transmittal letter
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent);
and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate or a Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, net of applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to
_Section_ _2.7(f)_ , and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall then be cancelled. If payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate(s)
formerly representing Shares are registered in the transfer records of the
Company, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall be
made only to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.
Until surrendered in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, subject to the
rights of holders of Dissenting Shares, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at all times from and after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that
the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of the Shares
previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash
payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article 2_.

accordance with the terms of this _Article 2_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously
represented by such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
the Surviving Corporation shall not permit any further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were

Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article 2_ ,
except as otherwise provided by Law.

(d)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares at any time following the nine-
month anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article 2_ shall thereafter only be entitled
to receive from Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws, as general creditors thereof) payment of
their claim for Merger Consideration. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent
or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to this
Agreement.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent and the
Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts, if any, as Parent,
Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or the Company are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying
Agent or the Company, such amount shall be (i) paid over to the appropriate
Tax Authority; and (ii) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the former holder of the Shares, Options or Restricted Stock
Units, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 25 (f) The Company has complied in all material respects with all applicable
security and privacy standards regarding protected health information under
(i) the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as
amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
Act of 2009, including the regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) any
applicable state or foreign privacy Laws.

Section 3.16 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) _Section 3.16(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete
and accurate list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all of the following
Intellectual Property that is owned or purported to be owned by the Company:
(i) registered Patents and pending applications for Patents, (ii) registered
Trademarks and pending applications for registration of Trademarks, (iii)
Internet domain names, (iv) registered Copyrights and pending applications for
registration of Copyrights (the Intellectual Property referred to in clauses
(i) through (iv), collectively, the " _Company Registered Intellectual
Property_ "), and (v) material unregistered Trademarks (for which there are no
pending applications). Except for matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
a Company Material Adverse Effect, all of the Company Registered Intellectual
Property is subsisting and in full force and effect, and all necessary
registration, maintenance, renewal, and other relevant filing fees due through
the date of this Agreement have been timely paid and all necessary documents
and certificates in connection therewith have been timely filed with the
relevant Patent, Trademark, Copyright, domain name, or other authorities in
the United States or foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the
purpose of maintaining such Company Registered Intellectual Property in full
force and effect.

 

(b) The Company is the sole and exclusive owner of, or has a license,
sublicense or otherwise possesses legally enforceable rights to use
all Intellectual Property used in or necessary for the conduct of the
business of the Company as presently conducted (the " _Company Intellectual
Property_ "), free and clear of all Liens; provided, however, that this
sentence shall not be construed as a representation and warranty of non-
infringement. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the Company has been
granted licenses to Patents owned by a third party, such licenses are
Company Material Contracts, and the Company has made available to Parent
copies of all such licenses, including any amendments thereto. Except as set
forth in _Section 3.16(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, no third party
has any joint ownership interest in any inventions claimed by any issued
Patents or pending claims in any applications for Patents included in the
Company Registered Intellectual Property.

 

(c) The Company has diligently prepared or is diligently preparing to file
Patent applications for all potentially patentable inventions within the
Company Intellectual Property owned or purportedly owned by the Company in a
manner and within a sufficient time period to avoid statutory disqualification
of any potential Patent application, except, where in the exercise of
reasonable business judgment, the Company has decided not to file a Patent
application on a potentially patentable invention. Except for such non-
compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the
Company has complied with all Laws regarding the duty of disclosure, candor
and good faith in connection with each Patent and Patent application included
in the

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 26  Company Registered Intellectual Property. Except as, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, no public disclosure bar has occurred or on-
sale bar has arisen which has had or would reasonably be expected to render
any Patent contained in the Company Registered Intellectual Property
unenforceable or, in the case of any claims of pending Patent applications,
rendering such claims unpatentable.

(d) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the
Knowledge of the Company (i) the conduct of the business of the Company as
presently conducted has not infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated and is not infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any
Intellectual Property rights of any third party, and (ii) no third party has
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated or is infringing,
misappropriating or otherwise violating any of the Company Registered
Intellectual Property or other material Company Intellectual Property owned or
purported to be owned by the Company, and no such claims have been made
against any third party by the Company.

 

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 3.16(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
as of the date of this Agreement, there is no action pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company (other than, for
clarity, office actions), and, the Company has not received any notice from
any Person since January 1, 2014, in each case, pursuant to which any Person
is (i) alleging that the conduct of the business of the Company is infringing,
misappropriating or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property rights of
any third party, or (ii) contesting the use, ownership, validity
or enforceability of any of the Company Intellectual Property owned or
purported to be owned by the Company, except, in the case of _clauses_ __ _
(i)_ and _(ii)_ , as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. None
of the material Company Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned
by the Company is subject in any material respect to any pending or
outstanding injunction, order, judgment, settlement, consent order, ruling or
other disposition of dispute that adversely restricts the use, transfer or
registration of, or adversely affects the validity or enforceability of, any
such Company Intellectual Property.

 

(f) No past or present director, officer or employee of the Company owns (or
has any claim, or any right (whether or not currently exercisable) to any
ownership interest, in or to) any Company Intellectual Property. The Company
has executed valid and enforceable written agreements with each of its past
and present directors, officers, employees, consultants and independent
contractors who are engaged in creating or developing for the Company any
material Company Intellectual Property in the course of such Persons
employment or retention thereby, pursuant to which such Person has (i) agreed
to hold all confidential information of the Company in confidence and (ii)
presently assigned to the Company all of such Persons rights, title and
interest in and to all Intellectual Property created or developed for the
Company in the course of such Persons employment or retention thereby. To
the Knowledge of the Company, there is no material uncured breach by either
party under any such agreement.

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 27 (g) The Company has taken commercially reasonable steps to maintain the
secrecy and confidentiality of all material Trade Secrets included in the
Company Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by the Company.
No Trade Secret that is material to the business of the Company as presently
conducted has been authorized to be disclosed, or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, has been disclosed to any of the Companys past or present employees
or any third person, other than pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement
restricting the disclosure and use of such Trade Secret.

(h) No funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Authority or any
university, college, research institute or other educational institution has
been or is being used in any material respect to create, in whole or in part,
any material Company Intellectual Property, except for any such funding or use
of facilities or personnel that does not result in such Governmental
Authority or educational institution obtaining ownership of, or use rights to,
such Company Intellectual Property, or does not require or otherwise obligate
the Company to grant or offer to any such Governmental Authority or
educational institution any license or other right to such Company
Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the Company, no current or former
employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Company who
contributed to the creation or development of the Company Intellectual
Property has performed services for a Governmental Authority or any
university, college, research institute or other educational institution
related to the Companys business as presently conducted during a period of
time during which such employee, consultant or independent contractor was also
performing services for the Company.

reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the
computer systems, including the software, firmware, hardware, networks,
interfaces, platforms and related systems, owned, leased or licensed by the
Company (collectively, the " _Company Systems_ ") are sufficient for
the conduct of its business as presently conducted; (ii) in the last twelve
months, there have been no failures, breakdowns, continued substandard
performance or other adverse events affecting any such Company Systems that
have caused or could reasonably be expected to result in the substantial
disruption or interruption in or to the use of such Company Systems or the
conduct of the business of the Company; and (iii) to the Knowledge of the
Company, in the past 12 months, there have not been any incidents of
unauthorized access or other security breaches of the Company Systems.

(j) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
of the Transactions will not (i) result in the breach of, or create on behalf
of any third party the right to terminate or modify (x) any agreement relating
to any Company Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by or
exclusively licensed to the Company or (y) any agreement as to which the
Company is a party and pursuant to which the Company is authorized to use any
Intellectual Property of any third party that is material to the business of
the Company as presently conducted, excluding in each case generally
commercially available, off-the-shelf software programs available at a cost
of not more than $50,000 in aggregate; (ii) result in or require the grant,
assignment or transfer to any other Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates) of any license or other right or interest
under, to or in any of the Company Intellectual Property owned or purported to
be owned by or exclusively licensed to the Company or any of the Intellectual
Property of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates; or (iii)
cause a material loss or impairment of any Company Intellectual Property.

employment, including those relating to wages, hours, benefits, labor and the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. Sections 1101 et seq. and
its implementing regulations. The Company is not a party, and is not
otherwise bound by, any consent decree or settlement agreement with any

as contractors or as other service providers can be terminated at any time for
any reason without any amounts being owed to such individuals, other than with
respect to compensation or payments accrued before the notice of termination.
No employee is on disability or other leave of absence, other than short term
absences of less than three weeks. The Company has not sponsored any employee
for, or otherwise knowingly engaged any employee working pursuant to, a non-
immigrant visa.

(d) All individuals who perform services for the Company and who have been
classified as other than employees have been properly classified. All
employees of the Company are employed in the United States, and none of the
written terms and conditions of their employment provide for the application
of the Law of any jurisdiction other than the United States.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 6.1 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates
to, provide to each individual who, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
is a Company Employee, including any individual on an approved leave of
absence (including short-term disability leave) immediately prior to the
Effective Time who continues employment with the Surviving Corporation or
Parent during such one-year period (a " _Continuing Company Employee_ "), (i)
the same salary or hourly wage rate provided to such Continuing Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) the same short-term
(annual or more frequent) target bonus opportunity provided to such Continuing
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) benefits
(excluding equity and equity-based awards and change in control plans,
programs or arrangements) that are substantially comparable to those provided
to such Continuing Company Employee under the benefit plans, programs,
policies, agreements and arrangements of the

 





     |  |

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 40  Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, after the Effective Time, nothing
in this _Section 6.1(a)_ shall preclude the Surviving Corporation from
terminating the employment of any Continuing Company Employee for any lawful
reason.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor all Employee Benefit Plans of the Company
(excluding the Stock Plans and the ESPP to be terminated at or prior to the
Effective Time in accordance herewith), in each case in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time; _provided_ , that
this _Section 6.1(b)_ shall not prevent the amendment or termination of any
specific Employee Benefit Plan or Contract in accordance with the terms
thereof.

(c) For purposes of vesting, participation, eligibility for vacation pay and
level of benefits under the employee benefit plans of Parent providing
benefits to any Continuing Company Employees after the Effective Time (the "
_New Plans_ "), each Continuing Company Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company and its predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Company Employee was
entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits or for purposes of benefit accrual. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Company
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
period, in any and all New Plans except to the extent any waiting period
in effect under the comparable Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time would
not have been satisfied; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits to any
Continuing Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Company Employee
and his or her covered dependents.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall, or be construed so as to (i) modify or
amend any Employee Benefit Plan, New Plan or other agreement, plan, program,
or document or (ii) obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company following the Effective Time) to adopt or maintain any particular plan
or program or other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time or
prevent Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Company following the
Effective Time) from modifying or terminating any such plan, program or other
compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time. Without limiting the
generality of _Section_ __ _ 9.6_, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ shall
be construed as giving any Person (including any Company Employee or dependent
or beneficiary thereof) any right (including any third party beneficiary
right), remedy or claim under or in respect of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or
any other provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.2 _Public Statements_. The parties shall issue a joint press
release, mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent, promptly upon
execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company
agrees that, from and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, the parties shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press
release or making any public statement concerning the Transactions, except as
such release or statement

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 41  may be required by applicable Law, court process or any listing rules of
NASDAQ or other national securities exchanges or trading markets; provided,
however, that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to any
communications regarding either (a) a Takeover Proposal that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside
counsel and financial advisor) is reasonably likely to constitute a Superior
Proposal and that failure to issue such press release or make such public
statement would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; or (b) a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation.

Section 6.3 _Antitrust Law and Other Consents; Further Actions_.

 

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate
the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other Transactions as promptly
as practicable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party
to this Agreement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) make
all filings or obtain as soon as practicable all Consents (if any) required
to be made with or obtained from any Governmental Authority by such party in
connection with the Offer, the Merger, and each of the other Transactions; and
(ii) obtain as soon as practicable each other Consent (if any) of any third
party (including any Governmental Authority) that is required, proper or
advisable to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Law or Contract, or
otherwise) by such party in connection with the Offer, the Merger, and each
of the other Transactions; provided, that in no event will the Company be
obligated to pay prior to the Effective Time any material fee, penalty or
other material consideration to any third party to obtain any consent
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_. The Company and Parent will consult and
cooperate with one another, and will consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with any actions described in this  _Section_ __ _
6.3_.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.3(a)_ , each of Parent and
the Company shall (i) file and not withdraw as promptly as practicable after
the date of this Agreement (but in no event later than the tenth Business Day
after the date hereof) any notification and report forms and related material
required to be filed by it with the Federal Trade Commission and the United
States Department of Justice, as applicable, pursuant to the HSR Act, together
with a request for early termination of the applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act and (ii) as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, make any filings required to be made by it with any Governmental
Authority under any other applicable Laws that are designed or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or significant impediments or lessening
of competition or creation or strengthening of a dominant position through
merger or acquisition (" _Other Antitrust Laws_ " and, together with the HSR
Act, the " _Antitrust Laws_ "), and, in each case, shall promptly make any
further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary.

 

(c) If Parent or the Company (or any of their respective Affiliates) receives
a request for additional information from any Governmental Authority that is
related to the Transactions, then such party shall endeavor in good faith to
make, or cause to be made, after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response to such request. No party shall participate in any
meeting or engage in any material substantive conversation with any
Governmental Authority

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 42  relating to the Transactions without giving the other party prior notice of
the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. Parent shall advise the
Company promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or
written) which Parent proposes to make or enter into with any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted
with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law as promptly as
practicable.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub shall have any obligation to (or to cause any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the Company to): (i) sell, license, divest or
dispose of or hold separate the assets, Intellectual Property or businesses of
any entity; (ii) terminate, amend or assign any existing relationships or
contractual rights or obligations of any entity; (iii) change or modify any
course of conduct regarding future operations of any entity; (iv) otherwise
take any action that would limit the freedom of action with respect to, or the
ability to retain, one or more businesses, assets or rights of any entity or
interests therein; or (v) commit to take any such action in the foregoing
_clauses_ _(i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ or _(iv)_ ; provided, however, that Parent
and Merger Sub shall take the actions in the foregoing _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_
, _(iii)_ or _(iv)_ with respect to the Company (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) if such action (A) is necessary to
avoid the entry or to effect the dissolution of, or vacate or lift, any
Judgment that would otherwise have the effect of preventing, impairing or
delaying the Acceptance Time or the Closing and (B) would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be materially detrimental to the
benefits anticipated to be derived by Parent and its Affiliates as a result of
the Transactions. In addition, the Company shall not offer or commit to take
any of the actions referred to in  _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ or _(iv)_
of the immediately preceding sentence without Parents prior written consent.
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not require the Company to, and the
Company shall not be required to, take any action with respect to any Order
or any applicable Law which would bind the Company prior to the Effective
Time.

 

Section 6.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time (a)
the Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub: (i) of any
notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the Consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions; (ii) of
receipt of any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the Transactions; (iii) of any Action commenced or, to its
Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
the Company that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to any Section of this Agreement or
that relates to the consummation of any of the Transactions; and (iv) upon
becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in
this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure by the
Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case if and
only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably
be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Offer or the Merger to fail to be satisfied; and
(b) Parent shall provide prompt notice to the Company: (i) of any notice or
other communication from any Person alleging that the Consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 43  Transactions and obtaining such consent would (in the good faith
determination of Parent) reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions;
(ii) of any Action commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting Parent that, if pending on the
date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to any Section of this Agreement or that relates to the consummation
of any of the Transactions; (iii) of receipt of any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions; and (iv) upon becoming aware that any representation or
warranty made by it in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of
any failure by Parent to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in
each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure
would reasonably be expected result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.4_ shall not (A) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other
provision of this Agreement or (B) limit the remedies available to the
party receiving such notice; provided, further, that a partys good faith
failure to comply with this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall not provide any other
party the right not to effect the Transactions, except to the extent that
any other provision of this Agreement independently provides such right.

Section 6.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause the
officers, directors, employees and other Representatives of the Company to,
provide the officers, employees, agents and other Representatives of Parent
and Merger Sub reasonable access during normal business hours, to the
officers, employees, Representatives, properties, facilities, books, records,
work papers, correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic
form), contracts and other assets of the Company as Parent shall reasonably
request as long as such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the Companys business, and shall promptly furnish Parent and
Merger Sub (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or
submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities
Laws and a copy of any communication received by the Company from the SEC
concerning compliance with securities laws with respect to matters unrelated
to the Transactions; (ii) at the Closing, a list of filings, payments or
similar actions that must be taken by the Surviving Corporation within 60
days following the Closing Date for the purposes of obtaining, maintaining,
perfecting or renewing any registrations or applications for Company
Registered Intellectual Property; and (iii) all other information concerning
its business, properties and personnel, in each case (A) as Parent through its
officers, employees, agents or other Representatives may reasonably request;
(B) that is in the possession, custody or control of the Company or any of
its Representatives; and (C) the disclosure of which would not (x) violate any
Law or Judgment or any binding confidentiality obligation of the Company or
(y) result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
similar privilege; provided, however, that the Company and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions in clause (C)
above apply. Parent, Merger Sub and their respective officers, employees and
agents will hold any such information that is non-public in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms until the
Effective Time (other than the first sentence of Section 6, Section 8 and
Section 9 thereof, which shall terminate in full and have no further force of
effect upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement), at which time the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate without further
action.

 

Section 6.6 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, except as permitted by _Section 6.6(b)_ ,
the Company shall not, and shall ensure that its directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
agents and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") do not,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, or knowingly encourage or
facilitate (including through the furnishing of any nonpublic information) the
submission or announcement of any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, indication
of interest, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal (a " _Takeover Inquiry_ "); (ii) participate or engage in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information in connection with, or knowingly take any action to facilitate
any inquiry or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry;
(iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Takeover Proposal (or resolve or
publicly propose to do any of the foregoing); or (iv) enter into any
agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent or similar document with
respect to, or any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to, any
Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) or accept any Takeover Proposal (or resolve or
publicly propose to do any of the foregoing). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this _Section 6.6(a)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company, the Company Board or the Special Committee from
stating and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with respect
to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act;
provided, however, that (A) this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall not be deemed to
permit the Company Board or the Special Committee to make a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation except to the extent permitted by _Section 6.6(d)(i)_
and (B) any such communication or disclosure, other than any "stop, look and
listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f), shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Change Recommendation
unless the Company Board and the Special Committee expressly publicly
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that (1) each stockholder of the Company that is a
party to a Tender and Support Agreement and each of such stockholders
directors, officers and employees shall be deemed to be a Representative of
the Company for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ and (2) any action taken
by any Representative of the Company which, if taken by the Company, would be
a breach of the provisions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be
deemed to constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ by the Company.

(b) If at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company or any of its Representatives receives from a
third party an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal that has not
been withdrawn, the Company and its Representatives shall be permitted to
communicate with such third party solely to clarify the

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 45  terms of such Takeover Proposal. In addition, and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in _Section 6.6(a)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, the
Company and its Representatives may (x) enter into and participate in
discussions or negotiations with such third party and its Representatives in
response to such Takeover Proposal and (y) furnish access and nonpublic
information to such third party if and only if: (i) prior to taking any
action contemplated in _clauses (x)_ or _(y)_ above with respect to such
third party, the Company Board or the Special Committee shall have determined
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company
Financial Advisor, that such Takeover Proposal is reasonably likely to
constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take the actions
contemplated in _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ above would be inconsistent with the
Company Boards and the Special Committees fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law; (ii) there shall have been no material
breach or violation of the terms of _Section 6.6(a)_ in connection with such
third party making such Takeover Proposal; and (iii) contemporaneously with
furnishing or making available any information to such third party, the
Company furnishes or makes available such information to Parent (to
the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously furnished or
made available to Parent). Any nonpublic information furnished to such third
party shall be subject to an executed confidentiality agreement in a customary
form that (A) is no less favorable to the Company with respect to
confidentiality than the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) does not prohibit
the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_ or otherwise prohibit the Company from complying with
its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ (" _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ "). During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall (1) promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) advise Parent in writing of the receipt of
any Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry that is made or submitted by any
Person during the Pre-Closing Period, (2) provide to Parent a reasonably
detailed summary of the material terms and conditions thereof (including the
identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry) and
copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Person
relating to such Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry, (3) keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or
negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry (including
any material modifications to the financial or other material terms and
conditions of such Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry) on a prompt basis
(and provide copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of
such Person relating to such Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry) and (4)
upon the request of Parent, reasonably inform Parent of the status of such
Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry.

 

(c) The Company shall and shall ensure that its Representatives immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, discussions
or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent) conducted prior to the
date of this Agreement that relate to any Takeover Proposal or Takeover
Inquiry or any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company with
respect to any Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry. The Company shall also
promptly terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously
granted to any such Person or any of its Representatives and request the
return or destruction of all confidential information provided by or on
behalf of the Company to any such Person or any of its Representatives
promptly after the date of this Agreement.

     | (i) | Subject to _Section 6.6(d)(ii)_ , the Company hereby
consents to the inclusion of a description of the Company Board Recommendation
in the Offer Documents. During the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall: (A)(1) fail to make, withhold, withdraw
(or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company Board Recommendation or
(2) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in
clause (A) of this  _Section 6.6(d)(i)_ being referred to as a " _Company
Adverse Change Recommendation_ "); (B) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company
Board Recommendation within ten Business Days after Parent so requests in
writing; or (C) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company to execute or
enter into any Contract with respect to, any Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.6(b)_ ). 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.6(d)(i)_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if (I)
the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal (which
Takeover Proposal did not result from or arise out of or in connection with a
breach of this Section 6.6) from any Person that has not been withdrawn and,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company Financial
Advisor, the Company Board and the Special Committee have determined in good
faith that such Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal (after giving effect
to all of the revisions to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by
Parent, including pursuant to clause (C) below) or (II) there has been an
Intervening Event, then (x) the Company Board or the Special Committee prior
to the Acceptance Time may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or (y)
in the case of a Superior Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 8.1(d)_ in order to enter into a Specified
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in the case of each of
clauses (I) and (II), if and only if: (A) the Company Board and the Special
Committee have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards and the Special Committees
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; (B) the
Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of its intention to make
a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.1(d)_ at least four Business Days prior to making any such
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination (a " _Determination
Notice_ "), which notice shall have included (1) with respect to an
Intervening Event, a description of the Intervening Event or (2) with respect
to such Superior Proposal (which notice shall have included a copy of the
Specified Agreement (in the case of clause (y) above), the identity of the
Person making such Superior Proposal, a summary of the terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal in accordance with, and any other information required
by, _Section 6.6(b)_ ); (C)(1) the Company shall have

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 47 Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
make other proposals so that either (aa) such Takeover Proposal would cease
to constitute a Superior Proposal or (bb) such Intervening Event would cease
to warrant a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, and shall have made its
Representatives available to, and negotiated in good faith with, Parent with
respect to such proposed revisions or other proposals, if any, during such
period, (2) at the end of such period, after considering the results of such
negotiations and giving effect to such proposed revisions or other
proposals made by Parent, if any, and after consultation with outside legal
counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, the Company Board and the Special
Committee shall have determined in good faith that such Takeover Proposal is
still a Superior Proposal or such Intervening Event continues to warrant a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation and, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to make such Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)_
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards and the Special Committees
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law. For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 6.6(d)(ii)_ shall also
apply to every material amendment to any Takeover Proposal and shall require a
new Determination Notice be delivered to Parent in accordance with clause (B)
above, except that the "matching" period described in clauses (B) and (C)
above shall be two Business Days rather than the initial four Business Day
period.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to advancement of expenses,
indemnification and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each
Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement

Company (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") for such Persons acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time in his or her capacity as an officer or
director of the Company as provided in the Company Charter Documents as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other
indemnification agreements identified on _Section 6.7(a)_ of the Company

judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages and liabilities incurred by such
Indemnified Party in his or her capacity as a current or former officer or
director of the Company in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out
of or pertains to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions,
in either case, to the fullest extent permitted by the Company
Charter Documents, any other indemnification agreements identified on

this Agreement, or applicable Law. From and after the Effective Time until the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so
contain, provisions no less favorable in any material respect regarding
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnified
Parties than are set forth in the Company Charter Documents as in effect on
the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent shall either (i) cause to be maintained in effect, for a period of
six years after the Effective Time, the directors and officers liability

Time with respect to those Persons who are covered by the DandO Insurance as of
the Effective Time, or (ii) obtain, in consultation with the Company, a
prepaid (or "tail") directors and officers liability insurance policy
covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for a
period of six years after the Effective Time, with respect to those Persons
who are covered by the DandO Insurance as of the Effective Time on terms with
respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable to such indemnified
Persons than those of the DandO Insurance; provided, that (A) Parent may
substitute one or more policies of a reputable and financially sound insurance
company for the DandO Insurance, so long as such substitute policies have
at least the same coverage and amounts and contain terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous to the Persons currently covered by the DandO
Insurance; (B) Parent shall not be required to pay any annual premium for the
DandO Insurance or any substitutes with respect thereto in excess of 250% of
the amount paid by the Company for coverage for the period of 12 months most
recently commenced prior to the date of this Agreement (such amount paid by
the Company, the " _Maximum Amount_ "); and (C) if the premium for the DandO
Insurance or any substitutes therefor exceeds 250% of the Maximum Amount,
Parent shall purchase a substitute policy with the greatest coverage available
for 250% of the Maximum Amount. Parent shall provide, or cause to be
provided, a copy of such DandO Insurance to each current director and officer of
the Company.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_.

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ applies without the
written consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed
that the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, each of whom may
enforce the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_).

purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)(_ _iii)_ , all references to "20%" in the

---|---|--- 

(c) Any fee due under _Section 8.3(b)(i)_ shall be paid to Parent by wire
transfer of same-day funds within two Business Days after the date of
termination of this Agreement. Any fee under _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_ shall be

Takeover Proposal or (ii) the consummation of any Takeover Proposal.

 

(d) In the event that Parent receives full payment pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 8.3_, the receipt of the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Transactions
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates
arising out of this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming
the basis for such termination. The Company shall not be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __
_ 8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences an Action which

 





     |  |

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 54  results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay Parent its
reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, this Agreement may be

respective Boards of Directors, at any time. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

 

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and
(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such

signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not apply to
any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or
noncompliance with any agreement, covenant or condition, as the case may be,
other than that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of
any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or

contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever

the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form

and also to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and
interpretations thereof, unless the context requires otherwise. Any reference

January 17, 2017; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of _Section_ __ _
3.9_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.21_, the words "made available to Parent" mean
that the engagement letter referred to _Section_ __ _ 3.9_ and the Fairness
Opinion referred to in _Section_ __ _ 3.21, _respectively, were delivered by
electronic mail to Parent by the Company or its Representatives immediately
prior to the execution of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that they
have been represented by counsel during the negotiation, drafting,
preparation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the
application of any Law or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in
an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting
such agreement or document.

Section 9.4 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware irrespective of the choice
of laws principles of the state of Delaware, as to all matters, including
matters of validity, construction, effect, enforceability, performance and
remedies and in respect of the statute of limitations or any other limitations
period applicable to any claim, controversy or dispute.

(b) Each party to this Agreement (i) irrevocably and unconditionally submits
to the personal jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts (as defined below), (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that
any actions or proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be brought, tried and determined only in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (the " _Chosen
Courts_ "), (iv) waives any claim of improper venue or any claim that the
Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum and (v) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any court other
than the Chosen Courts. The parties to this Agreement agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ or in such other manner as may be
permitted by applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Page 57 (c) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with
respect to any Action directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the parties hereto
hereby: (i) certifies that no Representative of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of any such Action, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver; and (ii)
acknowledges that it has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 9.4(c)_.

Section 9.5 _Counterparts; Facsimile Transmission of Signatures_. This
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, and delivered by means of facsimile,
email or other electronic transmission, each of which when so executed and
delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Receipt of a partys
executed signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, email or
other electronic transmission with permission to release such signature page
shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement by such
party.

 

Section 9.6 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and all
of the provisions hereto shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations set forth herein shall be assigned by any party hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any purported
assignment without such consent shall be void, except that Parent may assign
all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent without the Companys prior
consent; provided, however, that no assignment shall release Parent of its
obligations hereunder. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not, confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.7_; and (b) from and after the Effective Time,
the rights of holders of shares of the Company Common Stock, holders of
Options, and holders of Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, to receive the
consideration set forth in _Article 2_.

 

Section 9.7 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable Law, then such
contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Such
provision shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it
legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such modification shall render it
legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement shall be construed as if not
containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of
the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly.

 

Section 9.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Annex and Exhibits hereto and the documents and
instruments referred to herein that are to be delivered at Closing) and the
Confidentiality Agreement (as amended pursuant to _Section 6.5(b)_ ) contain
all of the terms of the understandings of the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them,
written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 |  | Page 58 Section 9.9 _Enforcement; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that each of the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Section 9.10 _Disclosure Letter_. The inclusion of any information in the
Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the
terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or is outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

Section 9.11  _Non-Recourse_. Any claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement may only be brought against
Persons that are expressly named as parties hereto, and then only
with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein. No former, current
or future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling Persons,
stockholders, Representatives, affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners or assignees of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective affiliates shall have any liability or obligation for any of
the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or
liabilities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement or of
or for any action, suit, arbitration, claim, litigation, investigation, or
proceeding based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions
(including the breach, termination or failure to consummate such
Transactions), in each case whether based on Contract, tort, strict
liability, other Laws or otherwise and whether by piercing the corporate veil,
by a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or another Person or otherwise.

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Agreement to the contrary,
Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the
Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return
tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to
pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, and may delay the
acceptance for payment of or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC, the payment for, any tendered Shares, and (subject to the
provisions of the Agreement) may terminate the Offer and not accept for
payment any tendered Shares: (i) if the Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with _Article 8_ of the Agreement; or (ii) at any scheduled
Expiration Date (as it may have been extended pursuant to _Section 1.1(c)_ of
the Agreement), if (x) the conditions in _clauses (a)_ and  _(d)_ below have
not been satisfied by one minute after 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the
Expiration Date or (y) any of the additional conditions set forth below shall
not be satisfied or waived in writing by Parent:

 

(a) the number of Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn (excluding
Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet
been delivered in satisfaction of such guarantee), together with any Shares
beneficially owned by Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, equals
at least a majority of the Fully Diluted Shares then outstanding (the "
_Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

(b) any waiting period (and any extensions thereof) applicable to consummation
of the Offer under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated;

(c) there shall not be pending any Action by any Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction that seeks, directly or indirectly, to make
illegal, prohibit, materially delay or otherwise restrain the making of the
Offer, the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the performance of the
Agreement;

 

(d) no Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Judgment (preliminary or
permanent) or Law that has resulted in, or is reasonably likely to result in
any of the consequences referred to in _clause (c)_ of this _Annex A_ ;

 

(e) each of the Companys representations and warranties set forth in (i) _
Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_, _Section 3.3(a)_ , _Section 3.3(d)_ , _Section
3.3(e)_ , _Section 3.3(f)_ and the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ of
the Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of the
Agreement and at and as of the Acceptance Time (except to the extent any such
representation or warranty is made as of a specific date, in which case as of
such date); (ii) _Section_ __ _ 3.2_ of the

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Annex A, Page 1  Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of the
Agreement and at and as of the Acceptance Time (except to the extent any such
representation or warranty is made as of a specific date, in which case as of
such date), except for any failures to be so true and correct that are _de
minimis_ ; and (iii) the Agreement (other than those representations and
warranties set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.2_,
_Section 3.3(a)_ , _Section 3.3(d)_ , _Section 3.3(e)_ , _Section 3.3(f)_ and
the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ of the Agreement) shall be true
and correct in all respects as of the date of the Agreement and at and as of
the Acceptance Time (except to the extent any such representation or warranty
is made as of a specific date, in which case as of such date), except where
the failure of any of such representations or warranties to be so true and
correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" set forth in such representations
and warranties) has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 

(f) the Company shall have complied with or performed in all material respects
the covenants and obligations required to be complied with or performed by it
under the Agreement at or prior to the Acceptance Time;

(g) Parent and Merger Sub shall have received a certificate executed by the
Companys Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer confirming on
behalf of the Company that the conditions set forth in _clauses (e)_ and

(h) the Agreement shall not have been validly terminated in accordance with
_Article 8_ of the Agreement; and

 

(i) there shall not have occurred any Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
(except for the Minimum Tender Condition) may be waived by Parent or Merger
Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time in the sole
discretion of Parent or Merger Sub. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any
time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of
any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may
be asserted at any time and from time to time.

reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect
to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation, whether
the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving
as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as
the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any
such amendment, to the fullest extent permitted by law, only to the extent
that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification
rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such
amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys
fees, judgments, fines, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, and excise
taxes or penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection
therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, except as provided in paragraph (b) below, the Corporation
shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized by the Board. The right to indemnification
conferred in this Article shall be a contract right and shall include the
right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any
such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, if the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a
director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not
in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person
while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding,
shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or
on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled
to be indemnified under this Article or otherwise. The Corporation may, by
action of the Board, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the
Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of
directors and officers.

Agreement and Plan of Merger

 |  | Exhibit B, Page 2 (b) If a claim under paragraph (a) above is not paid in full by the
Corporation within 30 days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other
than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending
any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the
required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make
it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant
for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on
the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its board
of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification
of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its board of
directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant
has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable
standard of conduct.

 

(c) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in
defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this
Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation (as it may be amended from time to time), by-law, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
