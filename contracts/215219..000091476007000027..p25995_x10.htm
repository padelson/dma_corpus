---|---|--- 
 

   

Dear Larisa:

  

Reference is hereby made to that certain Subscription Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of December 14, 2006 (the " _Agreement_ "), by and among
ProQuest Information and Learning Company, a Delaware corporation (the " _U.S.
Company_ "); IandL Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer Parent_ ");
IandL Operating LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned
subsidiary of Buyer Parent (" _Buyer Sub_ ," and with Buyer Parent, the "
_Buying Parties_ "); ProQuest Company (" _Parent_ "), a Delaware corporation;
ProQuest Canada/U.K. Holdings, LLC, a  Delaware limited liability company and
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Canada/U.K. LLC_ "); and, solely for
purposes of Article V and Section 12.1 of the Agreement, Cambridge Scientific
Abstracts, Limited Partnership, a Maryland limited partnership (" _Guarantor_
"). All capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the
meanings given to them in the Agreement.

  

The following sets forth certain amendments to the Agreement hereby agreed to
by the undersigned and the Buying Parties:

  



  

1. _Cash Balance_. Parent will cause the Acquired Entities to have, as of the Closing Date, (a) no more than 2.5 million British Pounds of cash, (b) no more than $500,000 Canadian Dollars of cash, and (c) no more than the equivalent of US$2 million of cash in other non-U.S. currencies. When determining the final amount of the Closing Working Capital Value, any and all cash and cash accounts held by the Acquired Entities on the Closing Date shall be included in the definition of Current Assets used in the calculation of the Closing Working Capital Value. For purposes of calculating the Closing Working Capital Value, all cash in a currency other than U.S. dollars shall be converted into U.S. dollars at the average of the bid and ask rates found on the  Yahoo! finance exchange web page as of 5:00 p.m. on the date of Closing.

  

2. _Issuance Price_. The first sentence of Section 2.3(a) of the Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following sentence:

  

"The aggregate consideration in the Issuance for all of the Preferred Stock
shall be $109,000,000 (the " _Issuance Price_ ")."

  

3. _Purchase Price Allocation_. _Schedule 2.3_ of the Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with a new _Schedule 2.3_ in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_.

       

4. _Subsidiary Mergers_. The Buying Parties have requested that the U.S. Company effect the mergers of certain subsidiaries of the U.S. Company described on _Exhibit B_ prior to the Closing (the " _Subsidiary Mergers_ "). The Buying Parties jointly and severally shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnitees_ ") in respect of any and all Losses reasonably and proximately incurred by any Parent Indemnitee as a result of the Subsidiary Mergers.

  

5. _Amendment to Articles of Association for ProQuest Brazil Ltda_. In accordance with _Section 6.1(h_ ) of the Agreement, Buyer Parent approves and consents to an amendment to the Articles of Association of ProQuest Brazil Ltda. (" _ProQuest Brazil_ ") to alter the capital structure of ProQuest Brazil and eliminate the amount of unpaid quotas.

  

6. _NAPC Acquisition Related Liabilities_. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless any Buyer Indemnitee in respect of any and all Losses reasonably and proximately incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee as a result of the claims or threatened claims made in the letters referenced in _Exhibit C_ hereto. For the avoidance of doubt, any such claims shall be deemed a "Third Party Claim" subject to Section 10.4 of the Agreement.

  

7. _Canadian Witholding Taxes_. Parent hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Buyer Indemnitee in respect of any and all taxes, fines or penalties assessed by the Canadian tax authorities in connection with the transfer of ProQuest Information Access Ltd. to ProQuest Canada/U.K. LLC (" _Canadian Contribution_ "). The Buying Parties agree to use reasonable efforts to obtain a 116 Clearance Certificate with respect to the Canadian Contribution (the application for which is currently pending) as soon as practicable after Closing. In the event the Buying Parties receive any inquiry or other communication from the Canadian authorities with respect to the Canadian Contribution, the Buying  Parties agree to notify Parent as soon as practicable of such inquiry or communication, and Parent shall be entitled to assume the response to such inquiry or communication as the attorney-in-fact for the Buying Parties.

  

8. _Time of Closing Working Capital Value Calculation_. For the purposes of the Agreement, Closing Working Capital Value shall be calculated as of 5.00 p.m. on the date of Closing.

  

Except as otherwise provided herein, all of the terms, covenants and other
provisions of the Agreement shall continue to be in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms. This letter agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware.

  

This letter agreement may be executed on separate counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

  

Please indicate your acknowledgement and agreement to the foregoing in the
