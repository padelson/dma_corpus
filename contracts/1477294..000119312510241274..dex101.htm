3.4 Working Capital.

(a) Within 90 days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Honeywell (i) a statement (the " _Preliminary Working Capital
Statement_ "), setting forth a calculation of the Net Working Capital (the "
_Preliminary Net Working Capital_ ") as of the close of business on the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) a calculation of the amount due
and owing and a statement setting forth the responsible party therefor in
accordance with _Section 3.4(f)_, in each case, prepared in accordance with
the Specified Accounting Policies and GAAP. The " _Final Net Working Capital_
" shall be the Preliminary Net Working Capital shown on the Preliminary
Working Capital Statement, as modified pursuant to this _Section 3.4_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in no
event shall the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital be affected by
any Purchaser purchase accounting adjustments for the transactions taking
place on or after the Closing.

(b) Unless Honeywell notifies Purchaser in writing that Honeywell disagrees
with any aspect of the Preliminary Working Capital Statement (such notice to
include Honeywells objections, a reasonable description of the basis
therefor and reasonably detailed proposed revisions to said documents), within
sixty (60) days after receipt thereof, the Preliminary Working Capital
Statement shall be conclusive and binding on the parties and shall be the
Final Net Working Capital. If Honeywell so notifies Purchaser in writing
within such sixty (60) day period, then Honeywell and Purchaser shall attempt
to resolve their differences with respect thereto in good faith within fifteen
(15) days after Purchasers receipt of Honeywells written notice of
disagreement. If Honeywell and Purchaser resolve their differences with
respect to the Preliminary Working Capital Statement within such fifteen (15)
day period, then the Preliminary Working Capital Statement, with such
modifications necessary to reflect such agreement of Honeywell and Purchaser,
shall be conclusive and binding on the parties and shall be the Final Net
Working Capital. Any disputes not resolved by Honeywell and Purchaser within
such fifteen (15) day period regarding the Preliminary Working Capital
Statement (the " _Disputed Amount_ ") will be resolved by an Independent
Accounting Firm jointly retained by Honeywell and Purchaser. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall make a determination only on the Disputed Amount as well
as such modifications, if any, to the Preliminary Working Capital Statement
necessary to reflect such determination, and the same shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties, except as provided by applicable Law. The
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm for any item in dispute
cannot, however, be in excess of, nor less than, the greatest or lowest value,
respectively, claimed for that particular item in the Preliminary Working
Capital Statement, in the case of Purchaser, or in the notice described in the
first sentence of this paragraph, in the case of Honeywell. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by the parties as
follows: Honeywell shall pay a percentage of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm equal to: (i) the difference, if any, between
Honeywells estimated value of the Final Net Working Capital as submitted to
the Independent Accounting Firm and the Independent Accounting Firms final
determination of Final Net Working Capital divided by (ii) the Disputed
Amount. Purchaser 

 



25  shall pay the remaining percentage, if any, of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm (it being understood that in the event the Final
Net Working Capital is equal to the Preliminary Net Working Capital
determined by a party (as submitted to arbitration by such party), the other
party shall pay all fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm). The
Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to render its decision in
accordance with the terms hereof, including the Specified Accounting Policies.

(c) In connection with Honeywells review of the Preliminary Working Capital
Statement and preparation of any notice of objection, Honeywell and its
representatives shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance written notice, to the books and records, the
financial systems and finance personnel and any other information of Purchaser
and the Purchased Entities that Honeywell reasonably requests, including all
relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by
Purchasers accountants and other advisors (subject to customary
indemnification and other agreements that may be requested by Purchasers
accountants and other advisors) in connection with Purchasers preparation of
the Preliminary Working Capital Statement, and Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries (including the Purchased Entities), and shall use
reasonable efforts to cause its accountants and other advisors, to cooperate
reasonably with Honeywell and its representatives in connection therewith.

(d) In connection with Purchasers review of any notice of
objection, Purchaser and its representatives shall have reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance written notice, to
all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by
Honeywell or its accountants and other advisors (subject to customary
indemnification and other agreements that may be requested by Honeywells
accountants and other advisors) and to finance personnel of Honeywell and its
representatives and any other information which Purchaser reasonably
requests, and Honeywell shall, and shall use reasonable efforts to cause its
accountants and other advisors to, cooperate reasonably with Purchaser and its
representatives in connection therewith.

 

(e) No later than thirty (30) days after the engagement of the Independent
Accounting Firm, as evidenced by its written acceptance by facsimile or
otherwise to the parties, each of Honeywell and Purchaser shall submit a brief
to the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy to the other party) setting
forth its respective positions regarding the issues in dispute. No later
than thirty (30) days after submission of the initial brief, each of
Honeywell and Purchaser shall submit a reply brief (with a copy to the other
party). The Independent Accounting Firm shall render its decision resolving
the dispute within thirty (30) days after submission of the last reply brief.
If additional briefing, a hearing, or other information is required by the
Independent Accounting Firm, the Independent Accounting Firm shall give notice
thereof to the parties as soon as practicable before the expiration of such
thirty (30) day period, and the parties shall promptly respond with a view to
minimizing any delay in the decision date.

(f) In accordance with the procedure described above in this _Section 3.4_,
the Initial Purchase Price shall be (i) increased on a dollar for dollar basis
by the amount by which the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the
Targeted Net Working Capital, or (ii) decreased on a dollar for dollar basis
by the amount by which the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Targeted
Net Working Capital.

 



26 (g) Honeywell or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall deposit the amounts, if
any, owed by it, as the case may be, under subsection (f) above, together with
interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment at a floating
rate equal to the U.S. dollar prime rate per annum, as quoted by JPMorgan
Chase and Co., from time to time during such period, in immediately available
funds, to a bank account designated by the other party no later than five (5)
business days after the Final Net Working Capital has been agreed to or
deemed to be agreed to by, or has been delivered by the Independent Accounting
Firm.

 

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the parties agree that any matter specifically resolved and
reflected as part of the Final Net Working Capital under this _Section 3.4_
shall not also be recoverable as a Loss pursuant to _Article VIII_ or
_Article X_ solely to the extent that the amount of such Loss is reflected
as a current liability in the Final Net Working Capital and actually resulted
in an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.4(f)_.

3.5 Purchase Price Allocation.

(a) The Purchase Price allocated to the Equity Interests in each of the
Purchased Entities and to the Purchased Assets (net of Assumed Liabilities) of
each Asset Seller shall be in accordance with the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule attached hereto as _Exhibit A-1_, subject to adjustment pursuant to
_Section 3.4_, and no party shall take a position inconsistent with such
allocation on any Tax Return (unless otherwise required by a final,
nonappealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction or a binding
closing agreement entered into with a Taxing Authority). The parties shall
promptly inform one another in writing of any challenge by any Taxing
Authority to any Purchase Price allocation made pursuant to this Agreement and
agree to consult with and keep one another informed with respect to the
status of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with respect to, any
such challenge. Within thirty (30) days following (i) the determination of any
excess or deficit in accordance with _Section 3.4(f)_, (ii) an
indemnification payment pursuant to _Section 8.4_ or (iii) an indemnification
payment pursuant to _Article X_ , in each case, the Sellers and Purchaser
shall revise the purchase price allocation to reflect such excess, deficit or
payment in accordance with the nature of each relevant excess, deficit or
payment (or if the nature of each relevant excess, deficit or payment cannot
be reasonably determined, consistent with the proportional allocation of
value described in _Exhibit A-1_ ).

(b) The portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the Purchased Assets (net
of Assumed Liabilities) of Honeywell as set forth on _Exhibit A-1_ plus those
Assumed Liabilities of Honeywell that constitute Liabilities for federal
income tax purposes (the " _Gross US Purchase Price_ ") shall be allocated
among the Purchased Assets of Honeywell in the manner required by Section 1060
of the Code as shown on an allocation schedule to be prepared by Purchaser as
soon as practicable after the Closing Date. The template of the allocation
schedule is attached hereto as _Exhibit A-2_. Purchaser shall provide
Honeywell with such allocation schedule and Purchaser shall make such
revisions or changes to such schedule as shall be reasonably requested by
Honeywell and approved by Purchaser, each acting in good faith. In the

 



27  event Purchaser and Honeywell are unable to agree on the allocation of the
Gross US Purchase Price in such manner, then each (acting reasonably and in
good faith) shall be free to do its own allocation of the Gross US Purchase
Price. In the event Purchaser and Honeywell do agree on the allocation of the
Gross US Purchase Price, then such allocation shall be binding on them for
federal, state, local and other Tax reporting purposes, including filings on
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, and neither of them will assert or
maintain a position inconsistent with such allocation.

(c) The portion of the Purchase Price allocated on _Exhibit A-1_ to the
Purchased Assets (net of Assumed Liabilities) of each of HON Korea and HON
Czech plus the Assumed Liabilities of each of HON Korea and HON Czech (in
each case, the " _Gross Foreign Purchase Price_ ") shall be allocated among
the Purchased Assets of each of HON Korea and HON Czech as shown on an
allocation schedule to be prepared by Purchaser as soon as practicable after
the Closing Date. The template of the allocation schedule is attached hereto
as _Exhibit A-3_. Purchaser shall provide the Sellers with such allocation
schedule and Purchaser shall make such revisions or changes to such schedule
as shall be reasonably requested by the Sellers and approved by Purchaser,
each acting in good faith. In the event Purchaser and any of the Sellers are
unable to agree on the allocation of the Gross Foreign Purchase Price in such
manner, then each (acting reasonably and in good faith) shall be free to do
its own allocation of the Gross Foreign Purchase Price. In the event Purchaser
and the Sellers do agree on the allocation of the Gross Foreign Purchase
Price, then such allocation shall be binding on them for all Tax reporting
purposes, and none of them will assert or maintain a position inconsistent
with such allocation.

3.6 Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
Purchaser (and any other Person that has any withholding obligation with
respect to any payment made pursuant to this Agreement) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement
any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payments under the Code, the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, or
any other applicable provision of Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and deducted pursuant to this _Section 3.6_, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
If Purchaser intends to withhold pursuant to this _Section 3.6_, it shall
provide notice to Honeywell at least five (5) days prior to Closing.

contemplated by this Agreement, either alone or in combination with another
event.

43  machinery, equipment and other tangible assets included in the Purchased
Assets (except for stamping dies, failure analysis equipment, production
maintenance equipment and tool room equipment, and certain equipment that is
located at the facilities of certain suppliers of the Business) and the
location of such machinery, equipment and other tangible assets (for the
avoidance of doubt, such Section of the Disclosure Schedule shall not include
any tooling not owned by Sellers or any Purchased Entity). Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that (a) within two (2) business days after the date

describes in reasonable detail, certain equipment that is located at the
facilities of certain suppliers, and (b) prior to the Closing, Sellers shall

4.17 Sufficiency of Assets. The Sellers and Purchased Entities have, and
(except for assets sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of
business after the date hereof in compliance with _Section 6.1_ hereof) on
the Closing Date will have, all of the rights, title and interest to all
tangible Purchased Assets and all tangible assets of the Purchased Entities,
free and clear of any mortgage, lien, pledge, security interest, option, right
of first refusal, right of first offer, or similar charges (" _Liens_ "),
other than Permitted Encumbrances. Subject to the last sentence of this
_Section 4.17_, except as set forth in _Section 4.17_ of the Disclosure
Schedule (but including the goods and services provided by the Sellers and
their Affiliates under the Ancillary Agreements and _Section 6.3_ of this
Agreement), the Purchased Assets and the assets of the Purchased Entities
constitute all of the material assets (real, personal, tangible, intangible
or otherwise) used or held for use in the Business as it is currently operated
and are sufficient in all material respects to conduct and operate the
Business from and after the Closing Date in the same manner as currently
conducted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the immediately preceding sentence
does not apply to Intellectual Property. With respect to Intellectual
Property, the Sellers represent and warrant only that the Acquired
Intellectual Property together with the Intellectual Property licensed to
Purchaser under the Intellectual Property License Agreement constitutes all
the Intellectual Property necessary to make, use and sell the Existing
Products; _provided_ that the Sellers make no representation or warranty with
respect to any Intellectual Property to the extent associated with Excluded
Products. Except as set forth in _Section 4.17_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
none of the Sellers Affiliates own, utilize or have an interest in any
material assets of, perform any material services for, or on behalf of, or
provide any material group purchasing benefits to, or with respect to, the
Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties
contained in this  _Section 4.17_ do not apply to infringement or

currently being negotiated with any Seller or Purchased 

 



44  Entity; (ii) no material work stoppage or other material labor action or
dispute involving any Seller or Purchased Entity is pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened by any such labor dispute; and (iii) the
Sellers and Purchased Entities are operating the Business in compliance with
all applicable Labor Laws, except where the failure to comply would not
interfere in any material respect with the conduct of the Business as
presently conducted by the Sellers and the Purchased Entities or result in a
material (A) fine, (B) penalty or (C) other Loss to a Purchased Entity or
other Loss to the Business that would be an Assumed Liability. " _Labor Laws_
" means any applicable Law relating to the employment of labor, including
(without limitation) provisions thereof relating to employment standards,
human rights, health and safety, labor relations, wage and hour
statutes, immigration, layoffs, workplace safety and insurance and/or pay
equity.

(b) With respect to this transaction, any notice that the Sellers are
required to give under any Labor Law or collective bargaining agreement
(including any works council) has been (or will be) given, and all bargaining
obligations with any employee(s) and/or employee representative have been,
or prior to the Closing will be, satisfied. Except as set forth on _Section
4.18(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, within the past three years, neither the

such action will be implemented without advance notification to Purchaser.

policies relating to the Business or regarding any actual or possible
adjustment in the amount of the premiums payable with respect to any of said
policies, or (b) any written notice regarding any refusal of coverage under,
or any rejection of any claim under, any such policies.

(a) (i) Since January 1, 2009, the products made, assembled, or sold by the
Business have conformed in all material respects with all applicable
contractual commitments, express and implied warranties and Laws, in each case
that would give rise to any Ordinary Course Warranty Obligations; and (ii) the

5.1 Corporate Status. Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and
Purchaser (a) has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted, and (b) is duly qualified or otherwise
authorized to do business and is in good standing in each of the jurisdictions
in which the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties and assets and
the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified or otherwise
authorized, except where the failure to be so qualified or otherwise
authorized would not have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 

5.2 Authority. Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and under
the Ancillary Agreements, and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. The

 



46  execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Purchaser, and no other corporate proceeding
on the part of Purchaser is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance by Purchaser of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement
has been, and upon execution, the Ancillary Agreements will be, duly executed
and delivered by Purchaser, and, assuming due authorization and delivery
by the Sellers, this Agreement constitutes, and upon execution the Ancillary
Agreements will constitute, a valid and binding obligation of Purchaser,
enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws now or hereinafter in effect relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally or by general equitable principles
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

5.3 No Conflict; Required Filings.

 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), conflict with, or result
in any violation of or default under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a benefit under,
or result in the creation of any material Encumbrance upon any of the
properties or assets of Purchaser under, any provision of (i) the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of Purchaser, (ii) any material Contract to which
Purchaser is party or by which it is bound or (iii) any Governmental Order or,
subject to the matters described in clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section 5.3(b)_,
Law applicable to Purchaser or its property or assets, other than, in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such conflicts, violations,
defaults, rights or Encumbrances that would not have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.3(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, no
material consent authorization, approval, or exemption of, or registration,
declaration, notice or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required to
be obtained or made by Purchaser in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, other than
(i) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act, and (ii) to the extent
applicable, compliance with and filings under similar Laws of foreign
jurisdictions other than the United States.

5.4 Legal Proceedings. There are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective properties before any Governmental Authority, except as would
not have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 

5.5 Sufficient Funds.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser, together with Sensata
Technologies B.V., has cash in an amount sufficient to pay the Purchase Price
in full and any related fees or expenses. At the Closing Date, Purchaser will
have cash in an amount sufficient to pay the Purchase Price in full and any
related fees or expenses.

 



47 (b) Immediately following the Closing after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, Purchaser will be Solvent. As used herein, " _Solvent_ "
means with respect to any Person on a particular date, that on such date (i)
the fair value of the property of such Person is greater than the total
amount of Liabilities, including contingent Liabilities, of such Person, (ii)
the present fair salable value of the assets of such Person is not less than
the amount that will be required to pay the probable Liability of such Person
on its debts as they become absolute and matured, (iii) such Person does not
intend to, and does not believe that it will, incur debts or Liabilities
beyond such Persons ability to pay such debts and Liabilities as they mature
and (iv) such Person is not engaged in business or a transaction, and is not
about to engage in business or a transaction, for which such Persons property
would constitute an unreasonably small capital. The amount of contingent
Liabilities at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in light of all
the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that
can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured Liability.

5.6 Investment Intent. Purchaser has such Knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the risks and
merits associated with the acquisition of the Equity Interests and is
acquiring the Equity Interests for its own account for investment, with no
present intention of making a public distribution thereof. Purchaser will not
sell or otherwise dispose of the Equity Interests in violation of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws.

5.7 No Reliance.

(a) Purchaser is an informed and sophisticated purchaser and has engaged
expert advisors who are experienced in the evaluation and purchase of
businesses such as the Business (including the Purchased Entities) as
contemplated hereunder, and has had such access to the personnel and
properties of the Purchased Entities, the Sellers and their Affiliates as it
deems necessary and appropriate to make such evaluation and purchase.

(b) Purchaser has agreed to purchase the Purchased Assets and assume the
Assumed Liabilities based on its own inspection, examination and determination
with respect to all matters and without reliance upon any representations,
warranties, communications or disclosures of any nature other than those
expressly set forth in this Agreement.

(c) Purchaser does not have any special relationship with any Seller, or any
employee, officer, director, agent, advisor, representative or Affiliate of
any Seller, that would justify any expectation beyond that of any ordinary
buyer and any ordinary seller in an arms length transaction and Purchaser is
not owed any duty or entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser, in entering
into this Agreement, acknowledges and agrees that (i) no officer, agent,
advisor, employee or representative of the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates has any authority, express or implied, to make any representations,
warranties or agreements not specifically set 

 



48  forth in this Agreement and subject to the limited remedies provided herein,
(ii) Purchaser is relying solely on the representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement and, except as expressly set forth in _Article IV_
of this Agreement (as qualified by the disclosure in the Disclosure
Schedules), and (iii) neither the Sellers nor any other Person makes any
representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to, and
Purchaser expressly disclaims any reliance on, (A) any information included in
the Information Package dated November 12, 2009 related to the Business
(including the Purchased Entities) or other matters; (B) any information,
written or oral and in any form provided, Made Available to it or any of its
agents, advisors, employees or representatives; (C) any projections, estimates
or budgets delivered to or Made Available to it or any of its
agents, advisors, employees or representatives, or which is Made Available to
it or any of its agents, advisors, employees or representatives after the date
hereof, or future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of
operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of the Sellers or the Purchased Entities
or the future business and operations of the Sellers or the Purchased
Entities; (D) the condition of any of the Property being transferred
hereunder, which Purchaser is purchasing on an "AS IS, WITH ALL FAULTS" basis
without any warranties or guarantees of any kind from the Sellers or the
Purchased Entities; (E) the operation of the Business by Purchaser after
Closing in any manner; (F) the probable success or profitability of the
ownership, use or operation of the Business (including the Purchased Entities)
by Purchaser after the Closing; or (G) the accuracy or completeness of any
other information, written or oral and in any form provided, or documents
previously Made Available or which is made available after the date hereof to
it or any of its agents, advisors, employees or representatives with respect
to the Sellers, the Purchased Entities or their respective businesses and
operations or other related matters, whether in expectation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in the foregoing
shall limit the right of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to rely on the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement and to
their rights to indemnification under _Articles VIII_ and _X_ , or shall
limit a claim by a Purchaser Indemnified Party alleging that
Sellers defrauded such Person by intentionally omitting or misstating any
disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule where such omission or misstatement
constitutes a breach in any material respect of any such express
representation or warranty, which rights and claims shall, in any case, be
subject to the provisions of _Sections 4.23_, _5.7(a)_ - _(d)_ , _11.7_ and
_11.8_.

5.8 Finders Fee. Purchaser has not incurred any Liability to any party for
any brokerage or finders fee or agents commission, or the like, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Purchaser for which the Sellers or their
respective stockholders, option holders, directors, officers or Affiliates
will be liable based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates.

5.9 DISCLAIMER OF OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
SET FORTH IN THIS _ARTICLE V_ , PURCHASER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, WITH RESPECT
TO PURCHASER, ITS BUSINESSES OR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR ANY OF ITS
ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR OPERATIONS OR ANY OTHER MATTER, AND ANY SUCH OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.

(a) Honeywell and Purchaser shall as promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than ten (10) business days after the date hereof, cause to be filed
with the FTC and the DOJ the notification and report form pursuant to the HSR
Act required for the transactions contemplated hereby and cause to be filed
with the relevant Governmental Authorities (" _Other Competition Authorities_
") the other filings contemplated by _Section 4.3(b)(ii)_ and _Section
5.3(b)(ii)_ (" _Other Competition Filings_ "), and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain early termination of the applicable waiting
period or expedited review, as applicable, of such notifications and related
materials. The Sellers and Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable,
comply with any request for additional information and documents pursuant to
the HSR Act and applicable Laws governing the Other Competition Filings ("
_Other Competition Law_ "). The Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on
the other hand, shall inform the other promptly of any communication made by
or on behalf of such party to (including permitting the other party to review
such communication in advance), or received from, the FTC, the DOJ or
the Other Competition Authorities and shall furnish to the other such
information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of any filing, submission or other act that is necessary
or advisable under the HSR Act or the Other Competition Laws. The Sellers, on
the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall keep each other timely
appraised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, the FTC or the DOJ or the Other
Competition Authorities, and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or
request. No party shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other
inquiries unless it consults with the other party in advance, and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

 

(b) Purchaser shall take as promptly as reasonably practicable any and all
steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust or competition Law that may be asserted by any U.S. federal, state,
provincial, local or foreign antitrust or competition authority so as to
enable the parties to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; _provided_ that Purchaser
need not divest or hold separate assets, terminate or modify existing business
relationships, or take any other such steps to the extent that such actions
would have a material adverse effect on the Business or an equivalent (rather
than proportionate) level of impact on the business of Purchaser. In addition,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing regarding Governmental
Authorities but subject to the immediately preceding proviso, Purchaser
agrees to take promptly any and all steps necessary to attempt to vacate or
lift any order or other restraint relating to antitrust matters that would
have the effect of making the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
illegal or otherwise prohibiting its consummation.

(c) The parties hereto shall cooperate with one another in determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority (excluding the actions and filings described in clause (a) above),
is required or reasonably appropriate, or any action, consent, approval or
waiver from any party to any material Contract is required or reasonably
appropriate, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and Honeywell
shall cooperate as reasonably 

 



52  requested by Purchaser in connection with any action by Purchaser pursuant
to _Section 6.2(b)_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including _Section 6.8_) and the Confidentiality Agreement, in taking such
actions or making any such filings, the parties hereto shall furnish
information required in connection therewith and timely seek to obtain any
such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. 

(d) Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, Honeywell and Purchaser
shall execute or cause their applicable Affiliates to execute the China
Transfer Agreement and the unanimous board resolutions of HON Shanghai and the
amendments to each of the Joint Venture Agreement and Articles of Association
of HON Shanghai contemplated by the China Transfer Agreement. Honeywell and
Purchaser acknowledge and agree that, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the China Transfer Agreement and applicable Laws, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the China Transfer
Agreement will occur simultaneously with the Closing. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event of any conflict or discrepancy between this Agreement and
the China Transfer Agreement, this Agreement shall control. Honeywell and
Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ten
(10) business days after the later of the date hereof and the date on which
the China Consent has been executed and delivered by Shanghai Creation
Electronics Co., Ltd. (" _SCEC_ "), cause to be filed with the Chinese
Governmental Authorities the China Transfer Agreement (and applications
related thereto); it being understood and agreed by the parties hereto that,
to the extent SCEC requires any revisions to the China Transfer Agreement,
the parties thereto shall re-execute the China Transfer Agreement with such
revisions as are necessary and reasonably acceptable to Honeywell and
Purchaser. The Sellers and Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable, comply
with any reasonable request for additional information and documents
requested by the Chinese Governmental Authorities. The Sellers, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall inform the other promptly of any
communication made by or on behalf of such party to (including permitting the
other party to review such communication in advance), or received from, the
Chinese Governmental Authorities and shall furnish to the other such
information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of any filing, submission or other act that is necessary
or advisable to be delivered to the Chinese Governmental Authorities. The
Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall keep
each other timely appraised of the status of any communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from, the Chinese
Governmental Authorities, and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or
request. No party shall agree to participate in any meeting with the Chinese
Governmental Authorities in respect of any such filings, investigation or
other inquiries unless it consults with the other party in advance, and to the
extent permitted by the Chinese Governmental Authorities, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

(e) The parties shall work together and use commercially reasonable efforts
to take all necessary actions to submit the equity transfer documents
(including the China Transfer Agreement) in their approved form to the
competent Chinese Registration Authority as soon as practicable, but in no
event more than thirty (30) days following the approval of the equity transfer
of HON Shanghai by the competent Chinese Approval Authority, in order to have
it issue a new business license to HON Shanghai reflecting the equity
transfer (the date on which such new business license is granted, the " _HON
Shanghai Registration Date_ "). In the event that, after the parties have
complied with the foregoing (including by amending the equity transfer 

 



53  documents as may be requested by the Chinese Registration Authority, which
amendments must also be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser), (i) the Chinese
Registration Authority finally determines that it will not issue a new
business license to HON Shanghai that reflects the equity transfer
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) HON Shanghai fails to obtain such new
business license due to the proposed amendments to the equity transfer
documents requested by the Chinese Registration Authority not being reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser or (iii)(A) the Chinese Approval Authority has
approved the transfer of the HON Shanghai Equity Interests from HON China to
Purchaser or (B) the Chinese Registration Authority has registered Purchaser
as a shareholder of HON Shanghai, but in the case of either subclause (A) or
(B), this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the
Closing Date (the occurrence of any event in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above
is hereinafter referred to as a " _HON Shanghai Determination Event_ "),
Honeywell shall re-acquire, or shall cause its designated Affiliate to re-
acquire, from Purchaser all of the transferred Equity Interest in HON
Shanghai for an amount equal to the HON Shanghai Purchase Price (where the HON
Shanghai Purchase Price has been previously paid in accordance with _Section
3.1_ of the Purchase Agreement) or in the event of a HON Shanghai
Determination Event pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) agree to reduce the
Purchase Price under the Purchase Agreement by such amount (in the event the
applicable HON Shanghai Determination Event occurs prior to the Closing).
Further, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that from and after the HON
Shanghai Registration Date (in the event the HON Shanghai Registration Date
occurs prior to the Closing Date) through the Closing, Sellers shall, for all
purposes under this Agreement and otherwise, continue to operate HON Shanghai
for their own risk (and shall hold Purchaser harmless from such risk due to
Purchaser being a registered shareholder during such period) and account, and
Sellers acknowledge and agree that Purchaser shall not be obligated to pay
the HON Shanghai Purchase Price until the Closing. From and after the Closing
Date until either the HON Shanghai Registration Date (in the event the HON
Shanghai Registration Date occurs after the Closing Date) or, in the event of
the occurrence of a HON Shanghai Determination Event, the date on which the
applicable parties consummate the re-acquisition of the HON Shanghai Equity
Interest in accordance with the terms of this  _Section 6.2(e)_ (such date,
the " _HON Shanghai Re-Acquisition Date_ "), Purchaser shall cause HON
Shanghai to conduct its business only in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice and use its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact
the assets of HON Shanghai (in each case, tangible and intangible), ordinary
wear and tear excepted, and relationships with employees and third parties
having material business dealings with HON Shanghai (it being understood that
in connection with any dispute regarding whether Purchaser complied with its
obligations under this sentence of this _Section 6.2(e)_, any decline in
revenues or profits of the business of HON Shanghai shall not in and
of itself be a breach of Purchasers obligation hereunder). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, except to the extent required to comply with
applicable Law, from and after the Closing Date until either the HON Shanghai
Registration Date (in the event the HON Shanghai Registration Date occurs
after the Closing Date) or, in the event of the occurrence of a HON Shanghai
Determination Event, the HON Shanghai Re-Acquisition Date, Purchaser shall
cause HON Shanghai to not terminate any HON Shanghai Employee or Transferred
China Employee without cause or take any of the actions with respect to the
business of HON Shanghai that are set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_, _6.1(f)_ ,
_6.1(g)_ , _6.1(h)_ , or  _6.1(l)_ , without Honeywells prior consent, which
will not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, in the event Honeywell or its designated Affiliate re-acquire
the HON Shanghai Equity Interests pursuant to this _Section 6.2(e)_, nothing
in _Section 6.14_ of

 



54  this Agreement shall be deemed to limit in any way the activities of (1)
Honeywell or its designated Affiliate with respect to the ownership of HON
Shanghai, or (2) the operation of the business of HON Shanghai (including the
manufacture, calibration, testing or sale of any products manufactured or sold
by or on behalf of HON Shanghai as of the Closing Date) in the same manner as
conducted prior to the Closing Date and in compliance with the terms of the
Joint Venture Agreement as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

(f) (i) To the extent HON China does not open the SAFE Special Bank Account
as of or prior to Closing: (A) HON China shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to open as promptly as practicable after Closing the SAFE Special Bank
Account to receive the HON Shanghai Purchase Price, (B) at Closing, Purchaser
shall wire the HON Shanghai Purchase Price to Honeywell, (C) within ten (10)
business days after the SAFE Special Bank Account has been opened, Honeywell
shall transfer an amount equal to the HON Shanghai Purchase Price to
Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to the wire
transfer instructions provided by Purchaser to Honeywell in writing prior to
such date, and Honeywell shall, on or prior to such date, provide wire
transfer instructions in writing to Purchaser in respect of the SAFE Special
Bank Account, and (D) within one (1) business day after the date on which
Purchaser receives the above-described amount equal to the HON
Shanghai Purchase Price from Honeywell, Purchaser shall wire an amount equal
to the HON Shanghai Purchase Price to the SAFE Special Bank Account pursuant
to the wire transfer instructions therefor provided by Honeywell to Purchaser
in writing prior to such payment, and (ii) to the extent HON China opens the
SAFE Special Bank Account as of or prior to Closing, Purchaser shall wire the
HON Shanghai Purchase Price to the SAFE Special Bank Account at the Closing
pursuant to the wire transfer instructions provided by Honeywell to Purchaser
in writing prior to such date.

6.3 Consents; Shared Agreements. 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.8_ and except as contemplated in _Section 6.2_,
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall each
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and authorizations
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including obtaining the consents and authorizations and making the filings
referred to in _Sections 5.3_ and _4.3_ , respectively.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the extent that any Contract
and/or Purchased Asset is not capable of being transferred by the Sellers to
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement without the consent of a third party, and
such consent is not obtained prior to Closing, or if such transfer or
attempted transfer would constitute a breach or a violation of the Contract or
any Law (each a " _Specified Consent_ "), nothing in this Agreement shall
constitute a transfer or an attempted transfer thereof. Sellers shall advise
Purchaser promptly and in writing with respect to any such Specified Consent
which Sellers know or have substantial reason to believe will not be assigned
to Purchaser hereunder.

 

(c) In the event that any such Specified Consent is not obtained on or prior
to the Closing Date, without limiting Sellers representations and warranties
or its obligations under this Agreement (including _Sections 6.2_, _6.3(a)_ ,
_6.7_ and _6.8_ ), until such Specified Consent is obtained, the Sellers shall
use commercially reasonable efforts (including after the Closing Date) to (i)
provide to Purchaser the benefits of the applicable Contract and/or

 



55  Purchased Asset, (ii) cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangement
designed to provide such benefits to Purchaser, and (iii) enforce at the
request and expense of Purchaser and for the account of Purchaser, any rights
of the Sellers arising from any such Contract and/or Purchased Asset (with any
out-of-pocket costs or expenses associated with such arrangements, to the
extent incremental to what Purchaser would be reasonably likely to bear if
such applicable Contract or Purchased Asset were assigned, to be borne by the
Sellers).

(d) To the extent that Purchaser is provided the benefits of any Contract
and/or Purchased Asset referred to in _Section 6.3(c)_, Purchaser shall
perform the obligations arising under such Contract for the benefit of the
Sellers and the other party or parties thereto, except for any obligation
under such Contract that constitutes an Excluded Liability.

(e) Once a Specified Consent is obtained, the applicable Contract and/or
Purchased Asset shall be deemed to have been automatically transferred to
Purchaser on the terms set forth in this Agreement with respect to the other
Contracts and Purchased Assets transferred and assumed at the Closing, and
consistent with the foregoing, the obligations pursuant to the applicable
Contract shall be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities, and the rights pursuant to
the applicable Contract shall be deemed to be Purchased Assets.

(f) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.3(c)_, Honeywell agrees
that it shall use commercially reasonable efforts in assisting Purchaser to
enter into customer or supplier agreements (each, a " _New Agreement_ "), as
applicable, with each counterparty (or an Affiliate thereof) to the Contracts
listed on  _Section 6.3(f)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Shared
Contracts_ "), for the products historically supplied to or from the Business
under such Shared Contracts (each product purchased or supplied thereunder,
a " _Shared Product_ "); provided that the Sellers shall not be required to
make any expenditures or incur any Liability in connection with assisting
Purchaser to obtain New Agreements. Until the earlier of (i) the date on
which Purchaser enters into a New Agreement with respect to any Shared
Products and (ii) (1) the eight (8) month anniversary of the Closing Date for
all Shared Contracts (other than the agreement(s) with ZMD currently in effect
with Honeywell relating to the purchase of Sleipnir, PTG7 and Gemini ASICs
(the " _ZMD Agreement_ ")) and (2) with regard to the ZMD Agreement, the
termination date of the ZMD Agreement (including with respect to renewals
thereof), provided that Sellers shall not take any affirmative action to
terminate and/or not renew or, subject to the last sentence of this _Section
6.3(f)_, modify, those portions of such ZMD Agreement that cover any ASICs or
related products that are used in Existing Products and have historically
been sourced through ZMD (including, without limitation, the Gemini, PTG7 and
Sleipnir ASICs) without Purchasers consent, Honeywell shall, to the extent
permitted under the relevant Shared Contract and in accordance with the terms
thereof (and, additionally, with respect to the ZMD Agreement, according to
the terms of the Confidential ASIC Technology Agreement and the Sleipnir
Support Agreement), source or distribute such Shared Products on behalf of
Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the applicable Shared Contract
(provided that Honeywell shall not be obligated to source or distribute any
product under the ZMD Agreement other than any ASICs or related products
that are used in Existing Products and have historically been sourced through
ZMD (including, without limitation, Sleipnir, PTG7 or Gemini ASICs)) and to
otherwise cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangement designed to
provide such benefits to Purchaser, and enforce at the request and expense of
Purchaser and for the account of Purchaser, any rights of the Sellers arising
from any Shared Contract and/or the

 



56  ZMD Agreement (with any out-of-pocket costs or expenses associated with such
arrangements, to the extent incremental to what Purchaser would be reasonably
likely to bear if such Shared Contract or ZMD Agreement were assigned, to be
borne by the Sellers), it being understood that Honeywell shall have no
Liability whatsoever for (A) any failure or delay in delivery of any Shared
Product to Purchaser or to the relevant customer (as the case may be), (B)
any failure of any Shared Product to comply with any product specification
provided by Purchaser or any customer of Purchaser (as the case may be), (C)
the condition of or defect in any Shared Product or any infringement of any
Intellectual Property right of any party by any Shared Product, in each case,
sourced, distributed or purchased by or for the Business, or (D) any other
Liability or Loss arising out of or in connection with any Shared Product
sourced, distributed or purchased by or for the Business, except, in each
case, for damages arising out of Honeywells gross negligence, wanton
disregard for its obligations under this _Section 6.3(f)_ or willful
misconduct; _provided_  that Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide Shared Products to be distributed by Honeywell under any
Shared Contract with a customer in a timely manner that enables Honeywell to
fulfill its obligations under such Shared Contract and, _provided_ _further_
, that Purchaser shall indemnify Honeywell for any direct damages arising out
of such Shared Contract relating to Shared Products sourced, distributed or
purchased by or for the Business, except for direct damages arising out of
Honeywells gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each of Purchaser and
Honeywell shall provide the other with reasonable access to the others
personnel, premises and documents as are necessary to fulfill its respective
obligations under this _Section 6.3(f)_, and shall promptly provide the other
with notice of any communications from the relevant counterparty to each
Shared Contract with respect to any Shared Product. Purchaser further
agrees to provide Honeywell written notice within five (5) business days
after it has entered into any New Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing herein shall limit or otherwise affect the Sellers rights and ability
to modify, amend, supplement or otherwise restructure the ZMD Agreement in a
manner that does not adversely alter the substantive terms, including economic
terms, under which ZMD supplies any ASICs or related products that are used in
Existing Products and have historically been sourced through ZMD (including,
without limitation, Gemini, PTG7 or Sleipnir ASICs); provided that all such
amendments, modifications or supplements shall be consistent and not conflict
with the terms of the Confidential ASIC Technology Agreement and the Sleipnir
ASIC Support Agreement.

(g) Subject to Sellers compliance with the covenants contained in this
Agreement (including in this _Section 6.3_ and in _Sections 6.2_ , _6.7_ and
_6.8_ ), Purchaser agrees that the failure to obtain any consent set forth on,
or not required to be set forth on, the Disclosure Schedules, or the failure
to enter into any New Agreement, shall not in and of itself (i) create any
Liability of the Sellers or (ii) constitute a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, or agreement of the Sellers contained herein, or the non-
satisfaction of any condition of Purchaser.

6.4 Confidentiality; Access to Information.

 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the information being Made Available to it by
the Sellers and their Affiliates (or their respective agents or
representatives) is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement dated
November 12, 2009 between Purchaser and Honeywell (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the confidentiality obligations of
Purchaser under the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate only with respect
to information

 



57  relating to the Business; and Purchaser acknowledges that any and all other
information provided or Made Available to it by the Sellers and their
Affiliates (or their respective agents or representatives) concerning the
Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Business) will remain subject to
the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing
and that any information provided by or on behalf of the Sellers and their
Affiliates pursuant to _Section 6.4(d)_ below will be subject to the terms
and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, each Seller shall, subject
to compliance with applicable Laws and any Contracts to which such Seller or
any of its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities) is a party, provide
Purchaser access and the opportunity to make such investigation of the
management, employees, representatives (including outside attorneys and
accountants), properties, businesses and operations of the Purchased
Assets and Purchased Entities, and such examination of the books, records and
other documents and the financial condition of the Business (including the
Purchased Entities), as it reasonably requests; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no Seller nor any of their Affiliates shall be required to disclose to
Purchaser or any agent or representative of Purchaser any information to the
extent it is advised by counsel that doing so would reasonably be expected to
result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of privilege
(including without limitation, the attorney-client and work product
privileges), unless Purchaser agrees to enter into a valid joint defense
agreement or similar arrangement to preserve such privilege, or to the extent
such disclosure would violate any applicable Law or contractual requirement (
_provided_ that the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain consents or approvals in order to disclose such information).
Any confidential information provided pursuant to this _Section 6.4(b)_
shall be kept confidential by Purchaser and will be subject to applicable Law,
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 6.4(a)_. Any
such investigation and examination will be conducted under reasonable
circumstances after appropriate advance notice and in a manner so as not to
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the Business. No investigation
pursuant to this  _Section 6.4(b)_ shall affect any representation or
warranty by the Sellers in this Agreement or any condition to the obligations
of Purchaser hereunder.

(c) As reasonably requested by Purchaser, from the date hereof until the
Closing, the Sellers shall provide Purchaser with such financial and other
information with respect to the Business and the Purchased Entities, to the
extent such information is reasonably available to Sellers, and access to
personnel of Sellers or any of their Affiliates and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide access to Sellers outside accountants and
other advisors, subject to customary indemnification agreements and other
customary requirements imposed by such accountants and other advisors, for
Purchaser to:

 

(i) identify the Purchased Assets with a view towards granting security
interests in such collateral after the Closing; and

(ii) consider whether Purchaser will need to prepare audited financial
statements of the Business in connection with any future offering memoranda,
registration statement, or periodic report prepared by Purchaser or its
Affiliates.

(d) Subject to Purchasers existing confidentiality obligations, and
Honeywells right to have Purchaser enter into a new confidentiality agreement
in respect of 

 



58  Seller information not related to the Business on terms reasonably
acceptable to Honeywell (which in any event will include customary carve-outs
for disclosure of confidential information as required by applicable Laws)
prior to complying with any terms of this _Section 6.4(d)_ (collectively, the
" _Confidentiality Obligations_ "), upon reasonable advanced written notice,
the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser
and its representatives with such financial and other information relating to
the Business (including information of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates
to the extent required by Regulation S-X (including Rules 3-05 and 3-10),
GAAP, IFRS or other applicable accounting standards (the " _Applicable
Requirements_ ")), to the extent such information is reasonably available to
Sellers or their Subsidiaries (the " _Carve-Out Financial Information_ "),
and shall otherwise reasonably cooperate with Purchaser, in each case as
reasonably requested by Purchaser and its Affiliates in order for Sensata NV
and its Subsidiaries to prepare and audit any financial statements
with respect to the Business, including in accordance with the Applicable
Requirements (the " _Carve-Out Financial Statements_ "). In furtherance of and
without limiting the foregoing, the parties agree as follows:

 

(i) Not more than thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, the
Sellers shall appoint an individual with an appropriate level of financial
expertise (the " _HON Audit Manager_ "), to serve as the principal point of
contact for Purchaser, its Affiliates, and its and their employees and other
representatives (including outside accountants and legal counsel) ("
_Purchaser Personnel_ ") with respect to the matters set forth in this
_Section 6.4(d)_. The HON Audit Manager will be fully dedicated to the tasks
required pursuant to this _Section 6.4(d)_ in order to coordinate and
respond to the requests of Purchaser Personnel which are made pursuant to this
_Section 6.4(d)_ and otherwise facilitate the Sellers compliance with their
obligations under this _Section 6.4(d)_. The HON Audit Manager will liaise
and coordinate as necessary and appropriate with chief financial officers,
site controllers, and other appropriate personnel or advisors (including
outside accountants and legal counsel) of Honeywell and its Subsidiaries ("
_Honeywell Personnel_ ") in response to the reasonable requests of Purchaser
Personnel under this _Section 6.4(d)_. To the extent the HON Audit Manager is
reasonably available, responsive, and cooperative, Purchaser and its
representatives shall address all requests for information, inquiries, and
other contact regarding the matters described in this _Section 6.4(d)_ to the
HON Audit Manager; provided that to the extent reasonably necessary or
appropriate in connection with the matters described in this _Section
6.4(d)_, the HON Audit Manager will arrange for, and the Purchaser Personnel
shall have, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, access to
appropriate Honeywell Personnel, subject to the Confidentiality Obligations
and, in the case of outside advisors, subject to customary indemnification and
confidentiality agreements and other customary requirements imposed by such
accountants or other advisors. 

(ii) At Purchasers reasonable request, Seller and Purchaser will cooperate
and use their commercially reasonable efforts to enable Purchaser to engage
audit personnel of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (" _PwC_ ") who have a history
of performing audit reviews for Honeywell (subject to Purchaser executing any
customary indemnification and confidentiality agreements and other customary
requirements imposed by PwC and reasonably acceptable to Purchaser) to assist
Purchaser with the review of the Carve-Out Financial Information, to conduct
an audit of the Carve-Out Financial Statements, and to perform any other
services otherwise required by Sensata NV or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with this _Section 6.4(d)_.

 



59 (iii) From the date of appointment of the HON Audit Manager through the date
of the Closing, the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide Carve-Out Financial Information, including pro forma financial
information of the type previously Made Available to Purchaser in respect of
the year ended December 31, 2009 (subject to the Confidentiality Obligations),
and shall otherwise reasonably cooperate with Purchaser Personnel as
reasonably requested by Purchaser and its Affiliates in order to analyze and
evaluate whether Sensata NV and its Subsidiaries will have a requirement to
prepare and audit any Carve-Out Financial Statements, and in order to enable
PwC to perform such audit procedures (including, if requested by PwC,
a physical inventory count at year-end) as would be required or requested by
PwC in connection with any audit of Carve-Out Financial Statements.

(iv) Upon Purchasers reasonable advanced written notice (at any time prior to
or after Closing) that it, as determined in its sole discretion, expects to
require Carve-Out Financial Statements (the " _Audit Assistance Request_ "),
the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Carve-Out
Financial Information (subject to the Confidentiality Obligations), and shall
otherwise reasonably cooperate with Purchaser Personnel as reasonably
requested by Purchaser and its Affiliates in order to prepare and audit the
Carve-Out Financial Statements, and in order to complete such preparation and
audit within applicable time frames under the Applicable Requirements. In
connection with the preparation of the Carve-Out Financial Statements, to the
extent that both Seller Personnel and Purchaser Personnel can, through the
exercise of their commercially reasonable efforts, accomplish the same
requirement or task, Purchaser shall cause Purchaser Personnel to perform
such requirement or task in order to avoid undue burden on Seller Personnel.

(v) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain representation letters and similar
documents from the applicable Seller Personnel as may be required in
connection with the preparation and audit of Carve-Out Financial Statements;
provided that such obligation shall be inapplicable to the extent that, in the
reasonable judgment of such personnel, the representations in such letter
or document are not factually accurate in all material respects. Subject to
Sellers compliance with the covenants of this _Section 6.4(d)_, Purchaser
agrees that the inability or failure, in whole or in part, of Sensata NV or
any of its Subsidiaries to obtain any such representation letters or similar
documents shall not in and of itself create any Liability on the part of the
Sellers or constitute a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Sellers contained in this Agreement.

(vi) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that
the costs and expenses incurred by Sellers or their Subsidiaries, and
personnel of Sellers or any of their Affiliates in providing Carve-Out
Financial Information and cooperating in the preparation of the Carve-Out
Financial Information shall be fully reimbursed by Purchaser at Sellers
actual cost.

 



60 (vii) The Sellers obligations under this _Section 6.4(d)_ shall terminate
upon the filing of a form 10-K by Sensata NV that includes its audited
financial statements for the calendar year after the calendar year in which
the Closing occurs, so long as the Sellers have complied with their
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4(d)_ through such date.

(e) From and after the date hereof until the Closing, Honeywell shall deliver
to Purchaser as soon as practicable after they become available a profit and
loss statement and statement of net assets for each month ending after the
date of the May 29, 2010 Balance Sheet, prepared from the books and records of
the Sellers (as it relates to the Business) and the Purchased Entities, as and
only to the extent customarily prepared in the ordinary course of business
consistent with Honeywells past practice.

6.5 Publicity. Honeywell shall not, and shall not permit the Sellers, the
Purchased Entities nor any of its or their Affiliates or representatives to,
and Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates nor their
respective representatives to, issue any press release or public announcement
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
obtaining the prior written approval of the other parties hereto, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless, in
the reasonable judgment of Honeywell or Purchaser, disclosure is otherwise
required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on
which any Seller or Purchaser lists its securities; _provided_ that, to the
extent required by applicable Law or by the rules of any stock exchange, the
party intending to make such release or announcement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such applicable Law to consult
with the other party with respect to the text thereof and, _provided_
_further_ , that no party shall be required to obtain consent pursuant to this
_Section 6.5_ to the extent any proposed release or announcement contains
information that has previously been made public without breach of the
obligations under this _Section 6.5_.

6.6 Books and Records.

 

(a) Honeywell will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to
be delivered to Purchaser at Closing all properties, books, records, copies
of checkbooks and cancelled checks, copies of Contracts, information and
documents relating primarily to the Business that are not then in the
possession or control of the Sellers or the Purchased Entities. As soon as
is reasonably practicable after the Closing, Honeywell will deliver or cause
to be delivered to Purchaser any remaining properties, books, records, copies
of Contracts, information and documents relating primarily to the Business
that are not already in the possession or control of the Sellers and the
Purchased Entities.

(b) Subject to _Section 8.2(a)_ (relating to the preservation of Tax
records), each of Honeywell and Purchaser agrees that it will preserve and
keep the books of accounts, financial and other records held by it relating to
the Business (including the Purchased Entities) (including accountants work
papers) for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date in accordance
with its respective corporate records retention policies; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that prior to disposing of any such records in accordance with
such policies (if such records would be disposed of prior to the tenth
anniversary of the Closing Date), the applicable party shall provide written
notice to the other party of its intent to dispose of such records and shall 

 



61  provide such other party the opportunity to take ownership and possession of
such records (at such other partys sole expense) to the extent they relate to
such other partys business or obligations within 30 days after such notice
is delivered. If such other party does not confirm its intention in writing to
take ownership and possession of such records within such 30-day period, the
party who possesses the records may proceed with the disposition of such
records. Each of Honeywell and Purchaser shall make such records and other
information relating to the Business (including the Purchased Entities),
employees and auditors available to the other as may be reasonably required
by such party (i) in connection with, among other things, any audit or
investigation of, insurance claims by, legal proceedings against, dispute
involving or governmental investigations of any Seller or Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates, or (ii) in order to enable any Seller or
Purchaser to comply with its respective financial reporting obligations or
obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and each other
agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, in either
case under reasonable circumstances after appropriate advance notice and in a
manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the providing partys
business, and subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in
_Sections 6.4_ and _6.15_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(1) Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with the Sellers and its counsel and
other representatives, make reasonably available its personnel, including the
Transferred Employees, and provide reasonable access to the books and records,
facilities, testing equipment and other assets relating to the Business
(including the Purchased Entities) as may be reasonably requested by Sellers
in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any matters set
forth on _Sections 4.9_ and _4.20_ of the Disclosure Schedule or other Third-
Party Claims, including a Third-Party Claim seeking a Product Recall, as to
which the Sellers have assumed the defense pursuant to _Section 10.3(b)_, and
(2) the Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and its counsel and
other representatives, make reasonably available its personnel, including the
non-Transferred Employees, and provide reasonable access to the books and
records, facilities, testing equipment and other Excluded Assets or Purchased
Entity Excluded Assets as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser
in connection with its defense, negotiation or settlement of any Third-Party
Claims, including a Third-Party Claim seeking a Product Recall (to the extent
not assumed by the Sellers pursuant to _Section 10.3(b)_).

 

6.7 Further Action. Except as set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_, the Sellers, on
the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall each use commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) take, or cause to be taken, all actions (within its
control) necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and (b) cause the fulfillment
at the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to the Purchasers
(in the case of the Sellers) and to the Sellers (in the case of Purchaser)
respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from time to time after the Closing Date, and for no further
consideration, each of the Sellers and Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver such assignments,
transfers, consents, assumptions and other documents and instruments and take
such other actions as may reasonably be necessary to appropriately consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including (i) transferring
back to Honeywell or any Seller or its designated Affiliates any asset or
Liability which was inadvertently transferred to, or held by, Purchaser at the
Closing, (ii) transferring to Purchaser any asset or Liability contemplated
by this Agreement to be transferred to Purchaser and which was not so
transferred at Closing, and (iii) remitting promptly

 



62  to Purchaser any cash amounts actually received for accounts receivable of
the Business generated at any time prior to or on or after the Closing Date.
The allocation of all Intellectual Property in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall
be governed by the principles embodied in _Sections 2.1(d)_ (with respect to
Intellectual Property licenses), _2.1(f)_ , _2.2(e)_ ,  _2.2(f)_ , _2.3(h)_ ,
_2.3(i)_ and _2.4(c)_ of this Agreement and by principles embodied in the
Intellectual Property License Agreement.

6.8 Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party hereto
incurring such expenses, except as expressly provided herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) Purchaser and the Sellers shall each pay one-half of any
and all fees and required to be paid under the HSR Act or any other foreign
merger control or foreign investment clearances required by Law to be obtained
in connection with the Closing and (b) Purchaser and the Sellers shall each
pay one-half of any and all out-of-pocket fees, expenses or other amounts
payable to third parties in connection with the matters and obligations set
forth in _Sections 6.2_, _6.3(a)_ and _6.7_.

6.9 Notification of Certain Matters. Each party shall give prompt written
notice to the other of the following:

(a) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event (including any breach of any
of its representations or warranties or a breach of any covenant or agreement
of such party) whose occurrence or nonoccurrence could reasonably be expected
to cause any of the conditions precedent set forth in _Article VII_ not to be
satisfied; and

(b) the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by any party or any of its
Affiliates from any Governmental Authority or other third party with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.10 Employees and Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) _Scope of Section_. This _Section 6.10_ contains the covenants and
agreements of the parties hereto with respect to the employment status of and
provision of employee benefits to the employees of the Sellers and their
Affiliates who are employed primarily in connection with the Business and to
the employees of the Purchased Entities, in each case, on the Closing Date,
including those individuals listed in _Section 6.10_ of the Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Employees_ ") and the provision of employee benefits under
the Company Plans to employees of the Purchased Entities and the Sellers who
terminate employment on the Closing Date with residual benefits under such
Company Plans. Nothing herein expressed or implied confers upon any current
or former employee, officer, director, contractor or agent of the Business
(including the Purchased Entities) any rights or remedies of any nature or
kind whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.10_. Employees
who accept Purchasers offer of employment and commence employment with
Purchaser as of the Closing, Employees whose rights and obligations arising
from their employment relationships shall pass over to Purchaser in connection
with the transfer of the Business by operation of Law and Employees of the
Purchased Entities who continue their employment with a Purchased Entity as of
the Closing, will (except as expressly provided in this _Section 6.10_) be
referred to as " _Transferred Employees_."

 



63 (b) _US Employees_. This _Section 6.10(b)_ applies only to Employees
employed in the United States (collectively, the " _US Employees_ ").

(i) Purchaser shall, by written offer of employment, offer to hire, effective
as of the Closing, the US Employees who are employed by the Sellers or their
Affiliates as of the Closing Date, who are listed in _Section 6.10(b)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule. Purchaser shall hire each US Employee who accepts
such offer. Sellers hereby agree that any current or former employee of the
Business (including any US Employee) who (A) as of the Closing Date is
receiving or entitled to receive short-term disability benefits and who
subsequently becomes eligible to receive long-term disability benefits, or (B)
as of the Closing Date is receiving or entitled to receive long-
term disability benefits shall become eligible or continue to be eligible, as
applicable, to receive such benefits under a disability benefit plan of
Sellers until such employee is no longer disabled. Upon written notice to
Purchaser that such employee has been released to return to active
employment, Purchaser shall, by written offer of employment, offer to hire
such employee effective on the date such employee is released to return to
work, provided that such release date occurs within six (6) months after the
Closing Date, and shall hire each such US Employee who accepts such offer. All
US Employees who accept Purchasers offer of employment and actually commence
employment with Purchaser on or after the Closing are referred to herein as "
_Transferred US Employees_." Terms of employment continuation for each
Transferred US Employee shall (1) initially be at the same work location, (2)
initially pay a base wage rate and provide cash incentive opportunities no
less than each such Transferred US Employees base wage rate and cash
incentive opportunities in effect as of the Closing Date, (3) initially
provide employee benefit plans (other than any equity-based compensation,
non-qualified deferred compensation, defined benefit pension plans and retiree
health benefits) that are not materially different than those provided to
similarly situated United States employees of Purchaser, except that
Purchaser shall provide severance benefits to Transferred US Employees as
described in _Section 6.10(b)(iii)_, and (4) initially provide other terms
and conditions of employment that are not materially different than those
provided to similarly situated United States employees of Purchaser.
Purchaser shall credit each Transferred US Employees service with the Sellers
and their respective Affiliates for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual, except that service
requirements for vacation or severance entitlements shall be credited) to the
extent credited under an analogous Company Plan as of the Closing Date, except
to the extent any duplication of benefits would result. 

(ii) Nothing in this Agreement shall, or shall be construed to, limit the
ability of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment of
any Transferred US Employee at any time and for any or no reason after the
Closing.

(iii) With respect to any Transferred US Employee whose employment is
involuntarily terminated other than for cause, as the term "cause" is defined
in Sellers severance plan set forth in  _Section 6.10(b)(iii)_ of the
Disclosure

 



64  Schedule, by Purchaser during the twenty-four (24)-month period beginning on
the Closing Date (including, but not limited to, the termination of a
Transferred US Employee because he refuses to accept a work relocation that
exceeds fifty (50) miles), Purchaser shall provide a severance benefit
(consisting of notice pay (if applicable), a lump sum severance payment and
subsidized COBRA continuation coverage (it being understood that with respect
to the subsidized COBRA continuation portion of the severance benefit,
Purchaser will provide subsidized COBRA continuation coverage as though
severance benefits paid to such Transferred US Employee had been paid over
time rather than in a lump sum)) that shall be substantially similar in value
to the severance benefit that such Transferred US Employee would have received
under the terms of the severance plan set forth in _Section 6.10(b)(iii)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule, calculated as though the Transferred US Employee
worked continuously for the Sellers or their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, until his termination date with Purchaser.

 

(iv) Each health benefit plan sponsored by Purchaser for the benefit of the
Transferred US Employees shall, where applicable, (A) in the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs waive any pre-existing condition limitation or
exclusion or any actively-at-work requirement that was waived or satisfied
under an analogous Company Plan as of the Closing Date, and (B) in the plan
year in which the Closing Date occurs credit all payments made by Transferred
US Employees for healthcare expenses under similar Company Plans during the
current plan year for purposes of deductibles, co-payments and maximum out-
of-pocket limits.

(v) On and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume and pay when due
all Liabilities of the Sellers relating to accrued wages, accrued cash
bonuses payable pursuant to the applicable management incentive plan (" _MIP_
") of the Sellers for the period from January 1, 2011 through the Closing (in
the event the Closing occurs after January 1, 2011), accrued cash bonuses
payable pursuant to the applicable sales incentive plan (" _SIP_ ) of the
Sellers, earned but unused vacation, and accrued leave, in each case, as of
the Closing Date with respect to Transferred US Employees, and in each case
(other than Liabilities in the nature of wages that would constitute Assumed
Liabilities pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ ), solely to the
extent reflected as a Liability in Final Net Working Capital. For the
avoidance of doubt, regardless of the date on which the Closing occurs, the
Sellers shall retain and pay when due the cash bonuses payable pursuant to the
MIP for calendar year 2010 to the Transferred US Employees who earned such
bonuses.

(vi) Purchaser shall provide the Transferred US Employees and their covered
beneficiaries with continuation coverage in accordance with Section 4980B of
the Code and/or Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA (" _COBRA_ ") as a result of
any "qualifying events" (as defined in Section 4980B of the Code) that occur
after the Closing Date.

(vii) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Transferred US Employees shall no
longer be eligible to (A) contribute to the health care flexible spending
account or accounts sponsored by the Sellers, except to the extent otherwise
provided by and in accordance with COBRA, or (B) contribute to the dependent
care

 



65  flexible spending accounts sponsored by the Sellers. As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause the account balances of all
Transferred US Employees under any defined contribution plan to become fully
vested in accordance with relevant plan provisions, and Sellers shall make to
any defined contribution plan maintained by any Seller all employee and
matching and any other employer contributions with respect to the Transferred
US Employees employment service rendered prior to the Closing. Following the
Closing Date, Sellers shall take all actions as are necessary or appropriate
to ensure that, under the terms of any 401(k) plan maintained by any
Seller in which Transferred US Employees participate, each Transferred US
Employee may elect to continue repayment of any outstanding loans for the
duration of the loan term.

(c) _Czech Republic Employees_. This _Section 6.10(c)_ applies only to
Employees employed in the Czech Republic by HON Czech Controls (" _Czech
Republic Employees_ "). 

(i) The parties understand and agree that after the Closing, contracts of
employment for Czech Republic Employees, including the individuals listed in
_Section 6.10(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, will, to the extent required by
applicable Law, remain in effect, and the Czech Republic Employees rights and
obligations arising from their employment relationships ( _i.e._ , the terms
and conditions of employment) will remain unchanged and unaffected by and
after the Closing unless changes are permitted by applicable Law or unless
Czech Republic Employees and HON Czech Controls mutually agree to amend or
terminate any of the contracts of employment for such Czech Republic
Employees.

 

(ii) Sellers represent that, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, _Section
6.10(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists all Czech Republic Employees;
however, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser agrees to continue to employ
all Czech Republic Employees, regardless of whether they are listed in
_Section 6.10(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. 

(iii) Purchaser or HON Czech Controls shall be solely responsible for any
amounts becoming payable to Czech Republic Employees under the statutory
severance plan or other applicable Laws as a result of their separation from
employment with Purchaser or HON Czech Controls at any time on or after the
Closing Date, notwithstanding that such amount must be calculated by
reference to periods of employment with HON Czech Controls and the Sellers and
their Affiliates prior to Closing as well as periods of employment with
Purchaser and HON Czech Controls after the Closing.

 

(iv) On and after the Closing Date, HON Czech Controls shall be obliged to pay
when due all Liabilities of the Sellers or HON Czech Controls relating to
accrued wages, accrued cash bonuses payable pursuant to the MIP for the period
from January 1, 2011 through the Closing (in the event the Closing occurs
after January 1, 2011), accrued cash bonuses payable pursuant to the SIP,
earned but unused vacation, and accrued leave as of the Closing Date with
respect to Czech Republic Employees, in each case (other than Liabilities in
the nature of wages that would constitute Assumed 

 



66  Liabilities pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ ), solely to the
extent reflected as a Liability in Final Net Working Capital. For the
avoidance of doubt, regardless of the date on which the Closing occurs, the
Sellers shall retain and pay when due the cash bonuses payable pursuant to the
MIP for calendar year 2010 to the Czech Republic Employees who earned such
bonuses.

 

(d) _Korea Employees_. This _Section 6.10(d)_ applies only to Employees

as of the Closing, the Korea Employees who are employed by the Sellers or
their Affiliates as of the Closing Date, who are listed in _Section 6.10(d)_
of the Disclosure Schedule. Purchaser shall hire each Korea Employee,
effective on the Closing Date, who accepts such offer. All Korea Employees
who accept Purchasers offer of employment and actually commence employment
with Purchaser on or after the Closing are referred to herein as "
_Transferred Korea Employees_." Terms of employment continuation for each
Transferred Korea Employee shall (1) initially be at the same work location,
(2) initially pay a base wage rate and cash incentive compensation no less
than each such Transferred Korea Employees base wage rate and cash incentive
compensation in effect as of the Closing Date, and (3) initially provide
employee benefit plans (other than any equity-based compensation, non-
qualified deferred compensation, and defined benefit pension plans) and other
terms and conditions of employment that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than those provided to the Korea Employees as of the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall credit each Transferred Korea Employees service with the Sellers
and their respective Affiliates for purposes of severance calculation
described in subsection A below, eligibility to participate, and vesting (but
not for purposes of benefit accrual or any other purpose under any defined
benefit plan, and not for any purpose under any equity-based or nonqualified
deferred compensation plan or arrangement) to the extent credited under an
analogous Foreign Plan as of the Closing Date, except to the extent any
duplication of benefits would result.

 

A. Purchaser shall be responsible for any amounts becoming payable to
Transferred Korea Employees under the statutory severance plan or Laws as a
result of their separation from employment at any time after the Closing,
notwithstanding that such amount must be calculated by reference to periods of
employment with HON Korea prior to Closing as well as periods of employment

Final Net Working Capital. For the avoidance of doubt, regardless of the date

the Closing unless changes are permitted by applicable Law or unless Shanghai
Employees and HON Shanghai mutually agree to amend or terminate any of the
contracts of employment for such Shanghai Employees.

 

(ii) Sellers represent that, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, _Section
6.10(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists all Shanghai Employees; however,
for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser agrees to continue to employ all
Shanghai Employees, regardless of whether they are listed in _Section
6.10(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, unless such Shanghai Employees
employment relationships are changed to the extent permitted by applicable Law
or unless Shanghai Employees and HON Shanghai mutually agree to amend or
terminate any of the contracts of employment for such Shanghai Employees.

who earned such bonuses.

 



68 (f) _HON China Employees_. This _Section 6.10(f)_ applies only to Employees
employed in China by HON China (" _China Employees_ ").

(i) Prior to Closing, the Sellers shall cause HON Shanghai, to offer, in a
manner and method that Sellers determine are appropriate, to the China
Employees positions that would allow such China Employees to transfer their
current employment relationships from HON China to HON Shanghai. Such offered
employment shall initially be at the same work location (Shanghai), initially
pay a base wage rate and cash incentive compensation no less than each
such China Employees base wage rate and cash incentive compensation in
effect as of the date immediately prior to such transfer, and initially
provide employee benefit plans and other terms and conditions of employment
that are no less than those provided to each such China Employee as of the
date immediately prior to such transfer.

(ii) If prior to Closing, the China Employees do not transfer to HON Shanghai
prior to Closing pursuant to _Section 6.10(f)(i)_, then the following
provisions will become applicable:

 

A. Purchaser shall cause HON Shanghai, by written offer of employment, to
offer to hire, effective as of the Closing, the China Employees who are
employed by HON China as of the Closing Date, who are listed in _Section

hire each China Employee, effective as of the Closing Date, who accepts such
offer. All China Employees who accept HON Shanghais offer of employment and
actually commence employment with HON Shanghai on or after the Closing are
referred to herein as " _Transferred China Employees_." Terms of employment
continuation for each Transferred China Employee shall (1) initially be at the
same work location (Shanghai), (2) initially pay a base wage rate and cash
incentive compensation no less than each such Transferred China Employees
base wage rate and cash incentive compensation in effect as of the Closing
Date, and (3) initially provide employee benefit plans (other than any equity-
based compensation, non-qualified deferred compensation, and defined benefit
pension plans) and other terms and conditions of employment that are not
materially different than those provided to similarly situated HON Shanghai
Employees as of the Closing Date. HON Shanghai shall credit each Transferred
China Employees service with HON China and its respective Affiliates for
purposes of severance calculation described in subsection (B) below,
eligibility to participate, and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual or any other purpose under any defined benefit plan, and not for any
purpose under any equity-based or nonqualified deferred compensation plan or
arrangement) to the extent credited under an analogous Foreign Plan as of the
Closing Date, except to the extent any duplication of benefits would result.

 



69 B. HON Shanghai shall be responsible for any amounts becoming payable to
Transferred China Employees under the statutory severance plan or Laws as a
result of their separation from employment at any time after the Closing,
notwithstanding that such amount must be calculated by reference to periods
of employment with HON China prior to Closing as well as periods of employment
with HON Shanghai after the Closing.

C. For the avoidance of doubt, HON China shall be responsible for any
severance amounts becoming payable to China Employees who are offered
employment by HON Shanghai, but who decline HON Shanghais offer of
employment. With respect to any China Employee who does not consent to the
transfer of his/her employment to HON Shanghai, and instead elects to be
terminated with severance (paid or to be paid by Sellers) and rehired by
Purchaser, Purchaser shall still cause HON Shanghai or one of its Affiliates
to offer to hire such employee per subsection (A) above. However, such China
Employee will not be credited with his/her service with HON China.

 

D. On and after the Closing Date, HON Shanghai shall assume and pay when due
all Liabilities of the Sellers relating to accrued wages, accrued cash
bonuses for the period from January 1, 2011 through the Closing (in the event
the Closing occurs after January 1, 2011), accrued cash bonuses payable
pursuant to the SIP, earned but unused vacation and accrued leave, in each
case, as of the Closing Date with respect to Transferred China Employees, and
in each case (other than Liabilities in the nature of wages that would
constitute Assumed Liabilities pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)(ii)_ or  _(iii)_
), solely to the extent reflected as a Liability in Final Net Working Capital.
For the avoidance of doubt, regardless of the date on which the Closing
occurs, the Sellers shall retain and pay when due the cash bonuses payable
pursuant to the MIP for calendar year 2010 to the Transferred China Employees
who earned such bonuses.

(g) Nothing contained in this  _Section 6.10_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit
or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) create any
third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person (including any
Transferred Employee) other than the parties to this Agreement, including with
respect to (x) any right to employment or continued employment or to a
particular term or condition of employment with Purchaser, the Purchased
Entities or any of their respective Affiliates and (y) the ability of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing Date, the
Purchased Entities) to amend, modify, or terminate any benefit
or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

6.11 Indebtedness; Intercompany Accounts.

(a) No later than the Closing Date, (i) Honeywell shall discharge

70  Purchased Entities owed to any Person other than another Purchased Entity,
and (ii) Honeywell shall, or shall cause Sellers or their applicable
Subsidiaries to, terminate or cancel any and all intercompany accounts and

Disclosure Schedule) between any of Honeywell or its Subsidiaries (other than
any of the Purchased Entities), on the one hand, and any of the Purchased
Entities, on the other hand.

(b) To the extent that (i) any obligations of the Business (including the
Purchased Entities) are secured by a letter of credit/bank guarantee or
guarantee by Honeywell or any of its Affiliates (other than the Purchased
Entities), Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates on or prior to the Closing Date to be
substituted for Honeywell or any of its Affiliates (other than the Purchased
Entities), as applicable, with respect to (and cause Honeywell or such
Affiliate to be released from) the financial and performance guarantees
provided by Honeywell or any of its Affiliates relating to such obligation,
and (B) cause to be issued letters of credit/bank guarantees as replacement
letters of credit/bank guarantees for ones issued by Honeywell or its
Affiliates (collectively, " _Honeywell L/Cs_ ") on or prior to the Closing
Date and to use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Honeywell
L/Cs cancelled or terminated and (ii) any obligations of Honeywell or its
Affiliates (other than the Purchased Entities) are secured by a letter of
credit/bank guarantee or guarantee by the Purchased Entities, Honeywell shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause Honeywell or one of its
Affiliates (other than the Purchased Entities) on or prior to the Closing Date
to be substituted for the Purchased Entities, as applicable, with respect to
(and cause the Purchased Entities to be released from) the financial and
performance guarantees provided by any Purchased Entity relating to such
obligation, and (B) cause to be issued letters of credit/bank guarantees as
replacement letters of credit/bank guarantees for ones issued by any
Purchased Entity (collectively, " _Purchased Entity L/Cs_ ") on or prior to
the Closing Date and to use commercially reasonable efforts to have Purchased
Entity L/Cs cancelled or terminated; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that to the
extent such guarantees cannot be extinguished or such letters of credit/bank
guarantees cannot be replaced or terminated on or prior to the Closing, (x)
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to do so as promptly as
practicable following the Closing and shall indemnify and hold Honeywell and
its Affiliates (other than the Purchased Entities) harmless from and against
any and all Losses resulting from any payment after the Closing Date by any
of Honeywell or its Affiliates (other than the Purchased Entities) under the

classification, Purchaser or such Affiliate will be entitled to rely on such
persons response without Liability under this _Section 6.13(b)_ in
connection with any untrue statements made by 

 



72  such person; _provided_ , _further_ , that (i) Purchaser or such Affiliate
has no Knowledge that such persons response is false or untrue and (ii) in
the event that at any time Purchaser obtains Knowledge that such persons
response was false or untrue, then Purchaser or such Affiliate shall promptly

The restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.14(a)_ shall not be construed
to prohibit or restrict the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates
from acquiring any Person or business that engages in any Competing Business
except to the extent that the Competing Business involves the manufacture,

reasonable efforts to divest that portion of such Person or business that
engages in the Prohibited Acquired Entity Activities (the " _Prohibited
Portion_ ") within nine (9) months after its acquisition of the Prohibited

inducement to, the acquisition by Purchaser of the Purchased Assets.

(d) The Sellers acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any breach,
or threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this _Section 6.14_ will
be inadequate and, accordingly, the Sellers covenant and agree that Purchaser

at Law, be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, and to
the remedy of specific performance with respect to any breach or threatened
breach of such covenant, as may be available from any court of competent
jurisdiction. In addition, the Sellers and Purchaser agree that the terms of
the covenant in this _Section 6.14_ are fair and reasonable in light of
Purchasers plans for the Business and are necessary to accomplish the full
transfer of the goodwill and other intangible assets contemplated hereby. In
the event that any of the covenants contained in this _Section 6.14_ shall be
determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any
reason whatsoever, then any such provision or provisions shall not be deemed
void, and the parties hereto agree that said limits may be modified by the
court and that said covenant contained in this _Section 6.14_ shall be
amended in accordance with said modification, it being specifically agreed by
the parties that it is their continuing desire that this covenant be enforced

information (collectively, the " _Business Confidential Information_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, the term Business Confidential Information shall not
include information to the extent it (i) does not relate to the Business, (ii)
becomes available to the Sellers or any of their Affiliates on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than Purchaser or, after the Closing,

the Purchased Entities) (a " _Post-Closing Representation_ ") and (b) their
rights of attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between
such counsel and any such stockholder, officer, employee or director,
occurring during the Current Representation in connection with any Post-

the foregoing shall be construed to restrict certain advisors, including
accountants and attorneys, that have represented and continue to represent the
Sellers and their Subsidiaries from continuing to represent Purchaser and its
Affiliates, including in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in accordance with the terms and conditions of any conflict
waiver or similar documents entered into between the Sellers and such

Purchaser in no way deviates from the manner and placement of historical use
of such Sellers Marks; and (B) Purchaser cannot feasibly discontinue such
usage without replacement of tool, die, or mold components during such
production run), and (ii) Purchaser shall not take any action or omit to take
any action which may reasonably be expected to derogate, erode or tarnish the
Sellers Marks, or otherwise diminish the value of the Sellers Marks or
impair the goodwill associated with the Sellers Marks. Purchaser shall in
any event phase out such use of such tools, dies and molds as soon as is
reasonably practicable, and, in particular, shall if practicable remove the
cast for such marks from each such tool, die or mold on the first occasion
after the Closing Date when such tool, die or mold is refurbished. Except as
expressly provided in this _Section 6.18_, such limited license shall
terminate six (6) months after the Closing Date regardless of whether any
tool, die or mold has been refurbished; and all use by Purchaser of Sellers
marks in any manner shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, promptly
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall take all steps within Purchasers
control or ability to change the names of the Purchased Entities to names not
containing the word "Honeywell"; _provided_ , however, that with respect to

Ltd.", Purchaser shall have a limited license until the effective time of the
name change, so long as until the effective time of the name change, it
restricts use of such name to those uses that cannot be substituted for an
alternative name due to applicable Chinese Law. All use of Sellers Marks as
permitted hereunder shall inure to the benefit of the Sellers.

not to take, or permit any other Person on their behalf to, initiate or engage
in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any
Person (other than Purchaser and its representatives) concerning any merger or
recapitalization involving the Purchased Entities, sale of Equity Interests,
any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Business or similar
transaction involving the Business or any of the Purchased Entities (other
than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business). The

 



77  Sellers shall, and shall cause the Purchased Entities and their officers,
directors, agents and representatives to, terminate any and all negotiations
or discussions with any third party regarding any proposal concerning any
merger or recapitalization involving the Purchased Entities, sale of Equity

limitations, notify Purchaser if any formal written offer for the purchase of
all or substantially all of the Business is received by Honeywell from a third
party.

effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, which come due as a result of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including any stay or transaction
bonuses.

6.21 Compliance with Letter Agreements. Purchaser and the Sellers shall comply
in all respects with the terms and conditions of the letter agreements, as may

deliver duly executed counterparts of, a mutually acceptable HTT Supply
Agreement at Closing, then for a period of five (5) years following the
Closing (which period may be extended if mutually agreed to by the parties),
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, fulfill all purchase orders
received from HTT (up to the top projected volumes and pursuant to the sensor
pricing Schedule included in _Section 6.23_ of the Disclosure Schedule) with
respect to the sensor products set forth in _Section 3.3(a)(vii)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt, mutual agreement on an HTT
Supply Agreement shall not be a condition to either Sellers or Purchasers
respective obligations to consummate the Closing.

the other party so requests, to allow the other party to take possession of
such books and records. 

(b) Purchaser and the Sellers further agree, upon request, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby).

 

(c) With respect to any Tax Return described in _Section 8.1(b)_ as to which
an amount of Tax is allocable to, or would otherwise be borne by, the Sellers
or any of their Subsidiaries (other than the Purchased Entities), Purchaser
shall provide the Sellers with a pro forma draft of the portion of such Tax
Return (including all necessary supporting schedules and information)
reflecting only the tax items of the Business (including the Purchased
Entities) at least 30 days prior to the due date (including any extension
thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return, and the Sellers and their
authorized representatives shall have the right to review and comment on such
Tax Return (including any supporting schedules or information) prior to the
filing of such Tax Return. Any such comments shall be provided to Purchaser at
least 10 days prior to such due date.

(d) With respect to any Tax Return described in _Section 8.1(a)_ that relate
to the Purchased Entities and are filed after the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall provide Purchaser with a pro forma draft of such Tax Return (including
all necessary supporting schedules and information) reflecting only the tax
items of the Business (including the Purchased Entities) at least 30 days
prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of

 



81  such Tax Return, and Purchaser and its authorized representatives shall have
the right to review and comment on such Tax Return (including any supporting
schedules or information) prior to the filing of such Tax Return. Any such
comments shall be provided to the Sellers at least 10 days prior to such due
date. Purchaser shall at its own cost and expense fully and accurately
complete and submit any Tax data packages required by the Sellers within the
time periods established by the Tax Department of Honeywell reasonably
consistent with past practices.

 

(e) Each party shall have the right to conduct and control in its sole and
absolute discretion any audit or dispute with any Taxing Authority relating
to any Tax Returns it has the responsibility to file pursuant to this _Article
VIII_; _provided_ that (i) the Sellers shall consult with, and give reasonably
participation rights to, Purchaser with respect to the handling of any audit
or dispute involving a Tax Return the Sellers have the responsibility to file
pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_ if such audit or dispute would be reasonably
expected to result in an increase in Tax Liability of Purchaser or a
Purchased Entity, and the Sellers shall not settle any such audit or dispute
without the consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (ii) Purchaser shall consult with,
and give reasonably participation rights to, the Sellers with respect to the
handling of any audit or dispute involving a Tax Return that Purchaser has the
responsibility to file pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ if such audit or dispute
would be reasonably expected to result in an increase in Tax Liability of any
Seller or any Person that files a consolidated federal income Tax Return
together with any Seller (and any state, local or foreign consolidated,
unitary or combined Tax Return), or in any Liability for which the Sellers
have agreed to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to _Section 8.4_, and Purchaser
shall not settle any such audit or dispute without the consent of the Sellers,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If
either party receives a notice of audit or claim for Taxes relating to any Tax
Return that the other party has the responsibility to file pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ , the party receiving the notice or claim shall promptly
forward a copy thereof to the other party.

8.3 Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
relating to the sharing, allocation or indemnification of Taxes, or surrender
of reliefs, with respect to or involving the Business, the Purchased Assets,
or Purchased Entities shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after
the Closing Date, Purchaser, any of its Affiliates, and the Purchased Entities
shall not be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder.

8.4 Tax Indemnifications.

(a) The Sellers shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold Purchaser
and the Purchased Entities harmless against, Losses related to the following
Taxes (except to the extent specifically reflected as a Liability in the
computation of the Final Net Working Capital): (i) Taxes imposed (A) on the
Purchased Entities or (B) with respect to the Business or on the ownership or
operation of the Purchased Assets, in each case, with respect to taxable
periods ending before the Closing Date; (ii) with respect to taxable periods
beginning before the Closing Date and ending on or after the Closing Date (the
" _Straddle Period_ "), Taxes imposed (A) on the Purchased Entities, or (B)
with respect to the Business or on the ownership or operation of the
Purchased Assets, in either case which are allocable, pursuant to _Section
8.4(c)_, to the portion of such period ending on the day immediately prior to
the Closing Date, and (iii) Taxes of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates
(other than the Purchased Entities),

 



82  but excluding any Taxes imposed on the ownership of the Purchased Assets,
whether arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise, for any and all Tax periods. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary above, with respect to any Straddle Period, any actions taken by the
Purchased Entities outside the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date
but on or before the Closing shall be deemed to occur in the portion of such
period ending on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date for purposes of
this _Section 8.4(a)_.

(b) The Sellers shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold Purchaser
and the Purchased Entities harmless against, any successor or transferee
Liability or other secondary or other non-primary Liability imposed on
Purchaser, any of its Affiliates, and, following the Closing, any of the
Purchased Entities or Purchased Assets as a result of transactions or events
occurring (including those contemplated by this Agreement), or contracts
or agreements entered into, prior to the Closing Date, or as a result of any
Purchased Entity or Purchased Asset being part of or owned by, or ceasing to
be part of or owned by, an affiliated, combined, consolidated, unitary, or
other similar group prior to the Closing (including any Liability for the
unpaid Taxes of any Person under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6, or any
similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. law).

 

(c) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to the Straddle Period,
the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible, including
wages or payments to other person) (other than conveyances pursuant to this
Agreement), deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable
year ended on day immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ any items determined on an annual or periodic basis (including
amortization and depreciation deductions) shall be allocated to the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date by
multiplying such amounts by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the day immediately
prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period; and

 

(ii) in the case of Taxes other than those described in paragraph (i), deemed
to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the day immediately
prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.

Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle
Period shall be prorated based upon the method employed in this _Section
8.4(c)_ taking into account the type of the Tax to which the refund relates.
In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth
or long term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be

 



83  allocated under this _Section 8.4(c)_ shall be computed by reference to the
level of such items on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date. All
determinations necessary to effect the foregoing allocations shall be made in
a manner consistent with past practice of the Sellers.

(d) If Purchaser or a Purchased Entity receives any credit or a refund of
Taxes (excluding VAT imposed with respect to the transfer of the Purchased
Assets) imposed with respect to the Business (including the Purchased
Entities) (i) for any taxable period ending prior to the Closing Date, or
(ii) which are allocable, pursuant to _Section 8.4(c)_, the portion of a
Straddle Period ending prior the Closing Date, except to the extent any such
credit or refund of Taxes (A) is specifically reflected as an asset in the
computation of Final Net Working Capital, (B) solely with respect to the
Purchased Entities, results in any amount of Tax that the Sellers are not
required to indemnify Purchaser for under this Agreement, or (C) solely with
respect to the Purchased Entities, arises as a result of the carryback of a
loss or credit from a loss from a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning on
or after the Closing Date, then Purchaser shall promptly pay or cause to be
paid such amount (net of reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred to obtain the
refund) to the relevant Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser and the
Purchased Entities shall be entitled to waive any carryback of a loss or
credit from a Tax period beginning on or after the Closing Date to the extent
permitted by Tax Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Sellers make no representation, warranty or guaranty that
any of the Purchased Entities have or will have any Tax losses or Tax credits
for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending before the Closing Date that
will carry forward to any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning on or
after the Closing Date.

 

8.5 Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest, but
excluding any value added Tax) (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall be borne
50% by Purchaser and 50% by the Sellers. Notwithstanding anything in _Section
8.1_ to the contrary, any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with
Transfer Taxes shall be prepared by the party primarily or customarily
responsible under applicable local Law for filing such Tax Returns, and such
party will provide such Tax Returns to the other party for such other partys
review and approval at least ten (10) days prior to the date such Tax Returns
are due to be filed. Each party shall promptly pay all Transfer Taxes to
which it is responsible pursuant to this _Section 8.5_.

8.6 VAT.

 

(a) The Sellers and Purchaser intend that and agree to use all reasonable
endeavors to secure that the transfer of Purchased Assets pursuant to this
Agreement is treated as neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services for
the purposes of any value added tax (" _VAT_ ").

(b) If nevertheless any VAT is payable on the transfer of the Purchased Assets
under this Agreement then Purchaser shall pay to the applicable Seller the
amount of that VAT (excluding any interest and penalties imposed) within five
(5) business days of demand by the Sellers provided that the applicable Seller
shall issue to the Purchaser a valid VAT invoice in respect of that VAT.

 



84 (c) If and to the extent Purchaser is unable to recover the VAT paid under
_Section 8.6(b)_ above from the Taxing Authorities within the later of (i)
the customary recovery period or (ii) three (3) months from the date of
payment under  _Section 8.6(b)_, such non-recovered VAT shall be treated as
a Transfer Tax for purposes of this Agreement and borne by the parties in a
manner consistent with _Section 8.5_. If the claim to recover such VAT
results in a VAT audit by any Taxing Authority, the customary recovery period
shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, the time necessary for such audit
to conclude. To the extent any such non-recovered VAT is treated as a Transfer
Tax and the VAT is subsequently recovered by Purchaser after the Sellers have
borne their share of such VAT, Purchaser shall pay over to the Seller 50% of
any such recovered VAT, but in no event shall such payment exceed the amount
paid by the Sellers to Purchaser with respect to such VAT.

8.7 Check the Box Elections. The Sellers shall have the right to make an
election under Treas. Reg. Sec. 301.7701-3, effective prior to the Closing,
for each Purchased Entity to be disregarded as an entity separate from its
owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such elections shall be filed on
or before the Closing Date and Honeywell shall provide Purchaser with true
and accurate copies of all such elections on or before the Closing Date.

8.8 Wage Reporting. The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to utilize, or cause
their respective Affiliates to utilize, the standard procedure set forth in
Revenue Procedure 2004-53 with respect to wage reporting.

TERMINATION

9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the
Closing Date as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Sellers and Purchaser;

(b) by the Sellers or Purchaser on or after April 30, 2011, if the Closing
shall not have occurred by the close of business on such date, _provided_ that
the breach by the terminating party in any material respect of any of its
covenants or other obligations hereunder shall not be the principal cause of
the failure of the Closing to occur by such date; and

(c) by the Sellers or Purchaser if there shall be in effect a final
nonappealable Governmental Order restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

9.2 Effect of Termination and Abandonment. In the event of termination of this

of no effect with no Liability on the part of any party hereto (or any of its
Affiliates or representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto from any Liability for damages
resulting from any willful and intentional breach of this Agreement and (b)
the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
survive any termination of this Agreement.

 



85 ARTICLE X

Warranty) shall survive for four (4) years after the Closing. All covenants
and agreements contained herein which by their terms contemplate actions or
impose obligations following the Closing shall survive the Closing and remain
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. All covenants and
agreements contained herein which by their terms contemplate full performance
at or prior to the Closing shall terminate upon the Closing, except that
claims for indemnification in respect of any breach thereof shall survive
until the date that is one (1) year after the Closing Date. The period of time
a representation or warranty or covenant or agreement survives the Closing
pursuant to this _Section 10.1_ shall be the " _Survival Period_ " with
respect to such representation or warranty or covenant or agreement. In the
event notice of any claim for indemnification under this  _Article X_ shall
have been given within the applicable Survival Period and such claim has not
been finally resolved by the expiration of such Survival Period, the
representations or warranties or covenants or agreements that are the subject
of such claim shall survive, but only to the extent of and in the amount of
the claim as made prior to the expiration of the Survival Period, until such
claim is finally resolved.

 

10.2 Indemnification. Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set
forth in this _Article X_, from and after the Closing Date:

(a) The Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Purchased Entities) and each of their
respective officers, directors, members, managers and employees (collectively,
the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any Losses that are
imposed on or incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out of
(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Sellers in
_Article IV_, (ii) any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the
Sellers set forth in this Agreement, or (iii) the Excluded Liabilities.

(b) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their
Affiliates (other than the Purchased Entities) and each of their respective
officers, directors,

 



86  members, managers and employees (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against any Losses that are imposed on or incurred by
Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Purchaser in _Article V_, (ii) any failure
to perform any covenant or agreement of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement,
(iii) the conduct and operation of the Business (including the Purchased
Entities) from and after the Closing, or (iv) the Assumed Liabilities.

(c) For purposes of determining whether a breach or a violation of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement has occurred, each representation
or warranty in this Agreement will be read and construed to include all
materiality, "in all material respects," Material Adverse Effect and other
qualifiers expressly set forth in the applicable representation or warranty.
However, the determination of the amount of a Loss resulting from a breach of
any representation or warranty of the Sellers contained in this Agreement
shall be made by disregarding and not giving effect to any qualifiers as to
"Business Material Adverse Effect," "materiality," "material Loss" or "in all
material respects," or words of similar import, or, in the case of _Section
4.6(c)_, the dollar threshold used in such representation or warranty, and
instead interpreting such representation or warranty as if such terms were
deleted.

 

10.3 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) In order for a party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this _Article X_ in respect of a claim
made against the Indemnified Party by any Person who is not a party to this
Agreement (such claim, excluding any claims related to Taxes the procedures
for which are covered in _Section 8.2(d)_, a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party hereunder (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of the Third-Party Claim promptly following
receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third-Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying
Party, promptly following the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third-Party Claim, other than those notices
and documents separately addressed to the Indemnifying Party.

(b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim which relates to any
Losses, including a Product Recall, indemnifiable hereunder and to select
counsel of its choice; _provided_ that, unless otherwise expressly agreed in
writing by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall only be
entitled to control the defense of the Third-Party Claim if (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall acknowledge in writing its obligation to indemnify
the Indemnified Party for any and all Losses thereto (subject to the
provisions set forth in this Agreement), (ii) the Third-Party Claim does not
seek to impose on the Indemnified Party injunctive or other non-monetary
relief, (iii) the Third-Party Claim does not involve any material customer or
material supplier of the Indemnified Party (except to the extent Losses
arising from such Third-Party Claim constitute Excluded Liabilities, in which
case the Indemnifying Party shall (subject to satisfaction of clauses (i) and
(ii) above) be entitled to control the defense of a Third-Party Claim that
involves such a material customer or material supplier), (iv) the Third-Party
Claim does not involve any 

 



87  executive officer or key employee of the Indemnified Party, and (v) at the
time the Indemnifying Party receives notice of the Third-Party Claim, as a
result of the application of the applicable cap amount set forth in _Section
10.4(a)_, the indemnification payments reasonably expected to be made by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third-Party Claim are less than the
reasonably expected indemnifiable Loss of the Indemnified Party as a result
of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ that it is specifically agreed and
acknowledged amongst the Parties that the Sellers shall control, defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with each of the Third-Party
Claims relating to the matters reflected on _Sections 4.9_ and _4.20_ of the
Disclosure Schedule. If the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to as a result
of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of the previous sentence, or does
not within 30 days of its receipt of notice of a Third-Party Claim pursuant to
_Section 10.3(a)_ elect to or otherwise fails to defend against or negotiate
any Third-Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnifiable hereunder,
the applicable Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim except that, in the event the
Indemnifying Party is not entitled to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such a Third-Party Claim as a result of the application
of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of the previous sentence, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
such Third-Party Claim, including with respect to a Product Recall, upon
reasonable request, to meet with the Indemnified Party or their
representatives to discuss such Product Recall, and to have the reasonable
opportunity to participate in any negotiation, settlement or other
discussions that the Indemnifying Party has with the party bringing such
Third-Party Claim, any other party related to such Third-Party Claim, or any
of their respective representatives, at its own cost and expense, and in no
event will the Indemnified Party have the right to settle any such Third-
Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall cooperate with Sellers in connection with any
testing, analyses and other support services that are conducted in connection
with or in relation to any actual or proposed Product Recall pursuant to which
Purchaser may seek indemnification under  _Section 10.2(a)(i)_. If the
applicable Indemnified Party defends any Third-Party Claim, then the
Indemnifying Party shall promptly reimburse the applicable Indemnified Party
for the out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with the investigation, defense and/or
settlement of any such Third-Party Claim upon submission of periodic bills. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim,
the applicable Indemnified Party may participate, at its own expense, in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
applicable Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in any such
defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i)
so requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the applicable Indemnified Party, a conflict
or potential conflict exists between the applicable Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party that would make such separate representation advisable
(each of clause (i) and (ii), a " _Reimbursable Participation_ "); _provided_
, _further_ , that Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay for more
than one (1) such counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any
Third-Party Claim; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in any Third-Party Claim
where an Indemnified Party is not controlling the defense and which involves
any customer or supplier of the Business, such participation shall include the
right of the Indemnified Party to engage in direct discussions with the other
parties to the Third-Party Claim, including discussions concerning the claim
and potential resolution thereof, subject to paragraph (c) below and subject
to the following two sentences. Notwithstanding anything

 



88  herein to the contrary, the participation of the Indemnified Party in any
discussion relating to the Third-Party Claim shall not alter any of the rights
of the controlling party to control and direct the defense of such Third-
Party Claim, including the right to accept or reject any resolution proposed
by the non-controlling party in such controlling partys sole discretion. In
connection with any discussions by an Indemnified Party with any parties to a
Third-Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall, and in the case of a
Purchaser Indemnified Party the Purchaser hereby agrees to cause such
Indemnified Party to (i) fully disclose to all other parties that (A)
the non-controlling party is acting on its own behalf and not as a
representative of the controlling party, and (B) the non-controlling party is
not authorized to agree to any settlement with respect to such Third-Party
Claim; and (ii) keep confidential any non-public information relating to the
Sellers or the Third-Party Claim.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall (and shall cause the other applicable
Indemnified Parties to) cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof at
reasonable times upon reasonable notice and without undue disruption of the
Indemnified Partys business, and the Indemnified Partys actual out-of-pocket
costs in such cooperation shall be indemnifiable Losses hereunder, except that
the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to make any payments with
respect to fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party so
long as the Indemnifying Party continues to defend such Third-Party Claim
(other than as set forth in _Section 10.3(b)_ in respect of a
Reimbursable Participation). If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall (and shall cause the other
applicable Indemnified Parties to) agree to any settlement, compromise or
discharge of a Third-Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party may recommend
and that (i) by its terms unconditionally obligates the Indemnifying Party (or
its Affiliates) to pay the full amount of the Liability in connection with
such Third-Party Claim, (ii) does not require any payment or other action by
any Indemnified Party, and (iii) unconditionally releases all Indemnified
Parties in connection with such Third-Party Claim; it being understood that in
no other event will the Indemnifying Party have the right to settle any
Third-Party Claim, regardless of whether the defense thereof has been assumed
by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, the applicable Indemnified Parties shall not
admit any Liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(d) In the event any Indemnified Party has a claim against any Indemnifying
Party under this _Article X_ that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver written notice of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party promptly following the Indemnified Party becoming aware of
the same. The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
Liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party under this _Article X_,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced
by such failure.

 

10.4 Indemnification Limitations.

(a) In no event shall the Sellers be liable for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)(i)_ (other than in respect of the representations and
warranties in _Section 4.1_ (Corporate Status), _Section 4.2_ (Authority),
the first two sentences of each of _Section 4.4(a)_ and

 



89   _4.4(b)_ (Capitalization), _Section 4.7_ (Taxes), and _Section 4.21_
(Finders Fee) (collectively, the " _Excluded Representations_ ") and 
_Section 4.17_ (Sufficiency of Assets)) unless and until the aggregate amount
of all Losses with respect to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ that are imposed on or
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties exceeds $1,400,000 (the "
_Threshold Amount_ "), in which case the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to indemnification for all Losses from the first dollar, including
both the Threshold Amount and any amounts in excess thereof.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Sellers shall not (i) be
required to make payments for indemnification pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)(i)_ (other than in respect of the Excluded Representations) in an
aggregate amount in excess of $18,000,000 (the " _Indemnification Cap_ "), or
(ii) be liable for indemnification with respect to any Loss by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ (other than in respect
of the Excluded Representations) to the extent such Loss and all Losses
arising out of the same facts and circumstances are, in the aggregate, less
than $15,000 (each, a " _De Minimis Loss_ ") (and such Losses shall be
disregarded and shall not be aggregated for purposes of the Threshold Amount
unless and until such Losses arising out of the same facts or circumstances
exceed the De Minimis Loss amount). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Sellers shall have ninety (90) days after the receipt of an
indemnification claim for any Loss by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in
respect of _Section 4.20(b)_ (Products Liability; Warranty) in which to
propose a commercially reasonable alternative to satisfy such
claim, including the repair, replacement or redelivery of any products that
are the subject of such claim, which such commercially reasonable alternative
is subject to the prior written approval of the Purchaser Indemnified Party,
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (it being understood
that any and all costs or other Losses imposed on or incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties arising out of such alternative shall, subject to the
terms, conditions and limitations contained herein, be considered
indemnifable Losses). Purchaser shall not be required to make payments for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2(b)(i)_ in an aggregate amount in
excess of the Indemnification Cap.

 

(b) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party hereunder, the
amount of any indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of
any other Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made or could be
made under any other representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement and
shall be computed net of (i) payments recovered by the Indemnified Party
under indemnification agreements or arrangements with third parties or under
any insurance policy with respect to such Losses (after deduction for any cost
of collection, deductible, retroactive premium adjustment, reimbursement
obligation or other cost or expense directly related thereto) (each, a "
_Collateral Source_ "), (ii) any prior recovery by the Indemnified Party from
any Person with respect to such Losses, including by such Loss being included
as a Liability in Final Net Working Capital and actually resulting in an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.4(f)_, or (iii) any
Tax Benefit actually received by a Purchased Entity with respect to such
Losses in the year of the indemnity payment or a prior year, but increased by
the amount of any Tax detriment actually paid by any Indemnified Party as a
result of such partys receipt of the indemnification payment with respect to
such Loss. In the event of any indemnification claim paid, Honeywell may, in
its sole discretion, require the Indemnified Party to grant to Honeywell an
assignment of the right of such Indemnified Party to assert a claim against
any Collateral Source. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment
required under this _Article X_ or _Article VIII_ is determined after
payment of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party
under this _Article X_ or _Article VIII_, the 

 



90  Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such
determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to
pay pursuant to this _Article X_ or _Article VIII_ had such determination
been made at the time of such payment.

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article X_, but notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, (i) in no event shall the Sellers or
Purchaser be liable for any punitive damages, except to the extent such
damages are payable to an unaffiliated third party and (ii) in no event shall
the Sellers be liable for any consequential damages (it being understood and
agreed that the term "consequential damages" used herein shall not include
damages related to lost profits, diminution in value (including multiple of
earnings or similar metrics for measuring damages), nor damages payable to an
unaffiliated third party) arising out of indemnification claims for Excluded
Liabilities described in  _Sections 2.5(a)(iv)_, _(v)(A)_ , _(vii)(B)_ ,
_(ix)_ , _(x)_ , _(xi)_ , _(xii)_ , and _(xiv)_ and _Section 2.5(b)(vi)_
(each such indemnification claim, a " _Business Related Excluded Liabilities
Claim_ ") in excess of $28,000,000; _provided_ that the foregoing limitation
on consequential damages shall not apply to the extent any such Excluded
Liability relates to the Excluded Assets, the Purchased Entities Excluded
Assets, or operation or conduct by the Sellers or any of their Affiliates of
any business (other than the Business). Purchaser and the Sellers shall, and
Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to, in good
faith, (x) agree upon what portion of damages (if any) constitute
consequential damages in connection with the settlement of a Business Related
Excluded Liabilities Claim and (y) use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Governmental Authority to
determine what portion of damages (if any) constitute consequential damages as
part of any Governmental Order that is entered by such Governmental Authority
in connection with a Business Related Excluded Liabilities Claim.

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
after the Closing, indemnification and specific performance pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article X_, _Section 6.14_ and _Article VIII_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties with respect to any and all
claims (whether in contract or in tort) arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (other than remedies set forth in the Ancillary Agreements
with regard to the transactions contemplated thereby), including in respect
of any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or other
provision contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, as a
material inducement to the Sellers entering into this Agreement, Purchaser
hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any claim or cause of action, known
and unknown, foreseen and unforeseen, which it or any of the other Purchaser
Indemnified Parties may have against any Seller or any of its Affiliates,
including without limitation under the common law or federal or state
securities Laws, trade regulation Laws or other Laws (including any relating
to Intellectual Property, products liability (including Products Liability
Claims), Tax, environmental, real estate or employee matters), by reason of
this Agreement and the transactions provided for herein, except for claims or
causes of action brought under and subject to the terms and conditions of the
provisions contained in this _Article X_ and _Article VIII_. All payments
made pursuant to this _Article X_ and _Article VIII_ shall be made by
the Sellers to Purchaser or by Purchaser to the Sellers, as the case may be,
and shall be deemed to be adjustments to the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this _Article X_ shall limit any
claim by a Purchaser Indemnified Party alleging that Sellers defrauded such
Person by intentionally

 



91  omitting or misstating any disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule where such
omission or misstatement constitutes a breach in any material respect of any
express representation or warranty, which claims shall, in any case, be
subject to the provisions of _Sections 4.23_, _5.7(a)_ - _(d)_ , _11.7_ and
_11.8_.

(e) The Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the other parties
would be damaged irreparably in the event any provision of this Agreement is
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise is breached,
so that a party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof. In particular, the parties acknowledge that the Business
is unique and recognize and affirm that in the event that the Sellers breach
this Agreement, money damages would be inadequate and Purchaser would have no
adequate remedy at law, so that Purchaser shall have the right, in addition to
any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to enforce its rights
and the Sellers obligations hereunder not only by action for damages but also
by action for specific performance, injunctive, and/or other equitable relief.

writing signed by all parties hereto. Any waiver of rights hereunder must be
set forth in writing. A waiver of any breach or failure to enforce any of the
terms or conditions of this Agreement shall not in any way affect, limit or
waive any partys rights at any time to enforce strict compliance thereafter
with every term or condition of this Agreement.

11.5 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective legal
representatives and successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement shall not be assigned by any party hereto by
operation of Law or otherwise without the express written consent of each of
the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the consent of the
other parties hereto Purchaser may (i) assign its right to purchase the
Purchased Assets or the Purchased Entities, in whole or in part, to one or
more of its Affiliates, (ii) assign its rights hereunder to the lenders under
the Credit Agreement, dated April 27, 2006 (as amended), among Sensata
Technologies, B.V., Sensata Technologies Finance Company, LLC, Sensata
Technologies Intermediate Holding B.V., each lender from time to time party
thereto and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as collateral security, and
(iii) assign its rights hereunder to a third party in connection with a sale

such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations hereunder. 

11.6 Disclosure Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule shall be construed with and
as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if the same had
been set forth verbatim herein. Any matter disclosed pursuant to the
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or representation
as to the materiality of the item so disclosed.

 

11.7 Governing Law. Any and all claims, disputes or controversies in any way
arising out of or relating to (a) this Agreement, (b) any breach, termination
or validity of this Agreement, (c) the transactions contemplated hereby or (d)
any discussions or communications relating in any way to this Agreement or
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Transaction Matters_ "), and the
existence or validity of any and all defenses to such claims, disputes or
controversies, shall be governed and resolved exclusively by the Laws of the
State of New York, notwithstanding the existence of any conflict of laws
principles that otherwise would dictate the application of any other states
Law. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right to object to
the application of New York Law or argue against its applicability to any of
the matters referenced in the immediately preceding sentence.

11.8 Dispute Resolution; Mediation; Jurisdiction.

(a) In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim in any way arising out
of or relating to the Transaction Matters (a " _Dispute_ "), upon the written
notice of any party hereto, the parties hereto shall attempt to negotiate a
resolution of the Dispute. If the parties hereto are unable for any reason to
resolve a Dispute within 30 days after the receipt of such notice, the
Dispute shall be submitted to mediation in accordance with _Section 11.8(b)_.

 



94 (b) Any Dispute not resolved pursuant to _Section 11.8(a)_ shall, at the
request of any party hereto (a " _Mediation Request_ "), be submitted to non-
binding mediation in accordance with the then current CPR Mediation Procedure
(the " _Procedure_ "), except as modified herein. The mediation shall be held
in New York, New York. The parties shall have 20 days from receipt by a party
(or parties) of a Mediation Request to agree on a mediator. If no mediator
has been agreed upon by the parties within 20 days of receipt by a party (or
parties) of a Mediation Request, then any party may request (on written notice
to the other parties), that the CPR appoint a mediator in accordance with
the Procedure. All mediation pursuant to this clause shall be confidential
and shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations, and no oral or
documentary representations made by the parties during such mediation shall be
admissible for any purpose in any subsequent proceedings. No party hereto
shall disclose or permit the disclosure of any information about the evidence
adduced or the documents produced by the other parties in the mediation
proceedings or about the existence, contents or results of the mediation
without the prior written consent of such other parties except in the course
of a judicial or regulatory proceeding or as may be required by Law or
requested by a Governmental Authority or securities exchange. Before making
any disclosure permitted by the preceding sentence, the party intending to
make such disclosure shall give the other parties reasonable written notice of
the intended disclosure and afford the other party a reasonable opportunity to
protect its interests. If the Dispute has not been resolved within 60 days of
the appointment of a mediator, or within 90 days of receipt by a party (or
parties) of a Mediation Request (whichever occurs sooner), or within such
longer period as the parties may agree to in writing, then any party may file
an action on the Dispute in any court having jurisdiction in accordance with
_Section 11.8(c)_.

(c) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York located in New
York City and the courts of the United States of America located in New York
City for any litigation arising out of or relating to the Transaction Matters
(and agrees not to commence any litigation relating to the Transaction Matters
except in such courts), and further agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to its respective address
set forth in _Section 11.1_ shall be effective service of process for any
litigation brought against it in any such court. Each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any litigation arising out of the Transaction Matters in the courts of the
State of New York located in New York City or the courts of the United States
of America located in New York City and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such litigation brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION
WITH ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE TRANSACTION
MATTERS.
