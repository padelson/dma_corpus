ARTICLE  III

 

 

_EFFECT  OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_

 

 

§3.1 _Conversion  of Stock_.  At the  Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part  of  any party, each share of
Merger Sub's common stock issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into and exchanged  for  one validly
issued, fully paid, and nonassessable share of the Surviving  Corporation's
common stock. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing  ownership of
any such shares will from and after the Effective Time evidence  ownership of
shares of the Surviving Corporation's common stock, so that, after  the
Effective Time, Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued and 
outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation's common stock. Each share
of  Target Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective  Time (other than any shares of Target Common Stock that are held
in the treasury  of Target or held by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, all
of which shall  cease  to be outstanding and be canceled and none of which
shall receive any payment  with respect thereto) and all rights in respect
thereof shall, by virtue of  the  Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, forthwith  cease  to exist and be converted into and
represent the right to receive an amount,  in  cash and shares of Parent
Preferred Stock, equal to  (x) $701,500,000, _minus_   Actual  Net Debt,
_plus_   or  _minus_ ,  as the  case may be, the Actual Closing Working
Capital Adjustment, _plus_   or  _minus_ **** as  the  case may be, the
Actual Closing CapEx Adjustment, _minus_   the  amount of Actual Closing
Transaction Expenses (collectively, the " _Merger  Consideration_ ") 
_divided_ _by_   (y) the number of shares of Target Common Stock issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares
of Target Common  Stock which are held in the treasury of Target or held by
Parent or any of  its  Subsidiaries, all of which shall cease to be
outstanding and be canceled and  none of which shall receive any payment with
respect thereto).

 

 

§3.2 _Effect  on Options_.  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
options issued under the Target  Option Plans (other than the Specified
Options) that are outstanding on such  date will be cancelled and will cease
to exist, and the holder of such option  will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive  a pro rata portion of the
Merger Consideration. For the avoidance of the doubt,  for purposes of this
Agreement, the Pro Rata Portion of the Target Stockholders  shall be
calculated as if the Specified Options were exercised for cash  immediately
prior to the Effective Time such that shares of Target Common Stock  issuable
upon the exercise thereof shall be deemed issued and outstanding as  of  the
Effective Time and the Target Stockholders and the Specified Option holders 
shall receive a pro rata portion of the Merger Consideration; _provided_ , 
that in  determining the Pro Rata Portion of any Specified Option holder the
aggregate  exercise price for all such options shall be taken into 
consideration.

§3.3 _Delivery  of Funds; Surrender of Certificates; Payments_.  (a) At 
least three (3) Business Days, but not more than five (5) Business  Days,
prior to the Closing Date, Target shall deliver to Parent a statement 
(the " _Closing  Estimate Statement_ ")  setting forth Target's good faith
estimate of (i) the amount  of Net Debt of Target as of the Closing Date (the
" _Estimated  Net Debt_ "),  (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated
Net Debt is greater  or less than the Target Net Debt (the " _Estimated  Net
Debt Adjustment_ "),  (iii) the Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "
_Estimated  Working Capital_ "),  (iv) the amount, if any, by which the
Estimated Working Capital exceeds  the Working Capital Upper Limit or is less
than the Working Capital Lower  Limit, as  the case may be (the "
_Estimated  Working Capital Adjustment_ ," which,  if the Estimated Working
Capital is less than the Working Capital Lower Limit, the Estimated Working
Capital Adjustment shall be deemed a negative amount,  and  if Estimated
Working Capital is between the Working Capital Upper Limit and the  Working
Capital Lower Limit, the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment shall  be 
$0.00), (v) its consolidated Capital Expenditures for the period commencing 
on January 1, 2008 and ending on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated  CapEx
Expenditures_ "),  (vi) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated CapEx
Expenditures  is greater or less than the Cumulative Adjusted Capex Budget
Amount for  the period commencing on January 1, 2008 and ending on the
Closing Date  (the " _Estimated  CapEx Expenditures Adjustment_ "), ****
(vii) the  amount of Transaction Expenses as of the Closing Date (the "
_Estimated  Transaction Expenses_ "),  (viii) the total number of
outstanding shares of Target Common Stock,  and (ix) Estimated Merger
Consideration, which shall quantify in reasonable  detail the foregoing
amounts and calculations, and in each case shall be  calculated in accordance
with _Section 1.1  (d)_  of the  Target Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(b) On  the  Closing Date (or at such later date when a Target Stockholder
surrenders such  Target Stockholder's Certificate(s)), upon surrender by a
Target Stockholder to  Parent of the certificate(s) representing the shares
of Target Common Stock  held  by such Target Stockholder immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each, a  " _Certificate_ ")  and  delivery of a
letter of transmittal in form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to
Parent and the Target Stockholders Representative from each  Target
Stockholder who did not sign the Joinder Agreement containing the 
appropriate provisions of the Joinder Agreement, Parent shall pay to the
Target  Stockholders the Estimated Merger Consideration as follows:

 

 

(i) if  the  Estimated Merger Consideration is equal to or less than
$154,000,000, then  each  such Target Stockholder who has surrendered a
Certificate shall receive a number  of shares of Parent Preferred Stock equal
to (w) the Estimated Merger  Consideration, (x) _minus_   the  Escrow
Amount, (y) _divided_ _by_   $18.00  (as adjusted for stock splits and
combinations), and (z) _multiplied_ _by_   the Pro  Rata Portion of such
Target Stockholder (rounded to the nearest whole share);  or

 

 

(ii) if  the  Estimated Merger Consideration is greater than $154,000,000,
then each such  Target Stockholder who has surrendered a Certificate shall
receive (x) a  number of shares of Parent Preferred Stock equal to (I)
$154,000,000  _minus_   the  Escrowed Parent Preferred Stock Value, (II)
_divided_ _by_   $18.00  (as adjusted for stock splits and combinations),
and (III) _multiplied_ _by_   the Pro  Rata Portion of such Target
Stockholder (rounded to the nearest whole share),  and (y) an amount in cash
equal to (I) the Estimated Merger  Consideration _minus_   $154,000,000
_minus_   the  Escrowed Cash, and (II) _multiplied_ _by_   the Pro  Rata
Portion of such Target Stockholder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Until  so  surrendered, each Certificate shall be deemed, for all
corporate purposes,  to  evidence only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration  deliverable in respect thereof to which
such Person is entitled pursuant to  this  Article III. No interest shall be
paid or accrued in respect of such cash  payments. If the Merger
Consideration (or any portion thereof) is to be  delivered to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificates  surrendered in exchange
therefor are registered, it shall be a condition to  the  payment of such
portion of the Merger Consideration that the Certificates so  surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock  powers and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting  such
transfer pay to the Surviving Corporation any Transfer Taxes payable by 
reason of the foregoing or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving 
Corporation that such Transfer Taxes have been paid or are not required to 
be  paid. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed,  upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such  Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving
Corporation will  issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the portion  of  the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof as determined in  accordance with this Article III; _provided_ , 
that  the Person to whom such portion of the Merger Consideration is paid
shall,  as a  condition precedent to the payment thereof, indemnify the
Surviving Corporation  in a manner reasonably satisfactory to them against
any claim that may be made  against the Surviving Corporation with respect to
the Certificate claimed to  have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

 

(d) At  the  Closing, the Escrowed Cash and Escrowed Parent Preferred Stock
shall be  deposited with the Escrow Agent to be held by the Escrow Agent in
accordance  with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

 

(e) At  the  Closing, Parent shall pay or purchase, on behalf of Target and
its Subsidiaries,  to or from the holders of the Indebtedness of Target
included in the calculation  of Estimated Net Debt (including the Mezzanine
Notes and the Target Credit  Agreements), other than to the holders of the
Remaining Indebtedness, reflected  in the Payoff Letters an amount sufficient
to repay all such Indebtedness,  with  the result that immediately following
the Closing there will be no further  monetary obligations of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries  with respect to such Indebtedness.

 

 

(f) At  the  Closing, Parent shall pay, on behalf of Target and its
Subsidiaries, the  Estimated Transaction Expenses as set forth in the Closing
Estimate Statement,  by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant
to written instructions  provided to Parent by Target concurrently with the
delivery of the Closing  Estimate Statement.

 

 

§3.4 _Determination  of Merger Consideration Adjustment_.  (a)  Promptly 
after the Closing Date, and in any event not later than ninety (90) days 
following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall prepare and
deliver  to the Target Stockholder Representative a statement (the "
_Closing  Statement_ ")  setting forth the Surviving Corporation's good
faith calculation of (i) the  amount of Net Debt of Target as of the Closing
Date (the " _Closing  Net Debt_ "),  (ii) the amount, if any, by which the
Closing Net Debt is greater or less  than the Target Net Debt (the "
_Closing  Net Debt Adjustment_ "),  (iii) the Working Capital as of the
Closing Date (the " _Closing  Working Capital_ "),  (iv) the amount, if any,
by which the Closing Working Capital exceeds the  Working Capital Upper Limit
or is less than the Working Capital Lower Limit,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  may be (the " _Closing  Working Capital Adjustment_ ," 
which,  if the Closing Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Lower
Limit,  the  Closing Working Capital Adjustment shall be deemed a negative
amount, and if  Closing Working Capital is between the Working Capital Upper
Limit and the  Working Capital Lower Limit, the Closing Working Capital
Adjustment shall be  $0.00), (v) the consolidated Capital Expenditures for
the period  commencing on January 1, 2008 and ending on the Closing Date (the
" _Closing  CapEx Expenditures_ "),  (vi) the amount, if any, by which the
Closing CapEx Expenditures  is greater or less than the Cumulative Adjusted
Capex Budget  Amount for the period commencing on January 1, 2008 and
ending  on the Closing Date (the " _Closing  CapEx_ ** __**_Expenditures 
Adjustment_ "),  (vii) the Transaction Expenses as of the Closing Date  (the
" _Closing  Transaction Expenses_ "),  (viii) the total number of
outstanding shares of Target Common Stock, and  (ix) the Estimated Merger
Consideration based  on foregoing amounts (the  " _Closing  Merger
Consideration_ "),  which  shall quantify in reasonable detail the
foregoing  amounts and calculations, and  in each case shall be calculated
in accordance  with _Section 1.1(d)_  of the  Target Disclosure Letter.
Upon delivery of the Closing Statement by the  Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide the Target  Stockholder Representative
with reasonable access to the books and records  of  the Surviving
Corporation and Target, as the case may be, and any other document  or
information reasonably requested by the Target Stockholder Representative, 
in  order to allow the Target Stockholder Representative to verify the
accuracy  of  determination by the Surviving Corporation of the Closing
Merger  Consideration.

 

 

 

(b) In  the  event that the Target Stockholder Representative does not
object to any amounts  set forth on the Closing Statement by written notice
of objection (the " _Notice  of Objection_ ")  delivered to the Surviving
Corporation within fifteen (15) Business Days  after the Target Stockholder
Representative's receipt of the Closing Statement,  such Notice of Objection
to set forth in reasonable detail the Target  Stockholder Representative's
alternative calculations of (i) the amount of  Closing Net Debt, (ii) the
Closing Net Debt Adjustment, (iii) the  Closing Working Capital, (iv) the
Closing Working Capital Adjustment,  (v) the Closing CapEx Expenditures, (vi)
the Closing CapEx  Expenditures Adjustment, (vii) the amount of Closing
Transaction Expenses,  (viii) the total number of outstanding shares of
Target Common Stock, or  (ix) the Closing Merger Consideration based on such
amounts, the Closing  Merger Consideration shall be deemed final and binding
and shall be the Merger  Consideration for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

 

(c) If  the  Target Stockholder Representative delivers a Notice of
Objection to the  Surviving Corporation within the fifteen (15) Business Day
period referred  to in Section 3.4(b), then (A) any amount included in the
Surviving  Corporation's calculation of Closing Merger Consideration that is
not in dispute  on the date such Notice of Objection is given shall be
treated as final and  binding and (B) any dispute (all such disputed amounts,
the " _Disputed  Amounts_ ")  shall  be resolved as follows:

 

 

(i) the  Target Stockholder Representative and the Surviving Corporation
shall promptly  endeavor in good faith to resolve the Disputed Amounts listed
in the Notice  of  Objection. In the event that a written agreement
determining the Disputed  Amounts has not been reached within ten (10)
Business Days after the date  of receipt by the Surviving Corporation from
the Target Stockholder  Representative of the Notice of Objection, the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolution  of such Disputed Amounts shall be submitted to
PriceWaterhouseCoopers (other  than its New York office) (the " _Arbitrator_
");

 

 

(ii) the  Arbitrator shall conduct its own review and verification of the
Closing  Statement and shall select either the Target Stockholder
Representative's  calculations of the Disputed Amounts or the Surviving
Corporation's calculations  of the Disputed Amounts or an amount in between
the two;

 

 

(iii) the  Target Stockholder Representative and the Surviving Corporation
shall use all  commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Arbitrator to
render a decision  in  accordance with this Section 3.4(c) along with a
statement of reasons  therefor within thirty (30) days of the submission of
the Disputed Amounts,  or a reasonable time thereafter, to the Arbitrator.
The decision of the  Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon each party
hereto and the decision  of  the Arbitrator shall constitute an arbitral
award that is final, binding and  non-appealable and upon which a judgment
may be entered by a court having  jurisdiction thereover;

 

 

(iv) in  the  event the Target Stockholder Representative and the Surviving
Corporation submit  any Disputed Amounts to the Arbitrator for resolution,
the Surviving Corporation  and the Target Stockholders shall each pay their
own costs and expenses incurred  under this Section 3.4(c). The Target
Stockholders shall be responsible for  that fraction of the fees and costs of
the Arbitrator equal to (A) the  Arbitrator's final determination with
respect to the Disputed Amounts, over  (B) the absolute value of the
difference between the Target Stockholder  Representative's aggregate
position with respect to the Disputed Amounts and the  Surviving
Corporation's aggregate position with respect to the Disputed Amounts,  and
the Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for the remainder of such 
fees and costs; and

 

 

(v) the  Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based upon the
provisions  of  this Section 3.4(c), only the Disputed Amounts and the
determination of  each amount of the Disputed Amounts shall be made in
accordance with the  procedures set forth in Section 3.4(a) and, in any event
shall be no less  than the lesser of the amount claimed by either the
Surviving Corporation or  the  Target Stockholder Representative, and shall
be no greater than the greater  of  the amount claimed by either the
Surviving Corporation or the Target Stockholder  Representative.

 

 

(d) Upon  the  determination, in accordance with Sections 3.4(b) or 3.4(c),
of the final  calculations of the amounts of (i) Closing Net Debt, (ii) the
Closing  Net Debt Adjustment, (iii) Closing Working Capital, (iv) the
Closing  Working Capital Adjustment, (v) Closing CapEx Expenditures, (vi)
the  Closing CapEx Expenditures Adjustment, (vii) Closing Transaction
Expenses,  (viii) the total number of outstanding shares of Target Common
Stock, and  (ix) the Closing Merger Consideration, then, the Closing Merger 
Consideration shall be recalculated using such finally determined amounts in 
lieu of the amounts set forth on the Closing Merger Statement and such
amounts  as so recomputed in accordance with Sections 3.4(b) or 3.4(c) are
referred  to herein as (I) " _Actual  Net Debt_ ",  (II) the " _Actual 
Net Debt Adjustment_ ",  (III) " _Actual  Closing Working Capital_ ", 
(IV) the " _Actual  Closing Working Capital Adjustment_ ",  (V) " _Actual 
Closing CapEx Expenditures_ ",  (VI) the " _Actual  Closing CapEx_

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

_Expenditures  Adjustment_ ",  and  (VII) " _Actual  Closing Transaction
Expenses_ ",  and  the determination of the Merger Consideration based on
such amounts shall be  final and binding and shall be the Merger
Consideration for all purposes of  this  Agreement. If the Merger
Consideration is greater than the Estimated Merger  Consideration, then the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay to  the  Target Stockholders
in accordance with Section 3.4(e) such deficiency  within three (3) Business
Days of the determination of the Merger  Consideration. If the Merger
Consideration as finally determined is less than  the Estimated Merger
Consideration, then the Target Stockholders shall be  obligated to pay the
Surviving Corporation such deficiency in accordance with  Section 3.4(f)
within three (3) Business Days after the determination  of the Merger
Consideration. The amount payable by the Surviving Corporation  or  the
Target Stockholders pursuant to this Section 3.4(d) is referred to  herein as
the " _Merger  Consideration Adjustment_ ".

 

 

(e) If  the  Merger Consideration as finally determined is greater than the
Estimated Merger  Consideration and:

 

 

(i) if  the  Merger Consideration is less than or equal to $154,000,000,
then Parent shall  issue to the Target Stockholder Representative (for
further distribution to  the  Target Stockholders based on their respective
Pro Rata Portions) a number of  shares of Parent Preferred Stock equal to the
Merger Consideration Adjustment  _divided_ _by_   $18.00  (as adjusted for
stock splits and combinations); or

 

 

(ii) if  the  Merger Consideration is greater than $154,000,000, and then if
the Estimated  Merger Consideration was (x) less than $154,000,000, then
Parent will issue  to  the Target Stockholders a number of shares of Parent
Preferred Stock equal  to  (i) $154,000,000 _minus_   the  Estimated
Merger Consideration _divide_ d  _by_   (ii)  $18.00 (as adjusted for stock
splits and combinations) and pay to the Target  Stockholders an amount in
cash equal to the Merger Consideration _minus_   $154,000,000, or (y) greater
than $154,000,000, then Parent will pay to the  Target Stockholders an amount
in cash equal to the Merger Consideration  Adjustment.

 

 

(f) If  the  Merger Consideration as finally determined is less than the
Estimated Merger  Consideration and:

 

 

(i) if  the  Merger Consideration Adjustment exceeds the Escrow Amount, then
the Surviving  Corporation and the Target Stockholder Representative shall
instruct the Escrow  Agent to release to the Surviving Corporation the
Escrowed Cash, if any, and  the  Escrowed Parent Preferred Stock, and each
Target Stockholder shall be required  to, at its option, (A) pay to the
Surviving Corporation an amount in cash  in immediately available funds equal
to its Pro Rata Portion of the excess  of  the Merger Consideration
Adjustment over the Escrow Amount then held by the  Escrow Agent or (B)
return to the Surviving Corporation a number of shares  of Parent Preferred
Stock equal to its Pro Rata Portion of the amount by which  the Merger
Consideration Adjustment exceeds the Escrow Amount then held by  the  Escrow
Agent _divided_ _by_   $18.00  (as adjusted for stock splits and
combinations), which shares shall be canceled  by the Surviving Corporation
and deemed authorized but unissued shares of Parent  Preferred Stock; or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) if  the  Escrow Amount then held by the Escrow Agent equals or exceeds
the Merger  Consideration Adjustment, then the Surviving Corporation and the
Target  Stockholder Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release
to the  Surviving Corporation (A) if the Escrowed Cash then held by the
Escrow  Agent exceeds the Merger Consideration Adjustment, then an amount in
cash equal  to the Merger Consideration Adjustment, or (B) if the Merger
Consideration  Adjustment exceeds the Escrowed Cash then held by the Escrow
Agent, then the  Escrowed Cash then held by the Escrow Agent plus a number of
shares of Parent  Preferred Stock equal to the excess of the Merger
Consideration Adjustment  or  the Escrowed Cash then held by the Escrow
Agent _multiplied_ _by_   $18.00  (as adjusted for stock splits and
combinations) the Merger Consideration  Adjustment over the Escrowed Cash.

 

 

Notwithstanding  the foregoing, in the event that the foregoing provisions of
this _Section  3.4_   require  the release of Parent Preferred Stock to
Parent, the Stockholders Representative  may elect upon the final
determination of the Merger Consideration Adjustment  to  substitute a cash
payment in an amount equal to the number of shares of Parent  Preferred
Stock, or any portion thereof, that would otherwise be released to  Parent,
multiplied by $18.00 (as adjusted for stock splits and combinations)  and 
upon such payment those shares for which cash was so substituted shall
instead  be released to the Stockholders Representative.

 

 

§3.5 _No  Further Rights of Transfers_.  At and  after the Effective Time,
each Target Stockholder shall cease to have any rights  as a stockholder of
Target, except as otherwise required by applicable Law  and  except for the
right of each Target Stockholder to surrender his or her  Certificate or lost
Certificate affidavit in exchange for payment of the  applicable merger
consideration, and no transfer of Target Common Stock shall  be  made on the

amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this  Agreement to any Person such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold  with respect to the making

not individually  or  in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a

exists no default or event, occurrence,  condition or act (including the
purchase of the Shares hereunder) which, with  the giving of notice or the
lapse of time would become a default under such  lease, other than defaults
which, would not individually or in the aggregate  be  reasonably expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Target.  Neither Target nor
any of its Subsidiaries has violated any of the terms or  conditions under
any such lease except as would not individually or in the  aggregate be

employer  welfare arrangement," within the meaning of Section 3(40) of 
ERISA.

 

 

(e) Except  as  set forth on _Section  4.21(e)_   of the  Target

and having unfunded liabilities, and, except as required by applicable Laws 
or  for death benefits or retirement benefits under any "employee benefit
pension  plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), neither
Target  nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to provide any such
benefits  to  any retired or former employees or active employees following
such employees' retirement or termination of service. Except as would not
individually or in  the  aggregate be reasonably expected to result in any
material and adverse impact  on  Target and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, neither Target nor any of its  Subsidiaries has any unfunded

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liabilities  pursuant to any Employee Benefit Plan that is not intended to be
qualified  under  Section 401(a) of the Code.

 

 

(f) Except  as  would not individually or in the aggregate be reasonably
expected to result  in  any material and adverse impact on Target and its

benefits and appeals of denied routine claims); no civil  or  criminal
action brought pursuant to the provisions of Title I, Subtitle B,  Part  5
of ERISA is pending, or, to the Knowledge of Target, threatened,

Subsidiaries or any  fiduciary of any Employee Benefit Plan, in any case with
respect to any Employee  Benefit Plan; and no Employee Benefit Plan or any
fiduciary thereof has been  the  subject of an audit, investigation or
examination by any Governmental  Entity.

of the  Code has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue  Service or is comprised of a master or prototype plan that has
received a  favorable opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service. Since
the date  of  each most recent determination letter referred to in this
paragraph (h), to  the  Knowledge of Target no event has occurred and no
condition or circumstance  has  existed that resulted or is reasonably
likely to result in the revocation of  any  such determination letter or
that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect  the qualified status of
any such Employee Benefit Plan.

 

 

(i) Except  as  would not individually or in the aggregate be reasonably
expected to result  in  any material and adverse impact on Target and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole,  neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the Knowledge of Target,  any  of their respective directors,
officers, employees or, other persons who  participate in the operation of
any Employee Benefit Plan or related trust  or  funding vehicle, has engaged

(j) Except  as  set forth on _Section 4.21(j)_  of the  Target Disclosure
Letter, the execution of this Agreement and the consummation  of the
transactions contemplated hereby, do not constitute a triggering event  under
any Employee Benefit Plan which (either alone or upon the occurrence  of 
any additional or subsequent event) will result in any material payment
(whether  of severance pay or otherwise), or acceleration, vesting or
material increase  in  benefits to any employee or former employee or
director of Target or any of  its  Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on
_Section 4.21(j)_  of the  Target Disclosure Letter, no Employee Benefit
Plan provides

conditions relating to the past or present business  or  operations of

the lawful  ownership of their properties and assets or the operation of
their businesses  as  presently conducted, except as the failure to obtain

The  Debt  Commitment Letter has been duly executed by Parent and is in full
force and  effect. All commitment fees required to be paid thereunder have
been paid in  full or will be duly paid in full when due. As of the date
hereof, the Debt  Commitment Letter has not been amended or terminated, and

Knowledge of Parent, there  is  no existing fact, occurrence or condition
that would cause the commitments  provided in the Debt Commitment Letter to
be terminated or ineffective, any  of  the conditions contained therein not
to be met or the financing contemplated  by  the Debt Commitment Letter not
to be consummated. Except for the conditions  described in the Debt
Commitment Letter, there are no other conditions precedent  to the Debt

determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX hereof  or
the rights to indemnification under Article XI hereof.

interferes with the ongoing business of Target or any of its Subsidiaries; 
(y) causes any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement to be

connection  with their compliance with this Section 6.5 and (B) indemnify and

Parent, Target shall cause each officer and member of its  board of directors
and the boards of directors (or comparable governing bodies)  of each of its
Subsidiaries to tender his resignation from such position  effective as of
the Effective Time.

 

 

§6.7 _Affiliate  Agreements_.  Target  shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, terminate at or prior to the  Effective Time, without
payment or penalty as set forth on _Section 6.7_  of the  Target Disclosure

hand, and any of their respective Affiliates (other than  Target or any other
Subsidiary of Target), on the other hand, including the  Sponsor Management

from the date of this Agreement to the earlier to occur of  the  Closing
Date and the date of termination of the Agreement in accordance with  its 
terms, Target and its Subsidiaries may consider written requests that may be 
suggested by the Parent (provided they are in reasonable detail) with
respect  to  any and all obligations relating to the employees of Target's
UK Subsidiaries  arising under applicable UK Law including the ERA, the
Transfer Regulations  and  TULRCA in respect of Target's UK Subsidiaries
arising out of the Merger or  Parent's intended conduct of business

Losses incurred or suffered by Target  Indemnitees arising out of such
implementation including any claim by or on  behalf of any employees, former
employees, trade union, works council, staff  association, worker
representative, persons or bodies (whether elected or not)  arising out of
any failure or alleged failure on the part of Target and/or  its 
Subsidiaries (including the UK Subsidiaries) to comply with their legal

or  any other failure or alleged failure to comply with the Transfer

ARTICLE  VII

 

 

_COVENANTS  OF PARENT_

 

 

§7.1 _Conduct  of Business of Parent_. (a) During the period from the date
of  this Agreement to the Closing Date, Parent shall refrain from:

 

 

(i) except  as  set forth in Section 7.4, amending or restating its charter
or by-laws (or  comparable organizational or governing documents);

 

 

(ii) declaring,  paying or setting aside any dividend or making any
distribution other than  dividends or distributions by any Subsidiary of
Parent to Parent or any other  wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, or
splitting, combining, redeeming,  reclassifying, purchasing or otherwise
acquiring directly, or indirectly (other  than pursuant to previously
announced share buyback program), any shares of  capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interest in, Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries except for
purchases of equity held by management of Target or  any  of its
Subsidiaries; or

 

 

(iii) incurring  any Indebtedness for borrowed money which would reasonably
be expected to cause  the conditions to the Debt Financing not to be
satisfied.

 

 

(b) During  the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date,
Parent shall,  and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use all commercially
reasonable efforts  to,  confer on a monthly basis with one or more
designated representatives of Target  regarding operational matters
(including employee and human resources related  matters) and the general
status of ongoing operations.

 

 

§7.2 _Debt  Financing_.  Parent  will use all commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) maintain the Debt  Commitment Letter in full force and effect,
and will not amend, terminate or  waive any provisions under such Debt
Commitment Letter, and (ii) comply, to  the extent within Parent's control,
with all of the covenants of Parent in the  Debt Commitment Letter and take
all actions, to the extent within Parent's  control, necessary or desirable
to cause all of the conditions to the funding  of  the financing
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter to be satisfied as  promptly as
practicable following the date hereof and in coordination with  the 
satisfaction of the other closing conditions set forth herein, including 
obtaining any opinions of legal counsel required by the Lenders thereunder 
and,  to the extent within Parent's control, assuring that there is no breach
or  default or event of default under any of its existing financing
agreements  and  (iii) accept any changes in the terms and conditions of the
proposed financing  contemplated in the "market flex" provision of the Debt
Commitment Letter or fee  letter related thereto. Parent agrees to notify the
Target following its receipt  of notification by any financing source under
the Debt Commitment Letter or  in  connection with any substitute debt or
other financing of such source's  indications that it does not intend to
provide, questions its requirement to  provide or asserts its inability or
refusal to provide the financing described  in the applicable Debt Commitment
Letter. If the funding of the indebtedness  contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter becomes unavailable or Parent  reasonably believes that
such funding may not occur for any reason other than  a  breach by Target or
Target Stockholders of any of its representations,  warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein or in any Ancillary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Agreement,  Parent will use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
alternative  financing on terms that are no less favorable to Parent (as
determined in the  reasonable judgment of Parent) than to those contained in
the Debt Commitment  Letter or fee letter related thereto including, for the
avoidance of doubt,  the "market flex". Parent shall keep the Target
reasonably informed of any material  adverse developments relating to the
proposed debt financing. Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall use all commercially  reasonable efforts to satisfy the closing
conditions to the debt financing  contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
(or, if applicable, the alternative  financing) that are within its control.

 

 

§7.3 _Indemnification  of Directors and Officers_.  The  Organizational
Documents of Parent shall contain provisions no less favorable  with respect
to the limitation or elimination of liability and indemnification  than are
set forth in the Organizational Documents of Target as of the date  of  this
Agreement (it being understood that the existing bylaws of Parent and  the 
Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation satisfy this 
requirement), which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise 
modified for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date in any manner 
that would materially adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals 
who  at or prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of Target
or any  of  its Subsidiaries. Contemporaneously with the Closing, Parent
shall purchase  tail  insurance (the premiums of which shall be paid by
Parent) covering each Person  currently covered by the Target's or its
Subsidiaries' directors' and officers' liability insurance policies, with
respect to matters or circumstances occurring  at or prior to the Closing
Date, on coverage terms that are equivalent in all  material respects to the
coverage terms of such current insurance policies  in  effect for the Target
and its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement. The  provisions of this
Section 7.3 are (i) intended to be for the benefit  of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Person entitled to indemnification under  this Section
7.3, and each such Person's heirs, legatees, representatives,  successors and
assigns, it being expressly agreed that such Persons shall be  third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 7.3 and (ii) in addition to,  and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification that any such  Person
may have by contract or otherwise.

 

 

§7.4 _Parent  Organizational Documents_.  Immediately prior to the Effective
Time and assuming the receipt of the Parent  Stockholders Approval, Parent
shall file with Secretary of State of the State  of  Delaware the
Certificate of Incorporation Amendment and the Certificate of  Designation to
be effective immediately prior to the Effective  Time.

 

 

§7.5 _Review  of Parent_. Target may, prior to the Closing Date, directly or
through its  representatives, review the properties, books and records of
Parent and each  of  its Subsidiaries and their financial and legal
condition to the extent it  reasonably believes necessary or advisable to
familiarize itself with such  properties and other matters. Such review shall
not, however, affect the  representations and warranties made by Parent in
this Agreement or the remedies  of Target for breaches of those
representations and warranties. Parent shall  and  shall cause its
Subsidiaries to permit Target and its representatives to have,  after the
date of execution of this Agreement, reasonable access during normal 
business hours, and on reasonable written advance notice, to the premises
and  to  all the properties, books and records of Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries  and  Parent shall cause the officers, employees, counsel,
accountants, consultants  and other representatives of Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries to furnish  Target with such financial and operating data and
other information with respect  to the business and properties of Parent and
its Subsidiaries as Target shall  from time to time reasonably request;
_provided_ , that

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  investigation and assistance shall not unreasonably disrupt the
operations  of  Parent and its Subsidiaries, or cause the loss of
attorney/client privilege,  Parent and its Subsidiaries shall have no
obligation to provide the foregoing  to  Target. Any information provided,
or caused to be provided, by Parent or its  Subsidiaries pursuant to this
Section 7.5 shall be subject to the terms of  the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

§7.6 _Parent  Stockholders Approval_.

 

 

(a) As  soon  as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent shall  prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement.
Parent shall respond promptly  to any comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC on the Proxy Statement.  Parent shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Proxy  Statement to be cleared by the SEC as promptly as
practicable after its filing  and thereafter cause the Proxy Statement to be
distributed to stockholders  of  Parent as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Proxy Statement has  been  cleared by the SEC. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy  Statement will be made
by Parent, without providing Target and its counsel  a  reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior  to  Parent
Stockholders Meeting any information relating to Parent or Target, or  any 
of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered 
by  Parent or Target that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to  the  Proxy Statement, so that it would not include any misstatement of a
material  fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not  misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify  the  other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing  such  information shall be promptly filed with the
SEC by Parent and, to the extent  required by Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of Parent. Parent shall notify  Target promptly of the receipt
of any comments from the SEC or the staff of  the  SEC and of any request by
the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or  supplements to the Proxy
Statement for additional information and shall supply  Target with copies of
all correspondence between Parent or any of its  Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the  other hand, with respect
to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. Target shall,  and  shall cause its
officers, directors and stockholders to, cooperate with Parent  in connection
with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, including promptly  furnishing
Parent upon request with any and all information as may be required  to be
set forth in the Proxy Statement under applicable Law.

 

 

(b) Parent  shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, establish  a  record date for and promptly take any and all
actions in connection therewith,  and duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold as soon as practicable (and,  in  any event, no more than forty (40)
days following the distribution of the  Proxy Statement to the stockholders
of Parent), a meeting of its stockholders  (the " _Parent  Stockholders
Meeting_ ")  solely  for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholders
Approval. Subject to its  fiduciary duties under applicable law, Parent shall
(i) through its board  of directors, recommend to its stockholders adoption
of this Agreement, the  Merger, the adoption of the Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of  Incorporation, and the approval of the other
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement  and  (ii) use all
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit and obtain Parent  Stockholders
Approval.

 

 

§7.7 _Waiver  of Standstill_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 6 of the  Confidentiality Agreement, Parent hereby
agrees that after the Proxy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Statement  has been mailed to the stockholders of Parent, WCAS shall be
permitted to  purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock in the
aggregate (but  in  any event, subject to applicable Law). At the Closing,
WCAS will execute the  Stockholders Agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit  C_   (the " _Stockholders  Agreement_ "). 
WCAS  represents that all such purchases shall be made in accordance with
applicable  law, shall not be permitted to be made in the event WCAS is in
possession of  material inside information, WCAS shall continue to and shall
comply with all  other provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (including
the confidentiality  provisions). Such purchases may be effectuated through
market trades or private  purchases. Two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing, Target shall deliver  a certificate to Parent containing a list of
each such purchase that includes  the name of the acquiring Person, the
number of shares acquired, the means  by  which such shares were acquired,
the date of each such purchase, and the  purchase prices paid by such
Persons. After the Closing, WCAS shall notify  Parent in writing within two
(2) Business Days after the purchase of any  securities under this Section
7.7, which notice shall contain the same  information described in the
immediately preceding sentence. For the avoidance  of doubt, any shares
acquired pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall not be  counted in determining
whether WCAS is entitled to nominate its directors  pursuant to the
Stockholders Agreement. **** In  no  event will the purchase of such shares
or any damages incurred by WCAS in  connection therewith be considered for
purposes of the indemnification  provisions of this Agreement; provided that
the foregoing is not intended to  limit in any manner WCAS's rights and
remedies as they exist under applicable  Law or otherwise unrelated to this
Agreement.

 

 

§7.8 _Financial  Reports_.  Promptly following their availability in the
ordinary course of Parent's  business, Parent shall provide Target with a
monthly consolidated balance sheet  of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the
preceding month and the related profit  and loss statement, and shall cause
Parent's Chief Executive Officer and the  Chief Financial Officer to be
available to discuss such financial statements  and  the financial and
operating performance of Parent as reasonably requested by  Target.

 

 

§7.9 _Compensation  and Benefits_ **.**

 

 

(a) Parent  shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation for a period from
and after  the  Closing Date until at least through the nine (9) month
anniversary of the  Closing, to continue to provide compensation and benefits
to individuals who  are  current employees of Target or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date  (" _Employees_ ")  that  are
substantially equivalent, in the aggregate, to either the compensation  and 
employee benefits provided to the Employees by Target or any of its
Subsidiaries  immediately prior to the Closing Date or the compensation and
employee benefits  provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries;  _provided_   that,  the foregoing shall not be construed to
limit the ability of the Surviving  Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to
terminate the employment of any  employee (including the Employees) at any
time or for any reason or no  reason.

 

 

(b) In  the  event that any Employee is at any time after the Closing Date
transferred to  Parent or any Affiliate of Parent or becomes a participant in
any benefit or  compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement of
Parent or any of its  Affiliates, Parent shall, to the extent permitted by
Law and by the applicable  plan, program, agreement or arrangement, cause
such plan, program, agreement  or  arrangement to treat, for purposes of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligibility  and vesting only, the prior service of such Employee with Target
or any of  its  Subsidiaries, to the extent such prior service is recognized
under the  comparable plan, program, agreement or arrangement of Target or
any of its  Subsidiaries, as service rendered to Parent or its Affiliates, as
the case  may  be; provided, that in administering such plans, programs,
agreements or  arrangements of Parent or any of its Affiliates, Parent may
cause a reduction  of  benefits under any such plans, programs, agreements
or arrangements to the  extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits
with respect to the same  covered matter or years of service; and provided,
further, that no credit shall  be required under this sentence to the extent
that such credit would require  any  increased benefits or other more
favorable provisions to be given or made  applicable to any other employees
in order for any plan to satisfy any  applicable law or satisfy any
requirements for any intended favorable tax  treatment.

 

 

(c) Each  of  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause its medical,
dental and other  welfare plans in which Employees or their dependants
commence to participate  after the Closing Date to (i) waive any preexisting
condition limitations to  the  extent waived or satisfied by such Employee
(or dependant) under similar plans  of Target or any of its Subsidiaries for
the plan year in which such  participation begins, and (ii) take into account
any deductible and  out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Employees and
dependants under similar  plans of Target or any of its Subsidiaries for the
plan year in which such  participation begins. To the extent permitted by Law
and by the applicable  plan,  Parent will cause to be waived any medical
certification for such Employees  up  to the amount of coverage such
Employees had under any life insurance plan  of  Target or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

 

(d) Parent  agrees that Parent and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible
for satisfying  the continuation coverage requirements under COBRA for all
MandA qualified  beneficiaries as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulation §54.4980B-9.

 

 

(e) Nothing  in this Agreement, express or implied, shall: (i) confer upon
any Employee  any  rights or remedies, including any right to employment or
continued employment  for any period or terms of employment, of any nature
whatsoever, or (ii) except  as otherwise required for Parent and the
Surviving Corporation to satisfy their  obligations under the other
provisions of this Section 7.9, be interpreted  to  prevent or restrict
Parent or its Affiliates from modifying or terminating  the  employment or
terms of employment of any Employee, including the amendment  or 
termination of any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or 
arrangement, after the Closing Date, or (iii) without limiting the
generality  of  Section 13.11, confer upon any Employee any rights as a
third-party beneficiary  of this Section 7.9.

 

 

(f) Unless  Parent requests otherwise in writing, the Board of Directors of
the Target  shall  adopt resolutions terminating, effective no later than
the day prior to the  Closing Date, any Employee Benefit Plan which is
intended to meet the  requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code, and which
is sponsored, or  contributed to, by the Target or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, a "401(k)  Plan"). At the Closing, the Target shall provide to Parent
executed resolutions  of the Board of Directors of the Target authorizing
such termination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall cause the
401(k) Plan to  permit continued repayment of participant loan balances under
the 401(k)  Plan following the plan termination date but prior to the date
distributions  from the 401(k) Plan are permitted, or Parent\'s 401(k) plan
to permit the  rollover to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Parent\'s  401(k) plan of all 401(k) Plan account balances that include loan
promissory  notes prior to the receipt of the IRS determination letter.

 

 

(g) Prior  to  the Closing, Target shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain a waiver  from any disqualified persons (within the meaning of
Section 280G(c) of the  Code) of the amount of any payments contingent upon
the execution of this  Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby that  have  been, or may be, made or paid to such person
(the "Payments") sufficient to  cause none of the Payments (or a portion
thereof) to be, or become, subject  to  the deduction disallowance rules
under Section 280G of the Code. Following  the receipt of such waivers,
Target shall submit the Payments for approval  by  Target's shareholders,
and provide shareholders with disclosure of such  Payments, each in
accordance with Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and Treas.  Reg.  1.280G-1
QandA 7. Prior to submitting the Payments for approval by  Target's
shareholders, Target shall disclose the documentation necessary to  effect
this Section 7.9(h), including the applicable shareholder consent, 
disclosure letter, and waivers, to Parent.

 

 

§7.10 _Exclusivity_.  Parent  will not knowingly solicit during the period
commencing on the date hereof  and  ending on the earlier of the date that
is four (4) months from the date hereof  and the Closing Date any proposals
to acquire Parent.

 

 

§7.11 _Escrowed  Shares_.  At all  times while Escrowed Shares are held by
the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow  Agreement, the Target Stockholders
shall have the right to (i) exercise any  voting rights with respect to the
Escrowed Shares, and (ii) receive all products  and proceeds of any of the
Escrowed Shares, including all dividends, whether  in  the form of cash,
stock or any other form, and any other rights and other  property which the
Target Stockholders are, from time to time, entitled to  receive in respect
of or in exchange for any or all of the Escrowed Shares.  In  addition, in
the event of the issuance of shares of capital stock or other  property as a
result of a stock split, merger, consolidation, combination of  shares or
similar recapitalization, a reorganization or a mandatory conversion  with
respect to or affecting the Escrowed Shares that becomes effective during 
the term of this Escrow Agreement, the additional shares of capital stock or 
other property so issued, paid, exchanged or substituted (if any) with
respect  to the Escrowed Shares shall be added to or substituted or exchanged
for the  Escrowed Shares as Escrowed Shares hereunder.

pursuant to the HSR Act, and  (ii) any other

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Governmental  Entity, any other filings, reports, information and
documentation required  or  deemed warranted for the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to any other  antitrust Laws or any other
applicable Laws. Each of Parent and Target will  furnish to each other's
counsel such necessary information and reasonable  assistance as the other
may require in connection with its preparation of any  filing or submission
that is necessary under the HSR Act, any other antitrust  Laws and any other
applicable Laws.

 

 

(b) Each  of  Parent and Target will use all commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain  promptly any clearance required under the HSR Act, any other
antitrust Laws  and  any other applicable Laws and will keep each other
apprised of the status of  any  material communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional  information from any Governmental
Entity and will comply promptly with any  reasonable inquiry or request from
any such Governmental Entity; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  nothing in
this Agreement will require or be deemed to require Parent in order  to
obtain any regulatory approvals or consents, (i) to agree to, or effect, 
any  material divestiture, or (ii) to take any other action(s), including
agreeing  to  any requirements, conditions or any limitations on its
business, if in the  aggregate all actions so taken by Parent would
collectively reasonably be  expected to have an impact on Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,  that is equivalent to or greater than the
impact that would reasonably be  expected to be experienced by them in the
event that Parent were to make a  material divestiture (a " _Material 
Negative Regulatory Impact_ "),  it  being understood that in assessing
whether there would be a Material Negative  Regulatory Impact the expected
impacts on Parent and its Subsidiaries from  any  agreed to divestiture
(whether material or not) will be taken into consideration  for purposes of
this clause (ii).

 

 

(c) Each  of  Parent and Target agrees to instruct their respective counsel
to cooperate  with  each other and use all commercially reasonable efforts
to facilitate and  expedite the identification and resolution of any issues
arising under the  HSR  Act and any other antitrust Laws at the earliest
practicable dates. Such  commercially reasonable efforts and cooperation will
include causing its counsel  (i) to inform promptly the other of any oral
communication with, and  provide (as permitted) copies of written
communications (excluding competitively  sensitive information) with, any
Governmental Entity regarding any such filings  or applications or any such
transaction, and (ii) to confer with each other  regarding appropriate
contacts with and response to personnel of such  Governmental Entity. None of
Parent, Target nor any of their respective  Affiliates will independently
contact any Governmental Entity or participate  in  any meeting or
discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such  filings,
applications, investigation or other inquiry without giving, in the  case of
Parent and its Affiliates, Target, and in the case of Target and its 
Affiliates, Parent, prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted 
by  the relevant Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and
participate  (which, at the request of Parent or Target, as applicable, will
be limited  to  outside antitrust counsel only).

 

 

§8.2 _All  Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.  Subject  to the terms and
conditions contained herein, Parent and Target shall, and  Target shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, cooperate and, subject to the  limitations
contained in Section 8.1, use all commercially reasonable efforts  to  take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to make, or cause to  be 
made, all filings necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and 
regulations and to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including all
commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Closing  Date, all Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and  Orders and parties to Material Contracts with Target or
any of its Subsidiaries  (including landlords in respect of the leases set
forth on Section 4.2(a) of  the  Parent Disclosure Letter) as are necessary
for consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and to fulfill  the  conditions to consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby set forth  in  Article IX of this
Agreement; provided, that no Indebtedness for borrowed  money shall be
repaid, except as otherwise required pursuant to the terms of  the 
applicable loan agreement and no Material Contract shall be amended to
increase  the amount payable thereunder or otherwise to be materially more
burdensome  to  Target or any of its Subsidiaries, to obtain any such
consent, approval or  authorization, without first obtaining the written
approval of  Parent.

 

 

§8.3 _Public  Announcements_.  Neither  Target nor Parent shall, nor shall
any of their respective Affiliates, without  the approval of the other party,
issue any press releases or otherwise make  any  public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, except as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations  pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange so  long  as such party has
used all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the  approval of the other
party prior to issuing such press release or making such  public disclosure.

 

 

§8.4 _Litigation  Support_.  In the  event and for so long as either party
is actively contesting or defending  against any Proceeding brought by a
third party in connection with any fact,  situation, circumstance, status,
condition, activity, practice, plan,  occurrence, event, incident, action,
failure to act or transaction involving  the  Target or any of its
Subsidiaries, the other party shall reasonably cooperate  with the contesting
or defending party and its counsel in the contest or  defense, make available
its personnel and provide such access to its  non-privileged books and
records as may be reasonably requested in connection  with the contest or
defense, at the sole cost and expense of the contesting  or  defending party
(unless such contesting or defending party is entitled to  indemnification
therefor under Article XI, in which case, the costs and  expense shall be
borne by the Indemnifying Party in accordance with  Article XI).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.4 shall not  apply to
Proceedings with respect to which the parties are in dispute as to  whether
one of the parties has an obligation to provide indemnification under 
Article XI.

_SURVIVAL_

 

 

§11.1 _Representations  and Warranties_.  The  representations and
warranties of Target and Parent contained in this Agreement  or in any
instrument, certificate or writing delivered pursuant to this  Agreement or
any other agreement contemplated hereby shall survive until the  date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date. The covenants shall  survive in
accordance with their terms. The representations, warranties and  covenants
contained in this Agreement or in any instrument, certificate or  other 
writing delivered in connection with this Agreement or any other agreement 
contemplated thereby shall in no event be affected by any investigation,
inquiry  or examination made for or on behalf of any party, or the Knowledge
of any  party's representatives or the acceptance by any party of any
certificate or  other writing delivered hereunder.

 

 

§11.2 _Indemnification_.  (a)  Target  Stockholders agree to indemnify and
hold Parent and its Affiliates (including  Target and its Subsidiaries) and
their respective affiliates, stockholders,  officers, directors, employees,
agents, successors and assigns (each, a " _Parent  Indemnitee_ "), 
harmless on an after tax basis (taking into account benefits arising from
the  Loss) from and against any damages, losses, Liabilities, actions, costs,
Taxes,  deficiencies, assessments, judgments, obligations, claims of any
kind, interest,  penalties, fines or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys', consultants and  experts' fees and expenses and all amounts paid
in investigation, defense or  settlement of any of the foregoing but
excluding punitive damages other than  punitive damages actually paid to a
third party), whether or not arising out  of  any claims by or on behalf of
any party to this Agreement or any third-party  claims (collectively, "
_Losses_ "),  suffered, incurred or paid, directly or indirectly, through
application of  Target's or Parent's assets or otherwise, as a result of, in
connection with or  arising out of (i) the failure of any representation or
warranty made by  Target or any Target Stockholder in this Agreement (whether
or not contained  in  Article IV) or in any Ancillary Agreement or in any
instrument, certificate  or  writing delivered pursuant to this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement to  be  true and correct in all respects as of the
date of this Agreement and as of  the  Closing Date (without giving effect
to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect  or similar qualifiers contained
therein, other than with respect to any  materiality, Material Adverse Effect
or similar qualifier contained in the  Qualified Representations and
Warranties); (ii) any breach by Target or any  Target Stockholder of any of
their respective covenants or agreements contained  herein or in any
Ancillary Agreement; and (iii) any claim by any third party  (including
Governmental Entities) against or affecting Target or any of its 
Subsidiaries which, if successful, would give rise to or relate to a breach 
of  (x) any of the representations or warranties on the part of Target or any
of  its  Subsidiaries referred to in clause (i) above, or (y) any of the
covenants  or agreements of Target or any of its Subsidiaries referred to
in  clause (ii) above. The amount of any indemnification due hereunder to 
Parent Indemnitee for any Losses shall be reduced to take into account any 
Tax  benefit actually realized by Parent Indemnitee arising from the
incurrence  or  payment of, or otherwise in respect of, such Losses. If any
Parent Indemnitee  actually receives any Tax benefit subsequent to an
indemnification payment  by a  Target Stockholder hereunder, then such
Parent Indemnitee shall promptly  reimburse the Target Stockholder for any
payment made or expense incurred by  such Target Stockholder in connection
with providing such indemnification up  to  the amount received by the
Parent Indemnitee.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Parent  agrees to indemnify and hold Target Stockholders and their
Affiliates and their  respective stockholders, officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors  and  assigns (other than Target and its
Subsidiaries) (each, a " _Target  Indemnitee_ ")  harmless from and against
Losses suffered, incurred or paid, directly or  indirectly, as a result of,
in connection with or arising out of (i) the  failure of any representation
or warranty made by Parent in this Agreement  (whether or not contained in
Article V) or in any instrument or other writing  delivered pursuant to this
Agreement to be true and correct in all respects  as  of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date (without giving effect  to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifiers contained 
therein) and (ii) any breach by Parent of any of the covenants or  agreements
contained herein or in any Ancillary Agreement. For the avoidance  of  doubt
and not withstanding the representations and warranties of Parent  contained
in this Agreement (including Section 5.6), indemnifiable Losses of  the 
Target Indemnitees shall not include any losses of any type of Target or any 
Target Stockholder relating to the purchase of Parent securities other than 
the  Parent Preferred Shares received as Merger Consideration.

 

 

(c) The  obligations to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to this Section
11.2  shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement for the time periods set forth in Section 11.1, except for
claims  for indemnification asserted prior to the end of such periods, which
claims  shall survive until final resolution thereof.

 

 

(d) The  obligations to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to Section
11.2(a) and  Section 11.2(b) shall be limited to an aggregate amount of
$30,000,000 and  no Person shall be entitled to recovery for Losses pursuant
to such sections  unless each individual indemnifiable Loss under such
Sections exceeds $50,000  (the " _Mini-basket_ "),  it  being understood
that for purposes of determining whether an individual loss  exceeds the
Mini-basket, all Losses based on claims or a series of related  claims
arising out of similar facts or circumstances, shall be aggregated, 
including all indemnification claims under Section 11.2(a)(i) or 11.2(b)(i) 
as a result of, in connection with, or arising out of damage to units or
missing  units that is not disclosed in any section of the Target Disclosure
Letter  or  Parent Disclosure Letter, respectively, or otherwise based on
any other failure  of the representations and warranties in Section 4.10 or
Section 5.9,  respectively (but, in connection with any breach of Section
4.10(b) or 5.9(b),  respectively, excluding up to 500 damaged or missing
units with a value not  to  exceed $1,500,000), and until the total amount
of Losses exceeds $3,000,000  (the " _Basket  Amount_ ");  _provided_ , 
that to  the extent the amount of Losses exceeds the Basket Amount, the
Indemnified  Party  shall be entitled to recover the entire amount of Losses
in excess of  $1,500,000.

 

 

(e) All  claims for indemnification by Parent Indemnitees pursuant to 
Section 11.2(a) shall first be satisfied from the Escrow Amount and once  the
Escrow Amount has been paid to satisfy Parent Indemnitees' indemnification 
claims or released to Target Stockholders pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, 
the  Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to pursue all claims for
indemnification  under Section 11.2(a) directly against Target Stockholders
in accordance with  the Joinder Agreement or letter of transmittal, as the
case may be. Except  as  otherwise provided in the Joinder Agreement between
the WCAS Stockholders and  Parent, the indemnification obligations of Target
Stockholders pursuant to  this  Article XI are several and not joint, it
being understood that the receipt  of  each Target Stockholder's Pro Rata
Portion of the Merger Consideration is  conditioned on such Target
Stockholder's execution and delivery to Parent of the  letter of transmittal
or counterpart to Joinder Agreement, as  applicable.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

69  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) All  amounts paid to Parent pursuant to Section 11.2(a) above shall, to
the extent  permitted by applicable Law, be treated as adjustments to the
Purchase Price  for  all Tax purposes.

 

 

§11.3 _Indemnification  Procedure_.  (a)  Within a  reasonable period of
time after the incurrence of any Losses by any Person  entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2 hereof (an " _Indemnified  Party_
"),  including, any claim by a third party described in Section 11.4, which 
might give rise to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall 
deliver to the party from which indemnification is sought (the "
_Indemnifying  Party_ ")  and to  the Escrow Agent, if applicable, a
certificate (the " _Claim  Certificate_ "),  which  shall:

 

 

(i) state  that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly accrued Losses or
anticipates  that it may incur liability for Losses for which such
Indemnified Party believes  it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement; and

 

 

(ii) specify  in reasonable detail (to the extent practicable) each
individual item of Loss  included in the amount so stated, the date such item
was paid or properly  accrued, the basis for any anticipated liability and
the nature of the  misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of covenant
or claim to which  each  such item is related and the computation of the
amount to which such Indemnified  Party claims to be entitled hereunder.

 

 

(b) In  the  event that the Indemnifying Party shall object to the
indemnification of an  Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims
specified in any Claim  Certificate, the Indemnifying Party shall, within ten
(10) days after  receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Claim Certificate,
deliver to the  Indemnified Party a notice to such effect and the
Indemnifying Party and the  Indemnified Party shall, within the thirty (30)
day period beginning on the  date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such
objection, attempt in good  faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each  of  such claims to which the Indemnifying
Party shall have so objected. If the  Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party shall succeed in reaching agreement  on their respective rights with
respect to any of such claims, the Indemnified  Party and the Indemnifying
Party shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum  setting forth such
agreement. Should the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying  Party be unable
to agree as to any particular item or items or amount or  amounts, then the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall submit  such  dispute to
a court of competent jurisdiction. The party which receives a final  judgment
in such dispute shall be indemnified and held harmless for all  reasonable
attorney and consultant's fees or expenses by the other  party.

 

 

(c) Claims  for Losses specified in any Claim Certificate to which an
Indemnifying Party  shall not object in writing within ten (10) days of
receipt of such Claim  Certificate, claims for Losses covered by a memorandum
of agreement of the  nature described in Section 11.3(b), claims for Losses
the validity and  amount of which have been the subject of judicial
determination as described  in  Section 11.3(b) and claims for Losses the
validity and amount of which  shall have been the subject of a final judicial
determination, or shall have  been settled with the consent of the
Indemnifying Party, as described in  Section 11.4, are hereinafter referred
to, collectively, as " _Agreed  Claims_ ".  Within  ten (10) days of the
determination of the amount of any Agreed Claims,  subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 11.2(d), (i) if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

70  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indemnified  Party is a Parent Indemnitee, then the Target Stockholder
Representative and  Parent shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a
joint written instruction  instructing the Escrow Agent to release to Parent
(A) if the Escrowed Cash  exceeds the amount of the Agreed Claim, an amount
in cash equal to such Agreed  Claim, or (B) if the Agreed Claim exceeds the
Escrowed Cash but is lower than  the Escrow Amount, the Escrowed Cash plus a
number of shares of Parent Preferred  Stock equal to the amount of the excess
of the Agreed Claim over the Escrowed  Cash, divided by the Fair Market
Value, or (C) if the Agreed Claim exceeds  the  Escrow Amount, then the
Target Stockholders shall, at the Target Stockholders' option, (x) the number
of shares of Parent Preferred Stock that divided by  the  Fair Market Value
equals the excess of the Agreed Claim over the Escrow Amount,  or (y) pay to
the Parent Indemnitee in accordance with the Joinder Agreement  the  amount
of the excess of the Agreed Claim over the Escrow Amount by wire transfer  in
immediately available funds to the bank account or accounts designated by 
the  Parent Indemnitee in a notice to the Target Stockholders not less than 
two (2) Business Days prior to such payment or (ii) if the Indemnified  Party
is a Target Indemnitee, then Parent shall pay to the Target Indemnitee  an 
amount equal to the Agreed Claim by wire transfer in immediately available 
funds  to the bank account or accounts designated by the Target Indemnitee in
a notice  to Parent not less than two (2) Business Days prior to such 
payment.

 

 

§11.4 _Third  Party Claims_.  If a  claim by a third party is made against
any Indemnified Party, and if such party  intends to seek indemnity with
respect thereto under this Article XI, such  Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party of such claims;  _provided_ ,  that  the
failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its 
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is 
actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall
have  thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to assume the conduct
and  control, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party
at  the  expense of the Indemnifying Party, of the settlement or defense
thereof and  the  Indemnified Party shall cooperate with it in connection
therewith; _provided_ ,  that  (i) the Indemnifying Party shall permit the
Indemnified Party to  participate in such settlement or defense through
counsel chosen by such  Indemnified Party, provided that the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall  be  borne by such Indemnified Party and (ii)
the Indemnifying Party shall  promptly be entitled to assume the defense of
such action only to the extent  the  Indemnifying Party acknowledges its
indemnity obligation and assumes and holds  such Indemnified Party harmless
from and against the full amount of any Loss  resulting therefrom; _provided_
,  _further_ ,  that  the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume control of such defense  and shall pay the fees and expenses of
counsel retained by the Indemnified  Party  if (1) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection  with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation;  (2) the claim
seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the  Indemnified Party; (3)
the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by  counsel that a
reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between  the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party; (4) the Indemnified Party 
reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to the action, 
lawsuit, investigation, proceeding or other claim giving rise to such claim 
for  indemnification would be detrimental to or injure the Indemnified
Party's  reputation or future business prospects; (5) the amount claimed by
the  Indemnified Party (if such Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnitee)
exceeds  the  value of the shares of Parent Preferred Stock then held by the
Escrow Agent  or  (6) upon petition by the Indemnified Party, the
appropriate court rules  that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to
vigorously prosecute or  defend such claim. Any Indemnified Party shall have
the right to employ separate  counsel in any such action or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

71  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  and  to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses
of such counsel  shall not be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party unless
(x) the  Indemnifying Party shall have failed, within a reasonable time after
having  been  notified by the Indemnified Party of the existence of such
claim as provided  in  the preceding sentence, to assume the defense of such
claim, (y) the  employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized
in writing by the  Indemnifying Party, which authorization shall not be
unreasonably withheld,  or  (z) the named parties to any such action
(including any impleaded parties)  include both such Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party and such  Indemnified Party shall have been advised in
writing by such counsel that there  may be one or more legal defenses
available to the Indemnified Party which  are  not available to the
Indemnifying Party, or available to the Indemnifying Party  the assertion of
which would be adverse to the interests of the Indemnified  Party. So long as
the Indemnifying Party is reasonably contesting any such  claim  in good
faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to 
pay  or settle any such claim, provided that in such event it shall waive any
right  to indemnity therefor by the Indemnifying Party for such claim unless
the  Indemnifying Party shall have consented to such payment or settlement.
If the  Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30)  days after the receipt of the Indemnified Party's notice of a
claim of indemnity  hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense
thereof, the Indemnified  Party  shall have the right to contest, settle or
compromise the claim but shall not  thereby waive any right to indemnity
therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The  Indemnifying Party shall not,
except with the consent of the Indemnified Party,  enter into any settlement
that is not entirely indemnifiable by the Indemnifying  Party pursuant to
this Article XI and does not include as an unconditional  term  thereof the
giving by the Person or Persons asserting such claim to all  Indemnified
Parties of an unconditional release from all liability with respect  to such
claim or consent to entry of any judgment.

 

 

§11.5 _Calculation  of Indemnity Payments_.  Any  Person seeking
indemnification under this Article XI (the " _Indemnitee_ ")  agrees  to use
all commercially reasonable efforts to pursue and collect on any material 
recovery available under any insurance policies; _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that  the Indemnitee shall not be obligated to make such insurance claim if
the cost  of pursuing such insurance claim together with any corresponding
increase in  insurance premiums or other chargebacks would exceed the value
of the claim  for  which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification. The
amount of Losses payable  under this Article XI by any Person from which any
Indemnitee is seeking  indemnification pursuant to this Article XI (the "
_Indemnitor_ ")  shall  be reduced by any and all amounts actually received
by the Indemnitee under  applicable insurance policies or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible  therefor. If the Indemnitee actually
receives any amounts under applicable  insurance policies or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible for any  Losses, subsequent to an
indemnification payment by the Indemnitor, then such  Indemnitee shall
promptly reimburse the Indemnitor for any payment made or  expense incurred
by such Indemnitor in connection with providing such  indemnification up to
the amount received by the Indemnitee, net of any expenses  incurred by such
Indemnitee in collecting such amount.

ARTICLE  XII

 

 

_TERMINATION  AND ABANDONMENT_

 

 

§12.1 _Termination_.  This  Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be  abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective
Time:

 

 

(a) by  mutual  written consent of Target, on the one hand, and of Parent,
on the other  hand;

 

 

(b) by  any  Party if the Effective Time shall not have occurred by August
15, 2008;  _provided_ ,  that  the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 12.1(b) shall not  be available to any Party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under this  Agreement shall be the cause of the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before  such date;

 

 

(c) by  either  Target, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, if
there has been a  breach of any covenant or a breach of any representation or
warranty of Parent  or Target, respectively, which breach would cause the
failure of any condition  precedent set forth in Sections 9.2 or 9.3, as the
case may be,  _provided_ ,  that  any such breach of a covenant or
representation or warranty has not been cured  within ten (10) Business Days
following receipt by the breaching party of  written notice of such breach;

 

 

(d) by  any  Party, if there shall be any Law of any competent authority
that makes  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, illegal or
otherwise  prohibited or if any Order of any competent authority prohibiting
such  transactions is entered and such Order shall become final and non-
appealable;  or

 

 

(e) by  any  party, if the Parent Stockholders Approval is not obtained.

 

 

§12.2 _Effect  of Termination_.  (a)  If this  Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 12.1 by Parent, on the one  hand, or Target, on the other
hand, written notice thereof shall be given to  the  other party specifying
the provision of Section 12.1 pursuant to which such  termination is made,
and this Agreement shall be terminated and there shall  be  no liability
hereunder on the part of Parent or Target, except that the  provisions of
Section 8.3 (Public Announcements), Section 12.1  (Termination), this Section
12.2(a),  Section 13.1 (Expenses; Transfer Taxes), Section 13.2 (Governing
Law)  and Section 13.3 (Jurisdiction; Agents for Service of Process) shall 
survive any termination of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 12.2(a) 
shall relieve any party of liability for any willful breach of this 
Agreement.

 

 

(b) In  the  event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 12.1(e)
and at the  time of such termination Target and Target Stockholders are in
compliance with  all of their representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained  herein and in the Ancillary Agreements and, other than
the failure of any  condition to Target's closing under this Agreement caused
by Parent's breach of  its obligations hereunder, all of the conditions to
Target's closing hereunder  have been satisfied or would be capable of
satisfaction at or prior to the  Effective Time assuming the Effective Time
were to occur at any time up to  and  including the date specified in
Section 12.1(b) but the Parent Stockholders  Approval is not obtained and,
there exists at any time prior to the special  stockholders meeting a bona-
fide acquisition proposal to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

73  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquire  all or substantially all of the common stock or assets of Parent,
then within  three (3) Business days of the date of such termination Parent
shall  reimburse Target for all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses  of Target incurred in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this  Agreement and the evaluation of the transactions
contemplated hereby;  _provided_   that in  no event shall such
reimbursement exceed $3,000,000.00.

 

 

ARTICLE  XIII

 

 

_MISCELLANEOUS_

 

 

§13.1 _Expenses;  Transfer Taxes_.  Except  as set forth in Section 6.5 and
Section 12.2(b), whether or not the  Merger is consummated, the parties
hereto shall pay all of their own expenses  relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the  fees  and expenses of their
respective counsel and financial advisers.  All  Transfer Taxes shall be
paid by Parent.

 

 

§13.2 _Governing  Law_.  The  interpretation and construction of this
Agreement, and all matters relating  hereto, shall be governed by the laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard  to the principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

 

 

§13.3 _Jurisdiction;  Agents for Service of Process_.  Any  judicial
proceeding brought against any of the parties to this Agreement on  any 
dispute arising out of this Agreement or any matter related hereto may be 
brought in the courts of the State of New York, or in the United States
District  Court for the Southern District of New York, and, by execution and
delivery  of  this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement accepts
the exclusive  jurisdiction of such courts, and irrevocably agrees to be
bound by any judgment  rendered thereby in connection with this Agreement.
The foregoing consents  to  jurisdiction and appointments of agents to
receive service of process shall  not  constitute general consents to
service of process in the State of New York  for  any purpose except as
provided above and shall not be deemed to confer rights  on  any Person
other than the respective parties to this Agreement. The prevailing  party or
parties in any such litigation shall be entitled to receive from the  losing
party or parties all costs and expenses, including reasonable counsel  fees,
incurred by the prevailing party or parties. Each of Target, Parent,  the 
Target Stockholders and the Target Stockholder Representative agree that
service  of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail
to such  party's address set forth above shall be effective service of
process for any  action, suit or proceeding in New York with respect to any
matters for which  it  has submitted to jurisdiction pursuant to this
Section 13.3.

§13.6 _Assignment;  Parties in Interest_.  This  Agreement may not be
transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated by any  party  hereto without
the express written consent of the other party hereto, other  than  by
operation of law; _provided_ ,  that  Parent may assign its rights,
interests and obligations hereunder (i) to  any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary or to any Affiliate of which  Parent is a direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary, (ii) in connection  with the transfer by Parent of
all or substantially all of the capital stock  and/or assets of Target and/or
its Subsidiaries and (iii) for the purpose  of securing any financing of the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,  that if 
Parent makes any assignment referred to in (i) or (iii) above, Parent shall 
remain liable under this Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon and 
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, 
executors, administrators, successors and permitted assigns.

 

 

§13.7 _Counterparts_.  This  Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which taken  together shall constitute one instrument.

 

 

§13.8 _Entire  Agreement_.  This  Agreement, including the Parent
Disclosure Letter, the Target Disclosure Letter,  Exhibits and any other
documents referred to herein which form a part hereof,  contains the entire
understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the  subject matter
contained herein and therein. This Agreement supersedes all  prior 
agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such
subject  matter. If an Exhibit is a form of agreement, such agreement, when 
executed and delivered by the parties thereto, shall constitute a document 
independent of this Agreement.

 

 

§13.9 _Amendments_.  This  Agreement may not be changed, and any of the
terms, covenants, representations,  warranties and conditions cannot be
waived, except pursuant to an instrument  in  writing signed by Parent and
Target or, in the case of a waiver, by the party  waiving compliance.

 

 

§13.10 _Severability_.  If any  term, provision, agreement, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held  by  a court of competent jurisdiction
or other authority to be invalid, void or  unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, agreements, covenants  and  restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall  in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal  substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner 
materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a determination, the
parties  shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
affect the  original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
reasonably acceptable  manner in order that the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

76  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transactions  contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest  extent possible.

 

 

§13.11 _Third  Party Beneficiaries_.  Except  as contemplated by Articles X
and XI, each party hereto intends that this  Agreement shall not, and this
Agreement shall not, benefit or create any right  or cause of action in or on
behalf of any Person other than the parties  hereto.

 

 

§13.12 _No  Strict Construction_.  The  parties hereto have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of  this  Agreement. In the event
any ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation  arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by all parties  hereto, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or  disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this  Agreement.

 

 

§13.13 _Waiver  of Jury Trial_.  Each of  Parent and Target hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable  Law, any right it may have to
a trial by jury in respect of any litigation  as  between the parties
directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in  connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or  disputes relating
hereto. Each of Parent and Target (i) certifies that no  representative,
agent or attorney of the other party has represented, expressly  or otherwise
that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek  to enforce
the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other  party have
been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things,  the 
mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 13.13.

 

 

§13.14 _Specific  Performance_.  Each  party agree that irreparable damages
would occur to the other parties if any  of  the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their  specific terms or were
otherwise breached by such party. It is accordingly  agreed that a party
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent  actual breaches
of this Agreement by the other parties and to enforce  specifically the terms
and provisions hereof in the courts referenced in Section  13.3 (or, on a
preliminary basis in order to preserve the status quo pending  a  decision
of the courts referenced in Section 13.3, or in order to enforce a  judgment
of the courts referenced in Section 13.3, in any court of competent 
jurisdiction), in addition to having any other remedies to which a party is 
entitled at law or in equity and without the necessity of proving damages or 
posting a bond or other security
