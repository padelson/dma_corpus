 \t\t

 \t\t\tCONVERSION OF SECURITIES \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.1. Effect on Securities. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Merger Sub Membership Interests. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof
or any other Person, the limited liability company interests of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
Company Common Units equal to the number of Company Common Units converted
into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b). Holdings as the
holder of such Company Common Units at the Effective Time continues as a
Member. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Company Securities. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Company Common Units. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof (but subject
to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1(b)(vi)), each
Company Common Unit (other than Excluded Common Units and Company Common Units
issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a)) that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive
1.1427 (the "Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
Parent Shares (as adjusted by Section  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t3  \t\t  \t\t\t2.1(b)(vi), the "Merger Consideration") to be transferred by Holdings
pursuant to the Merger and this Agreement. In addition and notwithstanding
the cancellation of the Company Common Units (including pursuant to Section
2.2), following the Effective Time, holders as of the relevant record date of
Company Common Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will have continued rights to any distribution from the Company, without
interest, with respect to such Company Common Units with a record date
occurring prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by
the Company Board with respect to such units in accordance with the terms of
the Company LLC Agreement and this Agreement and which remains unpaid as of
the Effective Time. Such distributions by the Company are not part of the
Merger Consideration, and will be paid on the payment date set therefor to
such holders of Company Common Units whether or not such holders exchange such
Common Units pursuant to Section 2.2. Prior to the Effective Time, Holdings
shall exercise the Option Right and Parent shall issue to Holdings, pursuant
to the exercise by Holdings of the Option Right, that number of Parent Shares
that are to be delivered by Holdings to the holders of Company Common Units
pursuant to the Merger and this Agreement. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, all
Company Common Units (other than Excluded Common Units and Company Common
Units issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a)) shall cease to be outstanding and
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
and uncertificated book entry that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any Company Common Units (other than Excluded Common Units) (as
applicable, a "Company Certificate" or "Book Entry Unit") shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be transferred
by Holdings pursuant to the Merger with respect to the Company Common Units
formerly represented thereby and any dividends or other distributions to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) Treatment of Excluded Common Units and Other Membership
Interests. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, (A) the Company
Common Units that are held by Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub or by any
Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Excluded
Common Units"), (B) the Subordinated Units, (C) the Transocean Member Interest
and (D) the Incentive Distribution Rights shall remain outstanding as
Membership Interests in the Surviving Entity, unaffected by the Merger.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) Unvested Phantom Units. The parties acknowledge that, as of
the date hereof, awards of phantom units ("Phantom Unit Awards") representing
176,621 Company Common Units subject to performance and/or time-based vesting
conditions have been granted and have not yet vested under a Company Benefit
Plan.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(A) Except as provided in Section 2.1(b)(iv)(B), immediately prior
to the Effective Time, all time-based Phantom Unit Awards granted prior to the
date of this Agreement and all performance-based Phantom Unit Awards granted
prior to January 1, 2016, in each case, that are unvested shall become fully
vested without any action on the part of the awardholder, the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub and, as a result, a number of Company Common Units determined in
accordance with the  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t4  \t\t  \t\t\tterms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan and award agreement (such
number as may be reduced to comply with applicable withholding requirements)
will be issued to the awardholder immediately prior to the Effective Time and
each such unit will be treated at the Effective Time, the same as, and have
the same rights and be subject to the same conditions as, each Company Common
Unit described in Section 2.1(b)(i). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(B) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all performance-based
Phantom Unit Awards granted on or after January 1, 2016 shall be deemed to
have vested in a number of Earned Phantom Units (as such term is defined in
the Terms and Conditions of such grant) determined by multiplying 100% by
45,802 (the number of target performance-based phantom units), and, as a
result, a corresponding number of Company Common Units (such number as may be
reduced to comply with applicable withholding requirements) will be issued to
the awardholder immediately prior to the Effective Time and each such unit
will be treated at the Effective Time, the same as, and have the same rights
and be subject to the same conditions as, each Company Common Unit described
in Section 2.1(b)(i). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) Vested Phantom Units. The parties acknowledge that, as of
the date hereof, Phantom Unit Awards representing 24,900 Company Common Units
that were subject to time-based vesting conditions have been granted and have
vested but have not converted to Company Common Units under a Company Benefit
Plan.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(A) Except as provided in Section 2.1(b)(iv)(B), immediately prior
to the Effective Time, all time-based Phantom Unit Awards that have vested but
have not converted to Company Common Units shall convert to Company Common
Units without any action on the part of the awardholder, the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub and, as a result, a number of Company Common Units determined in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan and award
agreement (such number as may be reduced to comply with applicable withholding
requirements) will be issued to the awardholder immediately prior to the
Effective Time and each such unit will be treated at the Effective Time, the
same as, and have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions as,
each Company Common Unit described in Section 2.1(b)(i). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(B) The Company shall take all necessary action to provide that
each Phantom Unit Award listed in Section 2.1(b)(iv)(B) of the Company
Disclosure Letter that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire Company Common Units, and
Parent shall assume each such Phantom Unit Award (hereinafter an "Assumed
Phantom Unit Award") which shall, effective as of the Effective Time,
represent the right to acquire Parent Shares, subject to the terms of the
applicable Company Benefit Plan and award agreement; provided, however, that
the number of Parent Shares issuable  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t5  \t\t  \t\t\tupon settlement of such Assumed Phantom Unit Award shall be equal to
the number of Company Common Units that were subject to the Phantom Unit Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded down to the nearest whole Parent Share). Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company, the Company Board (or the compensation committee of the
Company Board), Parent and the Parent Board (or the compensation committee of
the Parent Board) shall take all actions necessary under the Company Benefit
Plans and Parent Benefit Plans and the award agreements thereunder and
otherwise to effectuate this Section 2.1(b)(iv)(B). Following the Effective
Time, no holder of a Phantom Unit Award that becomes an Assumed Phantom Unit
Award shall have any right to receive any Company Common Units in respect of
such Phantom Unit Award or any right to receive the Merger
Consideration. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(v) Further Action. The Company, the Company Board (or the
compensation committee of the Company Board), Parent and the Parent Board (or
the compensation committee of the Parent Board) shall take all requisite
action to implement and effectuate the foregoing provisions of Section
2.1(b)(iii) and Section 2.1(b)(iv). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vi) Certain Adjustments. If between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, whether or not permitted pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the outstanding Parent Shares in respect thereof shall be changed
by reason of any subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
split-up, combination or exchanging of shares, merger, consolidation,
reorganization or other similar transaction, or any dividend or distribution
of Parent Shares or other dividend or distribution payable in other securities
shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any similar event
shall have occurred, the Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and any
similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted
to provide the holders of Company Common Units and Phantom Unit Awards with
the same economic effect as was contemplated by this Agreement prior to giving
effect to such event. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.2. Exchange of Certificates. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a commercial bank or trust company or such other party as is
reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent hereunder for
the purpose of exchanging Company Certificates and Book Entry Units for the
Merger Consideration and the payment of any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.2(c) (the "Exchange Agent"). As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, (i) Holdings or Parent shall provide the
Exchange Agent an uncertificated Parent Share book-entry representing the
number of Parent Shares that are issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (as such
number may be adjusted by Section 2.2(e)) to be held by the Exchange Agent in
trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Units (other than
holders of Excluded Common Units and Company Common Units issued pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)), and (ii) authorize the Exchange Agent to exchange Parent
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t6  \t\t  \t\t\tShares in accordance with Section 2.1(b). Parent shall deposit, or
transfer to Holdings and Holdings shall deposit, with the Exchange Agent any
cash or other consideration as and when necessary to pay any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Parent shall pay all costs
and fees of the Exchange Agent and all expenses associated with the exchange
process. Such Parent Shares, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto as provided in Section 2.2(c), are referred to herein as
the "Exchange Fund." The Exchange Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions
consistent with the terms of this Agreement, shall deliver the Parent Shares
to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and the payment of any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) out of the Exchange Fund, and
the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose whatsoever. The
Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to the Parent Shares held by it from time to time
hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions paid or distributed after the deposit of such Exchange Fund with
respect thereto for the account of Persons entitled thereto. \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Exchange Procedures. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and
in any event not later than the second Business Day following the Closing
Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, and Parent shall and
shall cause the Exchange Agent to make otherwise available, to each holder of
record of one or more Company Common Units as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a form of letter of transmittal to be used to effect the
exchange of such Company Common Units for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.2(c), along with instructions for using such letter of transmittal to effect
such exchange. The letter of transmittal (or the instructions thereto) shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Company Common Units shall pass, only upon delivery thereof together with (A)
delivery of the corresponding Company Certificate to the Exchange Agent or (B)
receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agent's message" with respect to Book
Entry Units. Such letter of transmittal shall be in customary form and have
such other provisions as Parent and Company may reasonably agree prior to the
Effective Time. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Company Certificate
for cancellation, together with a duly completed and executed letter of
transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, or receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agent's message" with
respect to Book Entry Units, (A) the holder of Company Common Units shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor an uncertificated Parent Share book-
entry representing the number of whole Parent Shares that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.2(e) (along with any
unpaid dividends and distributions with respect to such Parent Shares as
provided in Section 2.2(c)); and (B) the Company Certificate or Book Entry
Units represented by the "agent's message" so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration
or unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Company
Common Units. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t7  \t\t  \t\t\t(iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Units that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Company Common Units (along
with any unpaid dividends and distributions with respect to such Parent Shares
as provided in Section 2.2(c)) may be paid to a transferee if the Company
Certificate representing such Company Common Units is presented to the
Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer, including such signature guarantees as Parent or the Exchange
Agent may reasonably request, and to evidence that any applicable unit
transfer taxes have been paid. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Dividends and Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Units.
The former holders of Company Common Units to whom Parent Shares must be
delivered pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to receive dividends or
other distributions with respect to the Parent Shares as of the Effective
Time; provided, however, that if under Applicable Law the Parent Shares to be
delivered to the former holders of any Company Common Units are not eligible
to receive a dividend or other distribution paid by the Parent on or after the
Effective Time, Holdings shall instead and in lieu of such dividend or other
distribution pay the former holders of Company Common Units a U.S. dollar
amount equal to the value of such dividend or other distribution, and provided
further, that no dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the former
holder of any Company Common Units until such holder shall surrender such
units in accordance with this Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of
Applicable Law: (i) at the time of the surrender of any such Company Common
Units for exchange in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2,
there shall be paid to the surrendering holder, without interest, the amount
of dividends or other distributions (having a record date after the Effective
Time but on or prior to surrender and a payment date on or prior to surrender)
not theretofore paid with respect to the number of whole Parent Shares that
such holder is entitled to receive; and (ii) at the appropriate payment date
and without duplicating any payment made under clause (i) above, there shall
be paid to the surrendering holder, without interest, the amount of dividends
or other distributions (having a record date after the Effective Time but on
or prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender) payable with
respect to the number of whole Parent Shares that such holder receives. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Units. The
Merger Consideration delivered and paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Company Common Units in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash
paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c)) shall be deemed to have been delivered and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common
Units. At the Effective Time, the limited liability company interest transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and from and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Company Common
Units that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, a Company Certificate or Book Entry Unit is
presented to the Surviving Entity for any reason, it shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Section 2.2. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional Parent Shares shall be issued in the Merger. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t8  \t\t  \t\t\tAgreement, all fractional Parent Shares that a holder of Company
Common Units converted pursuant to the Merger would otherwise be entitled to
receive as Merger Consideration (after taking into account all Company
Certificates (or effective affidavits in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units
held by such holder) will be aggregated and then, if a fractional Parent Share
results from that aggregation, be rounded up to the nearest whole Parent Share
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, no Person that is not a record holder of
Company Common Units will be entitled hereunder to have any fractional Parent
Shares so rounded up, and none of Parent, Holdings or the Surviving Entity
shall have any obligation pursuant to this sentence with respect to any Person
that is not a record holder of Company Common Units) and any such additional
Parent Shares shall become part of the Merger Consideration. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains unclaimed by the former unitholders of the Company as of the
date that is 12 months following the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand. Thereafter, any former unitholders of the Company who
have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this Section 2.2 shall
look only to Parent and the Surviving Entity for payment of their claim for
Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent
Shares represented thereby (all without interest). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) No Liability. None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of Company Common Units for any amount properly delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. If any Company Common Units have not been surrendered in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 2.2 immediately prior to the date on which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental
entity), such amount shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such
holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously
entitled thereto. \t\t

 \t\t

good standing under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. To the
extent such concept or similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, to
the knowledge of the Company, the Company is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character
of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of
its business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so qualified or in good standing does not and is not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company (a "Company Material Adverse Effect"). The Company has all requisite
limited liability company power and authority to own, operate and lease its
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted, except where the
failure to have such power and authority does not and is not reasonably likely

performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the

company action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than the approval
referred to in Section 3.17. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub,
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to

authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and, to the knowledge of the Company,

each jurisdiction in which the ownership, operation or lease of its property

in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of the
Company's Significant Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable (except to the extent provided by Applicable Law) and,

financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the date of
this Agreement, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board and in Section 3.21 of the Company Disclosure Letter (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of the
Company who have a significant role in the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.  \t\t

adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans). Accordingly,
without limiting the generality of any other provision of this Agreement, the
Company acknowledges and agrees that Parent makes no representation or
warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts or plans). \t\t

Switzerland. Holdings is an exempted company duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Merger Sub is a
limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. To the

each of Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character
of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of
its business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so qualified or in good standing does not and is not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent (a
"Parent Material Adverse Effect"). Each of Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub
has all requisite company power and authority to own, operate and lease its
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted, except where the
failure to have such power and authority does not and is not reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
The copies of the Articles of Association and the Organizational Regulations

Association of Holdings and the Certificate of Formation and Limited Liability
Company Agreement of Merger Sub previously made available to the Company are

the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company, constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Parent,
Holdings and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub,

receive from the Company and/or the Company's Subsidiaries certain
projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts and certain
business plan information. Parent acknowledges and agrees that there are

officer, director (other than a director of the Company who is also an officer
or director of Parent) or financial advisor of the Company takes any action
(other than any action caused by or at the direction of Parent, Holdings,
their Affiliates or their Representatives) that if taken by the Company would
be a breach of this Section 5.2, the taking of such action by such officer,
director or financial advisor shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this
Section 5.2 by the Company. \t\t

the Company by such Person (for so long as such Company Alternative Proposal
has not been withdrawn in writing) if (i) none of the Company, the
Representatives of the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries or the
Representatives of the Company's Subsidiaries shall have breached the
provisions set forth in this Section 5.2 in any material respect with respect
to such Person, and (ii) the Company Board or the Conflicts Committee shall
have determined, in its good faith judgment, after consultation with the

duties under the Company LLC Agreement or Applicable Law of the Marshall
Islands; provided that the Company may not enter into negotiations or
discussions or supply any information in connection with a Company Alternative
Proposal without entering into a confidentiality agreement on terms
substantially similar in all matters as the Confidentiality Agreement (it
being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a
standstill provision and that the Company may amend or waive the standstill
provision in any confidentiality agreement entered into on or prior to the
date hereof to the extent necessary (and only to such extent) to enable such
counterparty to communicate confidentially a Company Alternative Proposal to
the Company Board or the Conflicts Committee), which confidentiality agreement

  \t\t\t40  \t\t  \t\t\tthird party to make Company Alternative Proposals to the Company in
connection with the negotiations and discussions permitted by this Section
5.2(b). Parent shall be entitled to receive notification promptly (and in any
event within 48 hours) after the Company's entering into such discussions or
negotiations or furnishing information to the Person making such Company
Alternative Proposal or its Representatives. The Company shall promptly
provide or make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the
Company and any Subsidiary of the Company that is provided to the Person
making such Company Alternative Proposal or its Representatives which was not
previously provided or made available to Parent. The Company agrees that it

received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions
or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, its
Subsidiaries, any of its Representatives, or any Representatives of the
Company's Subsidiaries, and thereafter shall keep Parent informed in writing,
on a reasonably prompt basis, of all material developments regarding the
status of any such inquiry, contact or proposal and the status of any such
negotiations or discussions. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent
the Company Board or the Conflicts Committee from (i) taking and disclosing to
unitholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to unitholders in connection with
the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), or issuing a
"stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that
any disclosure by the Company that relates to a Company Alternative Proposal
shall be deemed to be a Company Change in Recommendation unless the Company
Board or the Conflicts Committee, as applicable, reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation in such disclosure; or (ii) contacting and engaging in
discussions otherwise in accordance with this Section 5.2 with any Person or
group and their respective Representatives who has made a Company Alternative
Proposal that has not been withdrawn in writing and that was not solicited in
breach of this Section 5.2 solely for the purpose of, and to the extent
necessary for, clarifying the terms of such Company Alternative
Proposal. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Conflicts Committee) thereof shall (i) (A)

transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (B) recommend, adopt or approve,
or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Company Alternative
Proposal, (C) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy

"Company Change in Recommendation") or (ii) (A) recommend, adopt or approve,
or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, or allow the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company
Alternative Proposal or that would require the Company to abandon, terminate
or fail to consummate the Merger (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 5.2(b)) (a "Company  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t41  \t\t  \t\t\tAcquisition Agreement") or (B) resolve, agree or publicly propose to
do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, prior to obtaining the Company Unitholder Approval, the Company
Board (upon the recommendation of the Conflicts Committee), in the case of
clause (1) of this sentence, or the Conflicts Committee or the Company Board,
in the case of clause (2) of this sentence, shall have determined, in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with the Company's outside counsel and
financial advisors) that the failure to do so would reasonably likely be
inconsistent with its duties under the Company LLC Agreement or Applicable Law
of the Marshall Islands, it may (1) terminate this Agreement pursuant to and
in accordance with Section 7.3(b) and cause the Company to enter into a
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal or
(2) make a Company Change in Recommendation in connection with a Company
Superior Proposal, but in the case of clause (1) and (2) of this sentence,
only if (w) such Company Superior Proposal has not resulted from a breach of
its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.2; (x) the Company provides written
notice to Parent (a "Company Notice of Change in Recommendation") advising
Parent that the Conflicts Committee or the Company Board, as applicable,
intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the
terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal, the identity of the
Person making the Company Superior Proposal and copies of all relevant
documents relating to such Company Superior Proposal that the Company has
received from the Person or its representatives that made such proposal and
that are the basis of the proposed action by the Conflicts Committee or the
Company Board, as applicable, including a copy of the proposed Company
Acquisition Agreement (if any) (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Company
Superior Proposal shall require a new Company Notice of Change in
Recommendation and compliance with the requirements of this Section 5.2(c));
(y) during a period of four Business Days following Parent's receipt of a
Company Notice of Change in Recommendation (or, in the event of a new Company
Notice of Change in Recommendation as a result of any such amendment, an
extension of two additional Business Days), if requested by Parent, the
Company and its Representatives shall have negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith to make such revisions or adjustments proposed
by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger
and not to make such Company Change in Recommendation; and (z) if applicable,
at the end of such applicable four- or two-Business Day period, the Company
Board or the Conflicts Committee, as applicable, after considering in good
faith any such revisions or adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement that Parent, prior to the expiration of such applicable period,
shall have offered in writing in a manner that would form a binding contract
if accepted by the Company, continues to determine, in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with the Company's outside counsel and financial advisors)
that the Company Alternative Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal
and that failure to make such Company Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its duties under the Company LLC Agreement or Applicable Law
of the Marshall Islands. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Other than in connection with a Company Alternative Proposal,
the Company may, by action of the Company Board or the Conflicts Committee, at
any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Unitholder Approval,
make a Company Change in Recommendation in response to a Company Intervening
Event (a "Company Intervening Event  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t42  \t\t  \t\t\tChange in Recommendation") if the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the duties of the members of the Conflicts Committee or the
Company Board, as applicable, under the Company LLC Agreement or Applicable
Law of the Marshall Islands, provided, that: (i) Parent shall have received
written notice from the Company (a "Company Notice of Intervening Event Change
in Recommendation") of the Company's intention to make a Company Intervening
Event Change in Recommendation at least four Business Days prior to the taking
of such action by the Company, which notice shall specify the applicable
Company Intervening Event in reasonable detail (provided, that any material
change to the facts and circumstances that are the basis for such Company
Intervening Event Change in Recommendation shall require a new Company Notice
of Intervening Event Change in Recommendation and an extension of two
additional Business Days), (ii) during such period and prior to making a
Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation, if requested by Parent,
the Company and its Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions or adjustments proposed
by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger
and not make such Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation and (iii)
the Company may make a Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation only
if the Company Board or the Conflicts Committee, after considering in good
faith any revisions or adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement that Parent shall have, prior to the expiration of the four-Business
Day period, offered in writing in a manner that would form a binding contract
if accepted by the Company, continues to determine in good faith that failure
to make a Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its duties under the Company LLC Agreement or Applicable Law
of the Marshall Islands.  \t\t

similar transaction or series of transactions involving the Company (or any
Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 25% or
more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (B) for the issuance by the Company of 25% or
more of its equity securities of any class or (C) to acquire in any manner,
directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the equity securities of any class or
consolidated total assets of the Company or 25% or more of the aggregate
equity securities of any class of the Company's Subsidiaries, in each case

circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or condition or
combination thereof that (A) was not known to the Company Board or the
Conflicts Committee as of the date of this Agreement (or if known, the

and (B) does not relate to any Company Alternative Proposal; provided,
however, that (1) any change in the price or trading volume of the Common
Units or Parent Shares shall not be taken into account for purposes of
determining whether a Company Intervening Event has occurred (it being
acknowledged, however, \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t43  \t\t  \t\t\tthat any underlying cause thereof may be taken into account for
purposes of determining whether a Company Intervening Event has occurred); and
(2) the Company or Parent meeting, failing to meet or exceeding projections
shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether a Company
Intervening Event has occurred (it being acknowledged, however, that any
underlying cause thereof may be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether a Company Intervening Event has occurred). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) "Company Superior Proposal" shall mean any Company
Alternative Proposal (A) which provides that 75% of the Company's outstanding

constitute 75% or more of the outstanding equity securities of the acquiring
or surviving entity or its ultimate parent or (B) providing for the sale of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, in each case on terms which the Company Board or the
Conflicts Committee determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation
with the Company's outside counsel and financial advisors, are more favorable
to the holders of Membership Interests (in their capacity as such) than the
Merger (or any bona fide written offer or proposal made by Parent in response
to such Company Alternative Proposal or otherwise), taking into account all
the terms and conditions of such Company Alternative Proposal and this
Agreement (including the likelihood of satisfaction of any member approval
requirements, the expected timing of consummation thereof, and all other
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such Company Alternative Proposal
and this Agreement). \t\t

Entity shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent
permitted under Applicable Law each Person who is, or has been at any time

Subsidiary thereof) and each Person who served at the request of the Company
as a director, officer, trustee, or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise (individually, an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs
or expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions,
or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their capacities as such, whether
commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (an
"Action"), (i) Parent and the Surviving Entity shall pay, as incurred, the
fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, which counsel
shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Surviving Entity, in advance
of the final disposition of any such Action to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law and, if required, upon receipt of any undertaking required by
Applicable Law to repay the amounts so advanced to the extent it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification, and
(ii) Parent and the Surviving Entity will cooperate in the defense of any such
matter; provided, however, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without their written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and provided further,
that Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not be obligated pursuant to this
Section 5.11 to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for
all Indemnified Parties in any single Action, unless, in the good faith
judgment of any of the Indemnified Parties, there is or may be a conflict of
interests between two or more of such Indemnified Parties, in which case there
may be separate counsel for each similarly situated group. \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t48  \t\t  \t\t\t(c) Parent shall prior to the Closing, purchase a six-year
officers' and directors' liability insurance prepaid "tail" policy on terms no
less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company with respect to
matters arising on or before the Closing, covering without limitation the
transactions contemplated hereby. The provisions of this Section shall
survive the Closing and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable
by, each Indemnified Party \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Entity's (or, if a
successor or assign has assumed the Surviving Entity's obligations set forth
in this Section 5.11(d) pursuant to Section 5.11(e), any successor thereto's)

Company shall pay Parent a fee of $15 million (the "Termination Fee") in cash
by wire transfer to the account designated by Parent in Section 7.5 of the
Parent Disclosure Letter. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 7.2(b) [failure to obtain Company Unitholder Approval]
(other than in any circumstances where a fee is payable under Section 7.5(a)),
then the Company shall reimburse Parent for its costs and expenses (including
all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, consultants, financial
advisors, financing sources and investment bankers of such party and its
Affiliates) in connection with the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution, financing and performance of this Agreement and all other matters
related to the Merger, up to a maximum of $2.5 million. In circumstances
where this Section 7.5(b) requires a reimbursement of costs and expenses, the
Company shall reimburse Parent for such costs and expenses in cash by wire
transfer to the account designated by Parent in Section 7.5 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter on the later of (i) the day that is three Business Days
after the date of termination of this Agreement and (ii) the day that is three
Business Days after the delivery of documentation of such costs and expenses.
In the event the payment of a Termination Fee by the Company is required

its costs and expenses pursuant to this Section 7.5(b), the amount of such
costs and expenses so reimbursed will be offset against the Termination Fee
payable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t55  \t\t  \t\t\t(c) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the
abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article 7, all obligations of the
parties hereto shall terminate, except the obligations of the parties pursuant
to this Section 7.5, the last sentence of Section 5.5, and Section 5.10 and
except for the provisions of Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section 8.4, Section
8.6, Section 8.8, Section 8.9, Section 8.10, Section 8.11, Section 8.12,
Section 8.13 and Section 8.14, provided that nothing herein, including the
payment of any Termination Fee and/or expenses, shall relieve any party from
any liability for fraud or any willful and material breach by such party of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement or any action for fraud and all rights and remedies of such
aggrieved party under this Agreement in the case of such a willful and
material breach or fraud, at law or in equity, shall be preserved. For
purposes of this Section 7.5(c) and Section 8.3, "willful and material breach"
shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an act or a failure to
take such act by the breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of
such act (or the failure to take such act) would cause a material breach of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
the parties agree that in the event that the Company pays the Termination Fee
to Parent, the Company shall have no further liability to Parent, Holdings or
Merger Sub of any kind in respect of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all information
and material delivered by any party hereunder. The parties acknowledge that
payment of the Termination Fee, if, as and when required pursuant to this
Section 7.5, shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in
a reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount in
the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the
Termination Fee and/or expenses when due, as contemplated by this Section 7.5,
such Termination Fee and/or expenses, as the case may be, shall accrue
interest for the period commencing on the date such fee and/or expenses, as
the case may be, became past due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest
publicly announced by Citibank, in the City of New York, from time to time
during such period, as such bank's prime lending rate. Parent and the Company
acknowledge that the Termination Fee, expense reimbursement and the other
provisions of this Section 7.5 are an integral part of the Merger and that,
without these agreements, Parent and the Company would not enter into this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.6. Extension; Waiver. Subject to Section 8.5, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, each party may by action taken by its Board of
Directors, or any director or officer, properly delegated by the Board of
Directors, to the extent allowed under Applicable Law, (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the
benefit of such party contained herein. Any  \t\t

parties hereto, and any provision of this Agreement, except Section 6.1(a) may
be waived by the party or parties benefited by such provision, by duly

consideration, and permitted the Conflicts Committee not less than two
Business Days to make a recommendation to the Company Board with respect

breach, or any anticipated or threatened breach, of this Agreement by any of
the foregoing shall be made by the Conflicts Committee and shall not require
the approval of the Company's Members or the Company Board. This Agreement
may not be amended, and no provision of this Agreement may be waived, except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto, in
