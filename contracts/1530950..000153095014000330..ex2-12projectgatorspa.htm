NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
hereinafter set forth, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE OF PURCHASED SHARES

Section 1.1 Sale and Transfer of Purchased Shares. On the terms and subject to
the conditions contained in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Seller shall

(iii) minus the amount of Closing Date Indebtedness (as reflected on the Pay-
Off Letters); 

(iv) minus the Transaction Expenses;

(v) minus the Pre-Closing Tax Obligations; and

(vi) minus the Capital Expenditures Deficit.

Section 1.3 Payment Direction Certificate. Not more than ten (10) or less than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to the
Buyer a certificate, signed by its Chief Financial Officer (the "Payment
Direction Certificate"), setting forth in reasonable detail as of the Closing
Date the Company's good faith estimates of the following:

(a) the amount of the estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital (as
contemplated by Section 1.6) and the resulting estimate of the Working Capital
Adjustment (which amount may be a positive or negative number) (the "Estimated
WCA");

(b) the amount of the estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents (the "Estimated Cash
and Cash Equivalents");

(c) the amount of the estimated Transaction Expenses, itemized by the Person
to whom such amount is owed (the "Estimated Transaction Expenses");

(d) the amount of the estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, itemized by the
holders thereof (the "Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness");

(e) the amount of the estimated Pre-Closing Tax Obligations (the "Estimated
Pre-Closing Tax Obligations");

(f) the amount of the estimated Capital Expenditures Deficit (the "Estimated
Capital Expenditures Deficit") and

(g) the amount of the Closing Date Cash Payment.

The Payment Direction Certificate shall also specify the wire transfer
instructions with respect to the various disbursements of the Purchase Price
as contemplated in Section 1.5. Within two days of receipt of the Payment
Direction Certificate, the Buyer shall be entitled to review and comment on
and request reasonable changes to the various components of the Payment
Direction Certificate, and the Company shall cooperate with the Buyer in
connection therewith and consider (but shall not be obligated to make) the
Buyer's proposed changes in good faith.

Section 1.4 Payment of Purchase Price.

(a) At the Closing, or if the Closing does not occur on a Business Day, on the
first Business Day immediately following the Closing, the Buyer shall pay the
Purchase Price as follows: 

(i) An amount equal to $1,500,000 (the "Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount")
shall be deposited into the Closing Adjustment Escrow Account as provided in
Section 1.9 and Section 1.10;

(ii) An Amount equal to $10,000,000 (the "Indemnification Escrow Amount")
shall be deposited into the Indemnification Escrow Account as provided in
Section 1.9 and Section 1.10.

(iii) An amount equal to the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the holders of the Estimated
Closing Date Indebtedness, in such amounts and to such accounts as specified
in Payoff Letters;

(iv) An amount equal to the Estimated Transaction Expenses to the Persons, in
the amounts, and in accordance with the payment instructions set forth in the
Payment Direction Certificate; and

(v) An amount (the "Closing Date Cash Payment") equal to (A) the sum of (1)
$128,000,000, plus (2) the Estimated WCA (which amount may be a positive or
negative number), plus (3) the Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents, less (B)
the sum of (1) the Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount, plus (2) the
Indemnification Escrow Amount, plus (3) the Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness, plus (4) the Estimated Transaction Expenses, plus (5) the

Expenditures Deficit, by (x) releasing to the Seller the Earnest Money Deposit
(less the Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnification Escrow
Amount) as provided in Section 1.9 and Section 1.10, and (y) paying the
remaining balance by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by the Seller.

Section 1.5 Payoff of Certain Liabilities. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that the Purchase Price assumes that, at the Closing, the Company's only
indebtedness shall be current liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course,
including trade payables and accruals. The amount of all Funded Indebtedness
that remains unpaid and owing as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (collectively, the "Closing Date
Indebtedness") shall be extinguished and paid in full from the Purchase Price
as provided in Section 1.4(a)(iii). Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to the Buyer letters, setting forth the payoff amounts and the
payees of all Closing Date Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses, from the
holders of such amounts (which letters shall include the agreement of the
holder that upon payment in full of the applicable indebtedness secured by any
Encumbrance, such holder shall release and terminate all such Encumbrances)
("Pay-Off Letters").

Section 1.6 Purchase Price Calculation. The calculation of the Purchase Price
shall be based upon the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital,
the Cash and Cash Equivalents, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Transaction
Expenses, the Pre-Closing Tax Obligations and the Capital Expenditures
Deficit, each of which shall be based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
calculated and applied in the following manner. 

(a) Closing Date Balance Sheet. Within seventy-five (75) days following the
Closing Date, the Buyer will prepare and deliver to the Seller a balance sheet
for the Company as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet") and, based thereon and on
other information necessary to make the calculation, a calculation of the
amount of (i) both the Closing Date Net Working Capital and any resulting
Working Capital Adjustment (which will be calculated in the manner described
herein), (ii) the Cash and Cash Equivalents and any resulting Cash and Cash
Equivalents adjustment (which will be calculated in the manner described
herein), (iii) the Closing Date Indebtedness and any resulting Indebtedness
adjustment (which will be calculated in the manner described herein), (iv) the
Transaction Expenses and any resulting Transaction Expenses adjustment (which
will be calculated in the manner described herein), (v) the Pre-Closing Tax
Obligations and any resulting Pre-Closing Tax Obligations adjustment (which
will be calculated in the manner described herein), (vi) the Capital
Expenditures Deficit and any resulting Capital Expenditures Deficit
adjustment, and (vii) any resulting Closing Date Cash Payment Adjustment. The
Closing Date Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance with GAAP,
consistently applied, and prepared applying the same accounting principles and
methodologies used to prepare the Balance Sheet and applying the past
practices of the Company (and where GAAP provides for a range of alternatives
such past practices shall govern provided they are in accordance with GAAP).
Whether or not the date as of which the Closing Date Balance Sheet is required
to be prepared coincides with a fiscal quarter-end or fiscal year-end of the
Company, the Parties shall use customary closing procedures for the
preparation thereof, including procedures with respect to accounts and
adjustments. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Schedule 1.6(a) sets forth
an illustration of the calculation of the Purchase Price assuming (including
the various components and line items of Net Working Capital) that the Closing
Date had occurred on July 1, 2014.

(b) Physical Inventory. For purposes of calculating the value of the Inventory
reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, within two days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall take a physical count of the Inventory of the
Company, and the Buyer and its representatives shall be permitted to observe
such physical count. The count shall be adjusted for activity between the date
of the physical inventory and the Closing Date. For purposes of counting and
calculating the value of the Inventory of the Company for purposes of
determining the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that (in furtherance of the rules of GAAP and historical accounting
practices) (i) any finished inventory with a remaining shelf life of 6 months
or less without a valid purchase order shall be excluded, (ii) any packaging
inventory that is either greater than one year old or that is related to
products that the Company no longer manufactures shall be excluded; and (iii)
any supplies or ingredients inventory that exceeds the amounts that the
Company will reasonably use or ship (based upon historical practice) before
such inventory ages past the limits set forth in clause (i)-(ii) above shall
be excluded.

(c) Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Target Net Working Capital" shall be $15,938,000. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Closing Date Net Working Capital" shall be defined as the Net
Working Capital of the Company as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, "Net
Working Capital" shall be defined as the Company's current assets (excluding
the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents and current and deferred income Tax
assets) less the Company's current Liabilities (excluding the amount of
Transaction Expenses, Funded Indebtedness and current and deferred income Tax
Liabilities), calculated in accordance with GAAP, as consistently applied, and
as set forth on Schedule 1.6(a). For purposes of this Agreement, "Working
Capital Adjustment" shall be an amount equal to the Closing Date Net Working
Capital less the amount of the Target Net Working Capital (which amount may be
a positive or negative number). 

Section 1.7 Post Closing Adjustment of Closing Date Payment.

(a) Calculation of Closing Date Cash Payment Adjustment. Upon finalization of
the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Closing Date Cash Payment shall be
increased or decreased, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, to the extent that the
various estimates set forth on the Payment Direction Certificate are, on a
cumulative basis, greater or less, as applicable, than the corresponding final
amounts based upon the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the calculation of the
Pre-Closing Tax Obligations, as applicable (the "Closing Date Cash Payment
Adjustment"), as follows:

(i) Working Capital Adjustment. The Closing Date Cash Payment shall be
increased or decreased, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, to the extent that the
Working Capital Adjustment is greater than or less than, respectively, the
Estimated WCA.

(ii) Cash and Cash Equivalents Adjustment. The Closing Date Cash Payment shall
be increased or decreased, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, to the extent that
the Cash and Cash Equivalents are greater than or less than, respectively, the
Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents.

(iii) Transaction Expenses Adjustment. The Closing Date Cash Payment shall be
increased or decreased, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, to the extent that the
Transaction Expenses are less than or greater than, respectively, the
Estimated Transaction Expenses.

(iv) Indebtedness Adjustment. The Closing Date Cash Payment shall be increased
or decreased, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, to the extent that the Closing
Date Indebtedness is less than or greater than, respectively, the Estimated
Closing Date Indebtedness.

(v) Pre-Closing Tax Adjustment. The Closing Date Cash Payment shall be
increased or decreased, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, to the extent the Pre-
Closing Tax Obligations are less than or greater than, respectively, the
Estimated Pre-Closing Tax Obligations; provided, however, that the Pre-Closing
Tax Obligations shall not be deemed final until the expiration of the statute
of limitations period applicable to the matters covered thereby and, for
avoidance of doubt, any amount of the Pre-Closing Tax Obligations that shall
not have been deducted for purposes of determining the Purchase Price pursuant
to this Article I shall be subject to indemnification to the extent provided
in Article VIII. The fact that the Pre-Closing Tax Obligations are not
considered final shall not defer the date on which payments with respect to
such Pre-Closing Tax Obligations are due under this Section 1.7, Section 1.8
or Article VIII.

(vi) Capital Expenditures Deficit Adjustment. The Closing Date Cash Payment
shall be increased or decreased, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, to the extent
that the Capital Expenditures Deficit is less than or greater than,
respectively, the Estimated Capital Expenditures Deficit. 

(b) Payment of Closing Date Cash Payment Adjustment. In the event that, in the
aggregate, the Closing Date Cash Payment Adjustment results in an increase in
the Closing Date Cash Payment, (i) all of the Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount
shall be released to the Seller in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, and
(ii) the Buyer shall pay the Closing Date Cash Payment Adjustment to the
Seller. In the event that the Closing Date Cash Payment Adjustment results in
a decrease in the Purchase Price, (x) the Closing Date Cash Payment
Adjustment, up to the Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount, shall be released to
the Buyer in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, and (y) if the Closing Date
Cash Payment Adjustment exceeds the Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount, the
Seller shall pay to the Buyer the remaining balance of such Closing Date Cash
Payment Adjustment. If the Closing Date Cash Payment Adjustment is less than
the Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount, the balance of the Closing Adjustment
Escrow Amount not so applied as provided in the preceding sentence shall be
released to the Seller in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. Payments due
pursuant hereto by the Seller or the Buyer shall be paid in cash not later
than five (5) days following the date on which the Closing Date Balance Sheet
is completed and the calculations hereunder become final and binding on the
Parties; provided, however, that if the final determination of the Closing
Date Net Working Capital, the Cash and Cash Equivalents, the Transaction
Expenses, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Capital Expenditures Deficit and
the resulting Closing Date Cash Payment Adjustment have been made, but the
final determination of the Pre-Closing Tax Obligations has not been made
because the Company's Tax Return for its short taxable year ending on the
Closing Date (determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b) or any comparable provision of state or local requirements of
Law) has not been filed by the Seller, then the actions set forth in this
Section 1.7(b) shall be taken with respect to the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, the Cash and Cash Equivalents, the Transaction Expenses, the Closing
Date Indebtedness, the Capital Expenditures Deficit, and the resulting Closing
Date Cash Payment Adjustment and any further estimate of the Pre-Closing Tax
Obligations determined as of such date, and the actions set forth in this
Section 1.7(b) with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Obligations shall be taken not
more than two (2) Business Days after the filing of such Tax Return; provided,
further, however, that the Pre-Closing Tax Obligations shall not be deemed
final until the expiration of the statute of limitations period applicable to
the matters covered thereby and, for avoidance of doubt, any amount of the
Pre-Closing Tax Obligations that shall not have been deducted for purposes of
determining the Purchase Price pursuant to this Article I shall be subject to
indemnification to the extent provided in Article VIII.

Section 1.8 Disputes Regarding Closing Date Balance Sheet, Calculation of the
Closing Date Cash Payment Adjustment.

(a) If the Seller disagrees with the amounts of any of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital, the Cash and Cash Equivalents, the Transaction Expenses, the
Closing Date Indebtedness or the Capital Expenditures Deficit, or the amount
of the Closing Date Cash Payment Adjustment, as calculated using the Closing
Date Balance Sheet (including, without limitation, any claim that any of the
foregoing were calculated in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement), the Seller shall notify the Buyer of such disagreement in writing
specifying in detail the particulars of such disagreement within sixty (60)
days after the Seller's receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
amounts of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Cash and Cash
Equivalents, the Transaction Expenses, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Pre-
Closing Tax Obligations, the Capital Expenditures Deficit and the resulting
Closing Date Cash Payment Adjustment prepared by the Buyer; provided, however,
that in the event the Pre-Closing Tax Obligations are determined at the time
specified in Section 1.8(b), with respect to any disagreement relating to the
determination of Pre-Closing Tax Obligations only, the time periods specified
above in this Section 1.8(a) shall be measured from the date of such
determination. The Seller and the Buyer shall use reasonable efforts for a
period of thirty (30) days after the Buyer's receipt of such notice (or such
longer period as the Seller and the Buyer may mutually agree upon) to resolve
any disagreements raised by the Seller with respect to the amounts of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Cash and Cash Equivalents, the
Transaction Expenses, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Pre-Closing Tax
Obligations, the Capital Expenditures Deficit and any resulting Closing Date
Cash Payment Adjustment. During any such period of dispute, the Seller shall
have reasonable access to the working papers of the Company, the Buyer, and
their respective accountants relating to the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
the amounts of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Cash and Cash
Equivalents, the Transaction Expenses, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Pre-
Closing Tax Obligations, the Capital Expenditures Deficit and the amount of
any adjustment pursuant to Section 1.7(a)(i)-(vi) prepared by the Buyer and
calculated using the Closing Date Balance Sheet. 

(b) If, at the end of such period described in Section 1.8(a), the Seller and
the Buyer do not resolve such disagreements, the Seller and the Buyer shall
promptly select a mutually acceptable independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing to review the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the
amounts of and methodology of calculating the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, the Cash and Cash Equivalents, the Transaction Expenses, the Closing
Date Indebtedness, the Capital Expenditures Deficit and any resulting Closing
Date Cash Payment Adjustment prepared by the Buyer in accordance with the
procedures described herein and calculated using the Closing Date Balance
Sheet, and resolve any remaining disagreements regarding the foregoing items;
provided, however, that the accounting firm shall not review the Pre-Closing
Tax Obligations. If the Seller and the Buyer cannot agree upon an accounting
firm, they shall choose an accounting firm by lot from those "Big 4"
accounting firms having no material relationship to any of the Seller, the
Buyer or the Company. The determination by such independent accounting firm
applying the procedures described herein shall be final, binding, and
conclusive on the Parties and judgment may be entered thereon in a court of
competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that the Pre-Closing Tax
Obligations shall not be deemed final until the expiration of the statute of
limitations period applicable to the matters covered thereby and, for
avoidance of doubt, any amount of the Pre-Closing Tax Obligations that shall
not have been deducted for purposes of determining the Purchase Price pursuant
to this Article I shall be subject to indemnification to the extent provided
in Article VIII. The Seller and the Buyer shall make their respective
submissions to the independent accounting firm within thirty (30) days after
selecting such firm pursuant to this Section 1.8(b). The Seller and the Buyer
shall use reasonable efforts to cause such independent accounting firm to make
its determination within thirty (30) days after accepting its selection. The
fees and expenses of such independent accounting firm shall be shared by the
Seller and the Buyer as follows: of the aggregate amount in dispute, if the
independent accounting firm adopts the Seller's position absolutely, the Buyer
shall pay all such fees and expenses, and if the independent accounting firm
adopts the Buyer's position absolutely, the Seller shall pay all such fees and
expenses. If the independent accounting firm adopts a compromise between the
two positions, then the Seller and the Buyer shall share the fees and expenses
in inverse proportion to the relative success of each Party, with the more
successful Party bearing a proportionately smaller share of the fees and
expenses. 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise jointly agreed to by the
Buyer and the Seller, (i) the accounting firm shall not review the Pre-Closing
Tax Obligations; and (ii) the Buyer and the Seller shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any dispute as to the Pre-Closing Tax Obligations in
accordance with Section 6.6(a) (relating to the preparation and review of Tax
Returns). In the event that after good faith negotiations the parties cannot
agree, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the amounts or items that
are not disputed, and any remaining adjustments attributable to any disputed
item shall be made based on, and determined at the time, the Tax Returns that
include the Pre-Closing Tax Obligations relating to the disputed items are
filed.

Section 1.9 Escrow Agreement. On the date hereof, the Buyer, the Seller and
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Escrow Agent") have entered into
an Escrow Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Escrow
Agreement") providing for the deposit of the Earnest Money Deposit pursuant to
Section 1.10 and the establishment of (a) an escrow account (the
"Indemnification Escrow Account") with the Escrow Agent to secure any payments
to be made by the Seller pursuant to Article VIII hereof, and (b) an escrow
account (the "Closing Adjustment Escrow Account") with the Escrow Agent to
secure any payments to be made by the Seller pursuant to Section 1.7(b). At
the Closing, (x) a portion of the Earnest Money Deposit equal to the
Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be deposited into the Indemnification
Escrow Account, (y) a portion of the Earnest Money Deposit equal to the
Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be deposited in the Closing Adjustment
Escrow Account, and (z) the remainder of the Earnest Money Deposit shall be
released to the Seller. The Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be distributed
from the Indemnification Escrow Account to the Buyer or the Seller, as the
case may be, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

Section 1.10 Earnest Money Deposit. Not later than the end of the first
Business Day after the date hereof, the Buyer shall deposit $14,000,000 cash
with the Escrow Agent (the "Earnest Money Deposit") pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. If the Transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, (a) a
portion of the Earnest Money Deposit equal to the Indemnification Escrow
Amount shall be deposited into the Indemnification Escrow Account pursuant to
Section 1.9 to secure any payments to be made by the Seller pursuant to
Article VIII hereof, (b) a portion of the Earnest Money Deposit equal to the
Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be deposit in the Closing Adjustment
Escrow Account pursuant to Section 1.9 to secure any payments to be made by
the Seller pursuant to Section 1.7(b), and (c) the remainder of the Earnest
Money Deposit shall be released to the Seller. If the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not be consummated, then the Earnest
Money Deposit shall be delivered to either the Buyer or the Seller as provided
in Section 9.2. The Parties agree that for U.S. federal income Tax purposes,
the Buyer shall be treated as the owner of the Earnest Money Deposit until
either Closing occurs or this Agreement is terminated, and the Buyer shall pay
all Taxes with respect to any earnings thereon (but shall receive a
distribution of all such earnings on the earlier of (i) five (5) days after
the end of each calendar quarter, or (ii) the Closing Date). Until either the
Closing occurs or this Agreement is terminated, any earnings on the Earnest
Money Deposit shall be the property of the Buyer. If this Agreement is not
terminated prior to the Closing, ownership of the Earnest Money shall be
determined as provided in the Escrow Agreement

company duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the Laws
of the State of Delaware. The Seller is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character or location of

Adverse Effect.

(a) The Seller has all requisite power, right and authority, without the
consent of any other Person (other than as set forth on Schedule 3.6(b),
Schedule 3.7 and Schedule 3.8(a)), to execute and deliver this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and to perform its obligations
under such agreements, and there is no provision in the Seller's Certificate
of Formation and Limited Liability Company Agreement which prohibits or limits
the Seller's ability to consummate the Transactions. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and all other
instruments and certificates to be delivered at the Closing by the Seller and
the consummation by the Seller of the Transactions have been duly approved by
the board of managers of the Seller. No other proceeding on the part of the
Seller (including any consent or approval of its members) is required or
necessary to authorize this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and the other

Agreement, or the consummation of the Transactions.

(b) This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and the other instruments and
certificates to be delivered by the Seller has been (or, if to be executed or

including the Seller's Certificate of Formation and Limited Liability Company
Agreement.

subscriptions, preemptive rights, rights of first refusal, or other agreements

contemplated hereunder. No judgment, order, writ, injunction, plan or decree
of any court or other Government Authority or arbitrator affecting the Seller

Act. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) the Company, the Seller, the Buyer
and the Parent and their respective Affiliates shall not extend any waiting
period or comparable period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with
any Governmental Authority not to consummate this Agreement or the
Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the other Parties, and
(ii) the Company, the Seller, the Buyer and the Parent agree to take all
actions that are reasonably necessary or reasonably advisable to consummate
this Agreement and the Transactions.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
including Section 6.4(b), none of the Parent, the Buyer or any of their
Subsidiaries shall be required to, and the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Buyer, become subject to, consent to, or offer or
agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (i) sell, license,
assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets,
business or portion of business of the Company, the Buyer, the Parent or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or
otherwise change the assets, business or portion of business of the Company,
the Buyer, the Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in any manner,
or (iii) impose any restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of
the business or portion of the business of the Company, the Buyer, the Parent
or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided that, if requested by the
Buyer, the Company shall become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to,
or otherwise take any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long as such requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only binding on
the Company in the event the Closing occurs. Notwithstanding anything in the
contrary in this Agreement, including Section 6.4(b), none of the Parent, the
Buyer or any of their Affiliates shall be required to defend, contest or
resist any action or proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, or to
take any action to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any order,
writ, assessment, decision, injunction, decree, ruling or judgment of a
Governmental Authority, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, in
connection with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

(d) Amounts payable to the Person(s) set forth on Schedule 3.16(h) (each is a
"Disqualified Individual"), which, in the absence of shareholder approval, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would
constitute "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code shall be referred to as "280G Payments". Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall seek a vote of its shareholders (to the extent and in the manner
required under Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code), that
such person has the right to receive such payment as disclosed on Schedule
3.16(h). Prior to such vote, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain a waiver from such Disqualified Individual, such that unless
such payments are approved by the Company's shareholders to the extent and in
the manner required under Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code, no such payments shall be made.

Section 6.5 Further Assurances. Each of the Parties agrees: (a) to use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the Transactions (except as provided in Section 6.4(c), and
except that no Party shall be required to waive any conditions precedent to
Closing); (b) to execute any further documents, instruments or conveyances of
any kind that may be reasonably necessary or advisable to consummate the
Transactions, including, but not limited to, obtaining any licenses and/or
agreements from the owners of the rights to any software (including, without
limitation, commercial off the shelf software, other licensed software and
software-as-a-service) that is used or utilized by the Company immediately
prior to the Closing (the "Company Software") that are necessary to grant the
Company the right to use or utilize the Company Software, in each case in a
quantity and manner equal to the quantity and manner of a given license type
actually deployed/used by the Seller as of the Closing Date; and (c) to
cooperate with each other in connection with the foregoing. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Seller from time to time after the
Closing, at the Buyer's request, will execute, acknowledge, and deliver to the
Buyer such other instruments of assignment, conveyance and transfer and will
take such other actions and execute and deliver such other documents,
certifications, and further assurances as the Buyer may reasonably require in
order to vest more effectively in the Buyer, or to put the Buyer more fully in
possession of, any of the Purchased Shares and will take such further action
as may be necessary or desirable to effect such transfer and to otherwise
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, in each case to the extent not
inconsistent with applicable Laws. The Seller agrees to pay directly to the
applicable third party, or reimburse the Buyer or the Company, as applicable,
for, any and all third party costs, fees or expenses, including, without
limitation, transfer fees, licensing fees or penalties, that (i) might arise
prior to, as of or after Closing with regard to the Company Software as a
result of the Transactions, or (ii) must be paid prior to, as of or after
Closing in order for the Company to continue to use or utilize the Company
Software from and after the Closing Date in the same quantity or manner as
used or utilized as of the Closing Date. 

Section 6.6 Tax Covenants.

(a) Tax Returns. The Buyer or the Parent shall prepare and file, or cause to
be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns for the Company for all periods ending
after the Closing Date. In the case of Tax Returns for periods starting on or
before and ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the Buyer or
the Parent shall provide the Seller with an opportunity to review and comment
on such Tax Returns no less than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date
thereof and the Seller shall be responsible for and reimburse the Buyer within
five (5) days after such due date for all Taxes imposed on the Company shown
as due and owing on such Tax Returns that are allocable to the portion of the
Straddle Period that extends through the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing
Straddle Period"), except to the extent (i) a reserve for such Taxes has been
established and is reflected in the Financial Statements and such Taxes are
taken into account in calculating the Closing Date Net Working Capital, or
(ii) such Taxes are included in the calculation of Pre-Closing Tax Obligations
to the extent such amounts were deducted in determining the Closing Date Cash
Payment pursuant to Article I. The Seller, at its expense, shall prepare and,
following the Buyer's approval of the same (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld), file all Tax Returns required to be filed by the
Company for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing
Periods"), and shall pay (x) any Taxes owed with respect to such Tax Returns,
and (y) any installments of estimated Tax with respect to income or gain of
the Company received on or prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that
the Seller shall not be liable for or pay any Taxes (I) to the extent a
reserve for such Taxes has been established and is reflected in the Financial
Statements and such Taxes are taken into account in calculating the Closing
Date Net Working Capital, or (II) to the extent such Taxes are included in the
calculation of Pre-Closing Tax Obligations to the extent such amounts were
deducted in determining the Closing Date Cash Payment pursuant to Article I
(whether at the time specified in Section 1.8(a) or at the time specified in
Section 1.8(b), as applicable). Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
shall amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election
of the Company with respect to any Tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(b) Straddle Period Allocation. For purposes of this Section 6.6, the Taxes of
the Company for a Straddle Period shall (i) in the case of Taxes based upon or
related to income, gross income, gross receipts, sales, net profits, windfall
profits or similar items, be allocated to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period
based on a closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date and (ii) in
the case of Taxes other than Taxes described in clause (i), the amount of
Taxes allocated to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be the product of (A)
the amount of Taxes for the entire Straddle Period and (B) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Pre-Closing Straddle
Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the
entire Straddle Period.

(c) Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Parties shall cooperate fully, to the
extent reasonably requested by another Party, in connection with the filing of
Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
Party's request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant
to any such audit, litigation, or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Company and the Seller
shall (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent
to the Company relating to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date until expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by the Buyer or the Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective
Taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Taxing authority, and (ii) give the other Party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other Party so requests, the Company or the Seller, as the
case may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession of such books and
records. 

(d) Tax Sharing Agreements. Any Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
between the Company on the one hand and a Person other than the Company on the
other hand shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing
Date, the Company shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

(e) Refunds. If the Company or an Affiliate thereof actually receives a credit
with respect to, or refund of, any Tax paid by the Company prior to the
Closing with respect to any Pre-Closing Period (or portion thereof), the Buyer
shall pay over to the Seller the amount of such refund or credit within
fifteen (15) days of receipt or entitlement thereto. In the event that any
refund or credit of Taxes for which a payment has been made to the Seller
pursuant to the preceding sentence is subsequently reduced or disallowed, the
Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and the Company for any Tax
assessed against the Company, the Buyer or any Affiliate thereof by reason of
such reduction or disallowance and Seller shall make a payment to the Buyer in
such amount within fifteen (15) days of the Buyer's notice to the Seller. For
purposes of this Section 6.6(e), Tax refunds shall include any interest that
is paid as part of the payment of such refunds, reduced by increase in the
original payee's federal, state, local, foreign or other Taxes payable
attributable to such interest after taking into account any offsetting
deductions or credits.

(f) Proceedings.

(i) The Buyer shall promptly notify the Seller in writing upon receipt by the
Buyer or any Affiliate thereof of written notice of any inquiries, claims,
assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes relating to a Pre-
Closing Period for which the Seller may be liable under this Agreement or by
Law (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a "Tax
Matter"). So long as sufficient amounts remain in the Indemnity Escrow Account
to satisfy in full any amounts that may become due with respect to such Tax
Matter, the Seller, at its sole expense, shall control the defense, compromise
or other resolution of any such Tax Matter, including responding to inquiries
and contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for additional
Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating
to, such Tax Matter; provided, however, that the Seller may not enter into any
settlement of or otherwise compromise any Tax Matter that affects or may
affect the Tax liability of the Company or the Buyer or any Affiliate of the
foregoing for any period ending after the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of the Buyer, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. The Seller shall keep the Buyer fully and timely informed with
respect to the commencement, status and nature of any Tax Matter. 

(ii) The Buyer or the Parent shall represent the interests of the Company
before the relevant Taxing authority with respect to any inquiry, claim,
assessment, audit, or similar event relating to a Straddle Period (a "Straddle
Period Tax Matter") and shall control the defense, compromise or other
resolution of any such Straddle Period Tax Matter, including responding to
inquiries, filing Tax Returns and contesting, defending against and resolving
any assessment for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other
adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, such Straddle Period Tax Matter. If
the Seller would be required to indemnify the Buyer, the Company or any of
their Affiliates pursuant to Section 8.2 with respect to such Straddle Period
Tax Matter then: (A) the Seller may participate in the defense of such
Straddle Period Tax Matter and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate
from counsel employed by the Buyer, and (B) the Buyer and the Parent shall not
enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Straddle Period
Tax Matter to the extent that it adversely affects the Tax liability of the
Seller without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Buyer shall keep the Seller fully
and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any
Straddle Period Tax Matter.

Section 6.7 Insurance; Property. From the date of this Agreement to the
Closing Date, the Company and the Seller will maintain the Company's existing
insurance or obtain substantially similar coverage on presently insured
property (real, personal, and mixed) owned or leased by the Company; and all
such property will be used, operated, maintained, and repaired in the Ordinary
Course of Business.

Section 6.8 Administration of Accounts. All payments and reimbursements
received by the Seller, or any Affiliate of the Seller after the Closing Date
from any third party in the name of the Company, for the benefit of the
Company, or in connection with the Company or the Business, shall be held by
the Seller or such Affiliate in trust for the benefit of the Company.
Immediately upon receipt of such payment or reimbursement, the Seller shall
pay to the Buyer the amount of such payment or reimbursement.

Section 6.9 No Solicitation; Exclusivity. Between the date of this Agreement
and the earlier to occur of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, neither the Company nor the Seller shall,
and the Company and the Seller shall not permit any of their Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees or Representatives to, directly or indirectly,
(a) solicit or consider any inquiries, proposals or offers, or enter into
agreements, relating to the disposition of the Purchased Shares, Assets or the
Business of the Company, the merger or consolidation of the Company with any
Person, the sale or exchange of any securities of the Company, or any other
business combination, or (b) divulge or otherwise disclose any confidential
information concerning the Business or the Assets to any third Person (other
than in the Ordinary Course) or any details regarding the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 6.10 Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification. For a period of
six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Company's Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws shall contain provisions no less favorable than those set forth in
the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as of the date hereof with
respect to exculpation or indemnification of any current or former officer,
manager, director or similar functionary (unless required by Law) in respect
of acts, omissions or events occurring on or prior to Closing, it being the
intent of the Parties that such officers, managers, directors and similar
functionaries of the Company shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation
and indemnification in respect of acts, omissions or events occurring on or
prior to Closing to the fullest extent of the Law. The provisions of this
Section 6.10 are intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
current and former officer, director, manager or similar functionary of the
Company and his or her heirs and representatives, and are in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such person may have had by contract or otherwise. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company and the Seller shall obtain, at the expense of the
Company, "tail" policies in respect of existing policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company, for a period of six
(6) years after the Closing Date, to provide insurance coverage for events,
acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date for all Persons
who were directors or officers of the Company on or prior to the Closing Date. 

Section 6.11 Contact with Employees, Customers and Suppliers. Prior to the
Closing, neither the Buyer nor any of the Buyer's Representatives shall
contact or otherwise communicate with any employees, customers or suppliers of
the Company in connection with or regarding the Transactions contemplated
hereby, except to the extent approved in advance in writing by Jack Warden,
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld.

Section 6.12 Control of the Company's or the Buyer's Operations. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give the Parent or the Buyer, on the one
hand, or the Company, on the other hand, directly or indirectly, rights to
control or direct the operations of the other prior to the Closing. Prior to
the Closing, each of the Parent and the Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision of its
respective operations.

Section 6.13 Confidentiality. The Seller acknowledges the confidential and
proprietary nature of the Company Confidential Information and agrees, that
from and for eighteen (18) month period after the Closing, the Seller shall:
(a) keep the Company Confidential Information confidential, (b) not use the
Company Confidential Information for any reason or purpose; and (c) without
limiting the foregoing, not disclose the Confidential Information to any
Person, except with the Buyer's prior written consent; provided, however, that
the Seller's obligations under this Section 6.13 with respect to any Company
Confidential Information that is a Trade Secret shall survive indefinitely.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision contained herein, the Seller
shall have the right to disclose any part of the Company Confidential
Information to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to (w) pursue any
right or Claim for Losses arising under this Agreement, (x) defend against any
Claim for Losses asserted against it under this Agreement, (y) defend against
any third party claim relating to its ownership of the Company prior to the
Closing, and (z) file any Tax Returns or respond to any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. This Section 6.13 shall not apply to
that part of the Company Confidential Information that becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Section
6.13 by the Seller. Company Confidential Information shall not be deemed
"generally available to the public" merely because it is included or
incorporated in more general information that is publicly available or because
it combines features which individually may be publicly available. If the
Seller becomes compelled in any action or proceeding to make any disclosure
that is prohibited by this Section 6.13, the Seller shall, to the extent
legally permissible, provide the Buyer with prompt notice of such compulsion
so that the Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or other
appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section
6.13. In the absence of a protective order or other remedy, the Seller may
disclose that portion (and only that portion) of the Company Confidential
Information that, based upon advice of the Seller's counsel, the Seller is
reasonably likely to be legally compelled to disclose; provided, however, that
the Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain written assurance that
any Person to whom any Company Confidential Information is so disclosed shall
accord confidential treatment to such Company Confidential Information.
Nothing in this Section 6.13 shall diminish the protections and benefits under
applicable Law to which any Trade Secret of the Company is entitled. If any
information that the Buyer, the Parent or the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries asserts to be a Trade Secret under applicable Law is found by a
court of competent jurisdiction not to be such a Trade Secret, such
information shall nonetheless be considered Company Confidential Information
for purposes of this Section 6.13. 

Section 6.14 Interim Financial Statements. During the period prior to the
Closing Date, (a) within fifteen (15) days after the end of each fiscal month,
the Company shall deliver to the Buyer an unaudited balance sheet of the
Company as of the last day of the most recently completed fiscal month and
unaudited statements of income of the Company for the most recently completed
fiscal month and for the period from December 28, 2013 to the end of the most
recently completed fiscal month, and (b) within thirty (30) days after the
last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company ended at least thirty (30) days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer an unaudited
balance sheet of the Company as of the last day of such fiscal quarter and
statements of income, cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity of the
Company for the interim period between the date of the latest audited balance
sheet (e.g., December 28, 2013) and the last day of such fiscal quarter (and
for the corresponding period of the preceding fiscal year of the Company),
with each of the financial statements in clause (b) of this Section 6.14
reviewed in accordance with AU Section 722 Interim Financial Information,
meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X for a Form S-1 registration
statement (other than Rules 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X) and being in a
form that will enable the independent auditors of the Company to render a
customary "comfort letter" (including customary "negative assurances"). From
and after the Closing, the Seller shall cooperate fully to provide relevant
information relating to Pre-Closing Periods, to the extent reasonably
requested by the Buyer or the Buyer, in connection with the Buyer's
preparation of monthly, quarterly or other interim balance sheets, statements
of income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for periods ending
after the Closing Date (and for the corresponding period of the preceding
fiscal year).

Section 6.15 Title Commitments, Title Policies, Surveys and Zoning Letters. In
the event requested by the Buyer, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Buyer or the Parent in obtaining,
with respect to each parcel of Company Real Estate (a) ALTA or other form of
title commitment for owner's, lessee's and/or lender's policies (if
applicable) of title insurance (each, a "Title Commitment") prepared by a
national title insurance company acceptable to the Buyer ("Title Company"),
(b) certified ALTA/ACSM or other on-the-ground, staked, boundary survey maps
of the Owned Real Property, or any portion thereof, prepared by surveyors
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and reflecting the matters disclosed on the
Title Commitment related thereto; and (c) letters from the appropriate
Governmental Authority in the locations where each parcel of Company Real
Estate is located certifying zoning compliance of such Company Real Estate, as
applicable. If requested by the Buyer, the Company shall deliver at the
Closing an owner's affidavit of title with respect to each parcel of Company
Real Estate, in form and substance required by Title Company, and such other
transfer declarations, GAP undertakings, title clearance, and corporate
authority documents required by Title Company to issue at Closing 2006 ALTA
owner's, lessee's and lender's policies of title insurance (extended coverage
policies, including mechanic's lien coverage) on the Company Real Estate as
requested by the Buyer, including such endorsements required by the Buyer
(each a "Title Policy" and collectively the "Title Policies"). The Company
shall also cooperate fully with the Buyer to satisfy or accomplish all
requirements of policy issuance required by the Title Company and to eliminate
such exceptions from the Title Policies as the Buyer may desire eliminated. 

Section 6.16 Lease Estoppels; Landlord Lien Waivers; and Non-Disturbance
Agreements. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
and deliver to the Buyer at Closing (a) certificates of estoppel in a form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Buyer from each party (lessors,
lessees, and sublessees, as applicable) to each Lease (other than the
Company); (b) if requested by the Buyer, non-disturbance agreements from each
lender of a landlord/lessor under each Lease in form and substance acceptable
to the Buyer; and (c) if required by the Buyer's lender, access and waiver of
lien agreements, in form acceptable to such lender, from the landlords/lessors
under the Leases agreeing that any trade fixtures, machinery, equipment,
furniture, inventory, goods or other personal property kept at or installed in
the Leased Real Property is personal property, is not to become a part of the
realty no matter how affixed to it, may be removed from the Leased Real
Property by such lender at any time free and clear of any claim or lien of
such landlord/lessor and such additional matters as may reasonably be
requested by such lender to protect its interest in such personal property
(each an "Access Agreement"). In the absence of any such estoppels, the
Company shall provide at Closing the estoppel for any Leased Real Property for
which the third party estoppel is not received and each such estoppel shall be
deemed an Ancillary Agreement under this Agreement and a deliverable under
Section 2.2(a). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, delivery of
each Access Agreement to the Buyer on or before Closing shall be deemed a
deliverable under Section 2.2(a).

Section 6.17 Amendments to LLC Agreement. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller shall amend the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company
Agreement of the Seller dated as of February, 2010 (as it may have been
further amended or restated from time to time) (the "Seller LLC Agreement") to
provide that the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Seller
shall not cause the Seller to be dissolved, its assets disposed of and its
affairs wound up and the Seller shall provide evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Buyer that such amendment was accomplished in accordance with the terms
of the Seller LLC Agreement and applicable Law. The Seller shall not dissolve
or wind up its affairs or take any action which would require that it be
dissolved or wind up its affairs for a period of eighteen (18) months after
the Closing Date.

Section 6.18 Required Amendments. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and
the Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required
Amendments and shall keep the Buyer advised as to the status thereof.

Section 3.3 (Capitalization), Section 3.22 (Brokers), Section 4.4 (Title of
Shares), Section 4.2 (Authority; Enforceability), Section 5.2 (Authority;
Enforceability), Section 5.6 (Brokers) and Section 5.7 (Ability to Perform)
(collectively, the "Fundamental Representations") will survive indefinitely.
Any claim (whether or not fixed as to liability or liquidated as to amount)
pending on the expiration date of the applicable survival period set forth
above for which a claim notice has been given in accordance with Section 8.2
on or before such expiration date may continue to be asserted and shall be
indemnified against until finally resolved. All covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing in accordance with their
terms, or if no term is expressly stated, upon the expiration of the statute
of limitations period applicable to the matters covered thereby. 

Section 8.2 Indemnification.

(a) By the Seller. The Company shall, until the Closing, and the Seller shall,
after the Closing, indemnify, save, and hold harmless the Buyer, the Parent
and their Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) and their
respective Representatives, successors, and assigns from and against any and
all costs, losses, Taxes, Liabilities, obligations, damages, Actions, and
expenses (whether or not arising out of third-party claims), including
reasonable attorneys' fees (collectively, "Losses") asserted, incurred in
connection with, arising out of, resulting from or incident to:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company or the
Seller in or pursuant to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, or in any
certificate or other closing document delivered pursuant to this Agreement;

(ii) any failure by the Company or the Seller to perform or observe any
covenant or agreement to be performed or observed by any of them under this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate or other closing
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement;

(iii) any Taxes or costs (A) relating to Pre-Closing Periods or Pre-Closing
Straddle Periods, (B) any Pre-Closing Tax Obligations, or (C) arising as a
result of any failure by the Seller to pay any Taxes payable pursuant to
Section 6.6;

(iv) any payment to any of the Company's current or former officers, managers,
directors and similar functionaries under the provisions of (A) the Company's
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, or (B) the Buyer's Certificate of
Formation and Limited Liability Company agreement, in either case with respect
to exculpation or indemnification of such officers, managers, directors or
similar functionaries in respect of acts, omissions or events occurring on or
prior to Closing;

(v) any unpaid Closing Date Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses;

(vi) obtaining the Non-Closing Condition Amendments (less an amount equal to
20% of any such costs); 

(vii) any matters, actions, disputes, claims, relationships or business
dealings which were the subject of the Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release
of Claims described in Schedule 3.12;

(viii) those matters specifically set forth on Schedule 8.2(a)(viii); and

(ix) any failure of the Seller to vote in favor of the matters described in
Section 6.4(d).

(b) By the Buyer. The Buyer shall indemnify and save and hold harmless the
Seller and its Representatives, successors, and assigns from and against any
and all Losses asserted, incurred in connection with, arising out of,
resulting from, or incident to: (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty made by the Buyer in or pursuant to this Agreement or in any
certificate or other closing document delivered pursuant to this Agreement,
(ii) any failure by the Buyer or the Parent to perform or observe any covenant
or agreement to be performed or observed by the Buyer or the Parent under this
Agreement or in any certificate or other closing document delivered pursuant
to this Agreement, and (iii) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
any Taxes of the Company relating to periods following the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.2(b), the Buyer's
and the Parent's maximum aggregate liability for claims of Losses under this
Section 8.2(b) will not exceed the General Cap; provided, however, that the
General Cap shall not apply with respect to any Losses relating to breaches of
Section 5.2 (Authority; Enforceability) and/or Section 5.6 (Brokers).

(c) Claims for Indemnification.

(i) If a claim for Losses (a "Claim") is made by a Party entitled to
indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") against the Party
obligated to provide indemnification for such Claim hereunder (the
"Indemnifying Party"), the Indemnified Party will give written notice (a
"Claim Notice") to the Indemnifying Party and the Escrow Agent as soon as
practicable after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition
or event which may give rise to Losses for which indemnification may be sought
under this Section 8.2. The Claim Notice shall contain (A) a description and
the amount of any Losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the
Indemnified Party, (B) a statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b), as applicable, for
such Losses and a reasonable explanation of the basis therefor, and (C) a
demand for payment in the amount of such Losses. The failure of any
Indemnified Party to give a timely Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party
under this Agreement will not affect its rights to indemnification under this
Agreement, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates
actual damage caused by such failure. If the Seller or the Buyer, as
applicable, fails to notify the Indemnified Party within sixty (60) days
following receipt of a Claim Notice from such Indemnified Party that it
disputes the Claim therein, the Claim set forth in the Claim Notice shall be
conclusively deemed a liability to be indemnified under this Section 8.2, and
the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified for the amount of the Losses stated
in such Claim Notice on demand. 

(ii) If any third-party files any lawsuit or enforcement action or otherwise
asserts a claim against any Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall
give a Claim Notice of such action to the Indemnifying Party as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within fifteen (15) days after the service of
the citation or summons). The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely
notice of a third party action to the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement
will not affect its rights to indemnification under this Agreement, except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates actual damage caused by
such failure. After such notice, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled, if
it so elects, (A) to take control of the defense and investigation of such
lawsuit or action, and (B) to employ and engage attorneys of its choice that
are reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to handle and defend the
same; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party may not assume the
defense of a third-party Claim if (x) the Indemnifying Party is the Company
(prior to Closing) or the Seller, and (I) a reasonable assessment of the
likely amount of such Claim is in excess of the sum of the amount of the funds
then on deposit in the Indemnification Escrow Account, or (II) such Claim is
asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is a supplier or customer
of the Company, or (y) such Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party. Any Indemnified Party shall have the
right to employ separate counsel in any such Claim and to participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be
entitled to indemnity hereunder unless (1) the Indemnifying Party shall have
failed, within thirty (30) days after having been notified in writing by the
Indemnified Party of the existence of such Claim as provided in this Section
8.2(c)(i), to assume and continue to diligently conduct the defense of such
Claim, (2) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized by
the Indemnifying Party or (3) the representation of the Indemnified Party by
counsel provided by the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to
actual or potential conflicting interests between them, including situations
in which there are one or more material legal defenses available to the
Indemnified Party that are not available to Indemnifying Party. No
Indemnifying Party shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect
of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the
Indemnified Party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim)
unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (a) includes only monetary
damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, (b) includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such action or claim and (c) does not include a statement as to, or an
admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party. In no event will an Indemnified Party consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any Claim for
which the Indemnified Party is liable hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

(iii) Subject to the limitations in this Article VIII, in the event that the
Buyer or its Affiliates is the Indemnified Party, and once the amount of
Losses has been agreed to by the Seller or finally adjudicated to be payable
by the Seller pursuant to this Article VIII, (A) such Losses shall first be
satisfied from the Indemnification Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement by the transfer from the Escrow Agent to the Indemnified
Party of an amount equal to the amount of such Losses, and (B) subject to the
limitations in this Article VIII, if such Losses exceed the value of the
remaining balance in the Indemnification Escrow Account (if any), and the
Seller is liable therefor, the Seller shall pay the unsatisfied portion of
such Losses, in either case, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account designated in writing by the Indemnified Party within five (5)
Business Days after the amount of Losses has been determined hereunder. 

(iv) Subject to the limitations in this Article VIII, in the event that Seller
or its Affiliates is the Indemnified Party, and once the amount of Losses has
been agreed to by the Buyer or finally adjudicated to be payable by the Buyer
pursuant to this Article VIII, the Buyer shall pay the amount of such Losses
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in
writing by the Indemnified Party within five (5) Business Days after the
amount of Losses has been determined hereunder.

(d) Exclusive Remedy. The indemnification given by the Parties under this
Agreement shall be the Parties' sole and exclusive post-Closing remedy, each
against the other, with respect to all Losses incurred by a Party hereunder,
except for any claims arising out of or relating to the fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, or wrongful act of any Party.

(e) Limitations.

(i) Limited Claims. Subject to Section 8.2(e)(ii), (1) the Seller will have no
liability under Section 8.2(a)(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of all
claims for Losses under Section 8.2(a)(i) exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Basket
Amount"), at which time the Seller will be liable only for Losses under
Section 8.2(a)(i) that exceed the Basket Amount (provided, however, the first
ten (10) individual items, or series of related items arising from the same or
similar circumstances, where the Loss under Section 8.2(a)(i) is less than
$25,000 (the "Mini Basket Amount") shall not be indemnified for or against and
shall not count towards the Basket Amount, but any individual items or series
of related items not captured by the Mini Basket Amount shall count toward the
Basket Amount), and (2) the maximum aggregate liability of the Seller for
claims of Losses under Section 8.2(a)(i) will not exceed $14,000,000 (the
"General Cap").

(ii) Other Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Basket Amount, Mini
Basket Amount and General Cap shall not apply to Losses (and claims thereof)
under Section 8.2(a)(ii), Section 8.2(a)(iii), Section 8.2(a)(iv), Section
8.2(a)(v), and (B) the Basket Amount, Mini Basket Amount and General Cap shall
not apply to Losses (and claims thereof) relating to breaches of the
Fundamental Representations. The Basket Amount and the Mini Basket Amount
shall not apply to Losses (and claims thereof) under Section 8.2(a)(vi),
Section 8.2(a)(vii), Section 8.2(a)(viii) and Section 8.2(a)(ix), but shall in
each case be subject to the General Cap. The maximum aggregate liability of
the Seller for such Losses under this Section 8.2(e)(ii) shall be
$128,000,000.

(iii) Exclusions from Losses. In no event shall any Indemnified Party under
this Section 8.2 be entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in
respect of, and in no event shall "Losses" be deemed to include, (A) any
special, indirect, punitive, aggravated damages, except to the extent that
such damages are based upon a willful breach or fraudulent misrepresentation
by the Company or the Seller or included in any third party action (provided,
however, for avoidance of doubt, Losses shall be deemed to include
consequential damages), or (B) any loss, liability, damage or expense to the
extent included in the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital,
Transaction Expenses or Closing Date Indebtedness. 

(iv) Materiality. For the purposes of determining whether there has occurred
any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty and he amount of
Losses due to a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty, all
"Material Adverse Effect" or "Material Adverse Change" qualifications and
other materiality qualifications contained in such representations and
warranties shall be disregarded.

(f) Insurance and Tax Effect. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification hereunder or of any Claim therefore shall be calculated net of
(i) any amounts actually theretofore recovered by an Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any non-
affiliated third party (net of all direct collection expenses), (ii) any
insurance proceeds or other non-affiliated third party cash receipts or
sources of reimbursement actually theretofore received by an Indemnified Party
against such Loss (net of all direct collection expenses) on account of such
Loss (each such source named in clauses (i) and (ii), a "Collateral Source"),
(iii) any Tax Benefit (as defined below) actually realized by such Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates on account of such Loss, and (iv) shall be increased
by the amount of an Tax Detriment actually suffered by such Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates on account of such Loss. If such Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates actually realizes a Tax Benefit after an indemnification payment is
made to such Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to
the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time or times as
and to the extent that such Tax Benefit is realized. For purposes hereof, "Tax
Benefit" shall mean any refund of Taxes paid or reduction in the amount of
Taxes which otherwise would have been paid to the Indemnified Party, and "Tax
Detriment" shall mean any additional Taxes or costs paid or increase in the
amount of Taxes which otherwise would have been paid by the Indemnified Party.
The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek full
recovery of any Loss from all Collateral Sources covering such Loss to the
same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification
hereunder. In the event that a recovery from a Collateral Source is made by
such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates with respect to any Loss for which
any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of the recovery (net of all direct collection expenses) shall
be made promptly to the Indemnifying Party.

(g) Duty to Mitigate. Nothing in this Agreement in any way restricts or limits
the general obligation at Law of an Indemnified Party to mitigate any Loss
which it may suffer or incur by reason of the breach by an Indemnifying Party
of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Indemnifying
Party under this Agreement; provided that, neither the Buyer nor the Company
shall have any duty to pay any Taxes or file any Tax Return for which the
Seller is liable or responsible under this Agreement to mitigate the accrual
of penalties and interest on such Taxes or with respect to such Tax Return.

Section 8.3 Release.

(a) The Seller, on behalf of itself and its members, trustees, agents,
attorneys, representatives, successors, assigns, heirs, beneficiaries,
creditors and Affiliates (collectively, the "Releasing Parties"), hereby,
irrevocably and unconditionally, fully and forever acquit, release, covenant
not to sue, discharge and agree to hold harmless the Company, the Buyer, the
Parent, and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders,
members, managers, employees, agents, attorneys, representatives,
predecessors, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Releasees"), from any
and all commitments, actions, debts, claims, counterclaims, charges, demands,
damages, losses, compensation, obligations, Liabilities, costs, expenses
(including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and court costs), causes of
action, debts, contracts, torts, covenants, fiduciary duties,
responsibilities, suits and judgments, at law or in equity, of every nature
and kind that any of the Releasing Parties have, may have had or may have in
the future against the Releasees, whether known or unknown, for all matters
relating to, arising out of or in connection with the status of the Seller or
any of the Releasing Parties as a shareholder, creditor, officer and/or
director of the Company from the beginning of time through the Closing Date
(collectively, for the purposes of this Section 8.3, the "Causes of Action"),
except as specifically set forth in this Agreement. The release set forth in
this Section 8.3 shall be binding upon the Releasing Parties and their
respective successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the
Releasees and their respective successors and assigns. 

(b) The Seller, on behalf of itself and the other Releasing Parties, hereby
represents to the Releasees that the Releasing Parties (i) have not assigned
any Causes of Action or possible Causes of Action against any Releasee, (ii)
fully intend to release all Causes of Action against the Releasees including,
without limitation, unknown and contingent Causes of Action (other than those
specifically reserved above), and (iii) have consulted with counsel with
respect to the execution and delivery of this general release and has been
fully apprised of the consequences hereof.

(c) The Seller hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, and to cause the
other Releasing Parties to refrain from, directly or indirectly, (i) asserting
any Causes of Action, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced,
or continuing with any claim, action or proceeding for a Cause of Action, and
this Agreement may be raised by any Releasee as an estoppel to any such
claims, actions or proceedings; and (ii) making any claim or commencing any
action or proceeding against any Person (or assisting or encouraging any other
Person in connection therewith) in which any claim, action or proceeding would
arise against any Releasee for contribution or indemnity or other relief from,
over and against any Releasee or which otherwise results in a Releasee
suffering or incurring any Losses, whether under common law, equity, statute,
Contract or otherwise, with respect a Cause of Action. It is the intention of
the Seller, on behalf of itself and the other Releasing Parties, that the
release described in this Section 8.3 be effective as a bar to each Cause of
Action hereinabove specified. In furtherance of this intention the Seller
hereby expressly waives, and shall cause each of the other Releasing Parties
to waive, any and all rights and benefits conferred upon it by the provisions
of Applicable Law with respect to any Cause of Action and the Seller, on
behalf of itself and the other Releasing Parties, expressly consents that the
release described in this Section 8.3 shall be given full force and effect
according to each and all of its express terms and provisions.

(d) The Seller shall deliver to the Buyer at the Closing a release agreement
in form reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer re-affirming its obligations
under this Section 8.3 and extending the coverage of the release for the
Releasing Parties set forth in this Section 8.3 to include the period from the
date hereof through and including the Closing (the "Release Agreement").

Section 8.4 Disclosure Generally. The Disclosure Schedules have been arranged,
for purposes of convenience only, as separately titled Schedules corresponding
to the Sections of Article III and Article IV. Any information set forth in
any Disclosure Schedule or incorporated in any Section of this Agreement shall
be considered to have been set forth in each other Schedule and shall be
deemed to modify the representations and warranties in Article III or Article
IV, as applicable, whether or not such representations and warranties refer to
such Schedule, but only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the
face of the Schedule that it applies to a particular representation and
warranty. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item
in the Disclosure Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts, or
higher or lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are
not required to be disclosed or are within or outside of the ordinary course
of business, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or
the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Disclosure Schedules in any
dispute or controversy with any Party as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in a Disclosure Schedule is or is not
required to be disclosed (including, without limitation, whether such amounts
are required to be disclosed as material) or in the ordinary course of
business for the purposes of this Agreement. The information contained in the
Disclosure Schedules is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement,
and no information contained therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any
Party hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever, including of any
violation of Law or breach of any agreement. 

Section 8.5 Independent Significance. The Parties intend that each
representation, warranty, covenant and agreement contained in this Agreement
has independent significance. If any Party has breached any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement in any respect,
the fact that there exists another representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) which the Party has not breached shall not detract from
or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

Section 8.6 No Contribution. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
after the Closing the Seller shall not have, and it hereby irrevocably waives,
any claims, causes of action and rights to sue or seek contribution,
reimbursement or indemnification against or from the Buyer, the Parent or the
Company for any Losses incurred, suffered, paid, sustained or indemnified by
the Seller in connection with, arising out of, based upon, relating to or
otherwise involving this Agreement, including any breach by the Company of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION; REMEDIES

Section 9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Seller and the Buyer;

(b) by either the Seller or the Buyer, by delivery of written notice of such
termination to the other, if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or
before January 1, 2015 (the "Termination Date"), unless the Termination Date
is extended by written agreement of the Seller and the Buyer; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b)
shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur on or prior to such date (for the purposes of the proviso,
the failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement by the Company or
the Seller shall be deemed the failure of the Seller and the Company); 

(c) by the Seller, by delivery of written notice of such termination to the
Buyer, if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
made by the Buyer or the Parent in this Agreement, such that any condition in
Section 7.2 would not be satisfied and which has not been cured by the Buyer
or the Parent, as applicable, within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt
of written notice from the Seller requesting such breach to be cured (if
reasonably curable in such time frame, and if not, reasonable steps to cure
have not been take in such time frame); provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) shall not be
available to the Seller if the failure of the Company or the Seller to fulfill
any of their obligations under this Agreement has been the primary cause of,
or resulted in, such breach;

(d) by the Buyer, by delivery of written notice of such termination to the
Seller, if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
made by the Company or the Seller in this Agreement, such that any condition
in Section 7.1 would not be satisfied and which has not been cured by the
Company or the Seller, as applicable, within fifteen (15) Business Days after
receipt of written notice from the Buyer requesting such breach to be cured
(if reasonably curable in such time frame, and if not, reasonable steps to
cure have not been take in such time frame); provided, however, that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) shall not be
available to the Buyer if the failure of the Buyer or the Parent to fulfill
any of its obligations under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or
resulted in, such breach; or

(e) by either the Seller or the Buyer, if any Governmental Authority shall
have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have become final and nonappealable.

Section 9.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) Except as provided in Section 9.2(b), if this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1, all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder
shall terminate and no Party shall have any liability to the other Party,
except for obligations of the Parties in Section 1.12 (Earnest Money), Section
6.3 (Confidential Information), this Section 9.2 (Effect of Termination),
Section 10.2 (Notices), Section 10.3 (Choice of Law; Venue and Forum) and
Section 10.6 (Expenses), which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement; provided, however, except as provided in Section 9.2(b), nothing
herein shall relieve any Party from liability do to the extent that such
termination results from fraud or the intentional breach or misrepresentation
by such Party. 

(b) Except as set forth in the next sentence, if this Agreement is terminated
for any reason, the Earnest Money Deposit shall be delivered to the Buyer (and
the Buyer and the Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to do so within two (2) Business Days following any such
termination of this Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Earnest
Money Deposit shall be delivered to the Seller in the event the Seller
terminates this Agreement pursuant to (i) Section 9.1(b), but only if the
Buyer's or the Parent's failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on
or prior to the Termination Date, or (ii) Section 9.1(c) and, in either case,
the Buyer and the Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to do so within two (2) Business Days following any such
termination of this Agreement). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect
to any termination of this Agreement under circumstances in which the Earnest
Money Deposit is payable to the Seller as provided in the preceding sentence,
payment of the Earnest Money Deposit to the Seller shall constitute liquidated
damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim which the
Company or the Seller would otherwise be entitled to assert against the Buyer,
the Parent or any of their Affiliates or Representatives or any of their
respective assets, with respect to any such termination of this Agreement, and
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller, the Company or
any other Person with respect to any such termination of this Agreement for
any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or the failure of the Transactions to be consummated,
and upon payment of such amount, none of the Buyer, the Parent or any of their
Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that, in light
of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the
foregoing upon any such termination of this Agreement under circumstances in
which the Earnest Money Deposit is payable to the Seller pursuant to this
Section 9.2(b), the right to such payment: (A) constitutes a reasonable
estimate of the damages that will be suffered by reason of any such
termination of this Agreement, and (B) shall be in full and complete
satisfaction of any and all damages arising as a result of any such
termination of this Agreement.
