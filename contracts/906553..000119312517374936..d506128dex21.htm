mutual representations, warranties and covenants contained herein and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, agree as follows:

ARTICLE I. 

PURCHASE AND SALE OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS; CUSTOMER

 

INFORMATION; FURTHER ACTIONS

 

Section 1.01 _Joinder_. Sellers will, and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause Sellers to, execute and deliver the Joinder to Purchaser to
become a party to this Agreement at or prior to Closing. Sellers shall not be
a "party" or "parties" to this Agreement and shall make no representations or
warranties hereunder and shall have no rights or obligations hereunder until
the Joinder is executed by Sellers and delivered to Purchaser.

Section 1.02 _Purchase and Sale of _ _Membership Interests_. Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing,
Sellers shall sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase and accept from
Sellers, the Membership Interests, free and clear of all Liens (other than
restrictions arising under applicable securities Laws or Gaming Laws).

Section 1.03 _Customer Database and Information_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller will, to the extent practicable, (i) remove
from its enterprise-wide customer database the Casino Database Records of
customers referenced in Sellers enterprise-wide database records as of ten
(10) calendar days prior to the Closing Date as only having visited one or
more of the Casinos (" _Divestiture Only Customers_ "), (ii) remove from each
Property Database records of customers who have no transaction history at any
of the Casinos as of ten (10) calendar days prior to the Closing Date (" _Non-
Casino Customers_") and (iii) transfer any Casino Database Records located on
Sellers enterprise-wide database and not on a Property Database to the
appropriate Property Database.

 



2 (b) From and after the Closing Date, for Shared Customers (to the extent
practicable):

 

(i) Seller and its Affiliates may retain and use the Retained Database Records
of the Shared Customers, but not the Casino Database Records of the Shared
Customers (other than the Casino Database Records described in items (a), (d)
and (e) of the definition of Casino Database Records (the " _Permitted Casino
Records_ ")) and, prior to the Closing, Seller shall remove from such records
the Casino Database Records (other than the Permitted Casino Records) with
respect to the Shared Customers (it being understood that such information
shall be removed with respect to each applicable Casino). For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict Parent or its Affiliates
from retaining and using any information, including, the Retained Database
Records, with respect to any Non-Casino Customer; and

(ii) Purchaser and its Affiliates may retain and use the Casino Database
Records of the Shared Customers, but not the Retained Database Records of the
Shared Customers (other than the Retained Database Records described in items
(a), (d) and (e) of the definition of Retained Database Records (the "
_Permitted Retained Records_ ")) and, prior to the Closing, Seller shall
remove from each Property Database the Retained Database Records (other than
the Permitted Retained Records) with respect to the Shared Customers. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict Purchaser or its
Affiliates from retaining and using any information, including, the Casino
Database Records, with respect to any Divestiture Only Customer.

 

(c) Seller shall not provide Parent or its Affiliates with a copy of the
records contained in the customer databases that Seller maintains at a Casino
specific to such Casino (each such database, a " _Property Database_ ");
_provided_ , that, prior to the Closing, Seller shall remove all, and only
the, Retained Database Records (other than the Permitted Retained
Records) from each such Property Database.

(d) At the Closing, Seller shall transfer and deliver, or cause to be
transferred and delivered, to the extent practicable, (i) to Purchaser the
Casino Database Records of Divestiture Only Customers and Shared Customers and
(ii) to Parent by operation of the Merger the Retained Database Records of all
customers (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, Casino Database Records of
Divestiture Only Customers and Shared Customers) to Parent.

(e) From and after the Closing:

 

(i) (x) Parent and its Affiliates may not use the Casino Database Records
(other than the Permitted Casino Records) and (y) Purchaser and its
Affiliates may not use any Retained Database Records (other than the Permitted
Retained Records).

 

(ii) In the event that any party becomes aware that it or the other party
possesses any Casino Database Records other than Permitted Casino Records (in
the case of Parent) or Retained Database Records other than Permitted Retained
Records (in the case of Boyd) or any other information in contravention of
this _Section_ __ _ 1.03_, then the party possessing such information shall
(x) safeguard and not use such information for any purpose or in any manner,
(y) treat such information as Confidential Information in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.08_, and (z) promptly notify the other party thereof,
transfer

 



3  such information to the other party and remove such information from such
partys systems and databases.

 

(f) The foregoing notwithstanding, (i) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
either provide or make available to Parent and its Affiliates any information
contained in the Casino Database Records and (ii) Parent shall either provide
or make available to Boyd and its Affiliates any information contained in the
Retained Database Records, in the case of (i) and (ii), to the extent that
such information is necessary to ensure compliance with Law or other legal
obligations or to defend or prosecute actual or potential litigation. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be required to take any actions pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 1.03_ that are inconsistent with its obligations
under any Orders binding on Seller and/or its Subsidiaries under applicable
Law.

 

Section 1.04 _Later Identified Assets_ _and Liabilities_. If, after the
Closing, either Boyd or Parent in good faith identifies any asset of Parent
or its Subsidiaries that was primarily used in the Business prior to the
Closing (other than leasehold interests in real property under the Purchaser
Master Lease, the Seller Master Lease and services that may be provided
under the Transition Services Agreement) and that was not held by any of the
Companies when the Membership Interests were transferred at Closing (any such
asset, a " _Later Identified Asset_ "), then either Boyd or Parent, as
applicable, will provide written notice to the other party identifying such
Later Identified Asset and Parent will, as promptly as practicable thereafter,
transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Purchaser (or cause to be transferred,
conveyed, assigned, or delivered to Purchaser) all right, title and interest
of Parent and its Subsidiaries in and to such Later Identified Asset, and such
Later Identified Assets will be deemed to have been assets of the Companies
for purposes of this Agreement and any applicable Ancillary Agreement,
effective as of the date of transfer, conveyance, assignment, or delivery. If,
after the Closing, either Boyd or Parent in good faith identifies any
Liability of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than Retained Liabilities)
relating to, arising out of or resulting from the Business or the operation of
the Companies (including Liabilities of the Companies under any leases,
Liabilities of the Companies arising out of or relating to any litigation or
other third party actions relating to the Business or the operation of the
Companies, environmental Liabilities or obligations of the Companies, any
Liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from the Contracts,
agreements, real property, information technology, Permits and licenses of
Seller relating to the Business operation of the Companies, and any
Liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from the gaming equipment
and inventory included in the Purchased Assets, but excluding all Liabilities
of Parent or its Subsidiaries under the Seller Master Lease), whether such
Liability arose pre- or post-Closing, that was not assumed by any of the
Companies when the Membership Interests were transferred at Closing (any such
asset, a " _Later Identified Liability_ "), then either Boyd or Parent, as
applicable, will provide written notice to the other party identifying such
Later Identified Liability and Parent will, as promptly as practicable
thereafter, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Boyd or its designated
Affiliate (or cause to be transferred, conveyed, assigned, or delivered to
Boyd or its designated Affiliate), and Boyd shall, or shall cause its
designated Affiliate to, assume and accept, all such Later Identified
Liabilities, and all such Later Identified Liabilities will be deemed to have
been liabilities of the Companies for purposes of this Agreement and any
applicable Ancillary Agreement, effective as of the date of transfer,
conveyance, assignment or delivery.

 



4 ARTICLE II.

 

PURCHASE PRICE

 

Section 2.01 _Purchase Price_.

 

(a) At the Closing, as consideration for the Membership Interests and for
Parents other obligations hereunder, Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Payment Recipient by electronic transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Payment Recipient a cash
payment equal to the sum of (a) $573,834,000 (the " _Base Purchase Price_ "),
_plus_ (b) the EBITDA Adjustment as determined in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.01(b)_, _plus_ (c) Cage Cash _plus_ (d) the Estimated Adjustment (which
may be a positive or negative number) (such sum, the "Closing Payment").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if pursuant to the proviso of _Section_ __ _
10.01(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.02(c)_ Purchaser shall not be obligated
to acquire any Excluded Company at the Closing, then (i) the Base Purchase
Price will be reduced by the applicable Company Purchase Price Allocation for
such Excluded Company, (ii) the EBITDA Adjustment will be reduced or
increased, as applicable, to reflect the removal of the 2017 Company EBITDA
for such Excluded Company from the calculation of 2017 EBITDA and (iii) the
calculation of the Estimated Adjustment (and the related components thereof)
and the adjustment calculation and mechanisms described in _Article III_ ,
and the Cash Count and the determination of Cage Cash pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.02_, will, in each case, be deemed to be modified to exclude such
Excluded Company (including, without limitation, its Cash, Indebtedness and
Net Working Capital) from such calculations, determination and adjustments.

(b)  _EBITDA Adjustment_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than February 28, 2018),
(A) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Seller to
prepare and deliver to Purchaser and Parent copies of Sellers management
account details containing the unaudited balance sheet of each Company and its
Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2017 and the related statement of income for
the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, prepared on a consistent
basis with the Company Financial Statements (the " _2017 Company Financial
Statements_ ") and (B) as promptly as practicable following receipt of the
2017 Company Financial Statements (but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days following Parents receipt of the 2017 Company Financial
Statements), Parent shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a written
statement (the " _2017 EBITDA Statement_ ") of 2017 EBITDA and 2017 Company
EBITDA for each Company, including reasonably detailed calculations of the
various amounts of the components of 2017 EBITDA and the 2017 Company EBITDA
of each Company. The 2017 EBITDA Statement shall be prepared in good faith in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and otherwise consistent with the

the 2017 Company Financial Statements with Purchaser and its Representatives;
_provided_ , that the accountants of Seller and its Affiliates shall not be
obliged to make any work papers available to Purchaser except in accordance
with such accountants normal disclosure procedures and then only after

in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants. From and
after the delivery of the 2017 EBITDA Statement until the
EBITDA Determination Date, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to (A) reasonably cooperate and assist Purchaser and its Representatives in
Purchasers review of the 2017 EBITDA Statement, (B) permit or use

reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

(iii) If Purchaser disagrees in whole or in part with the items used in or
the calculation of 2017 EBITDA or the items used in or any calculation of 2017
Company EBITDA, Purchaser shall, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of
the 2017 EBITDA Statement, notify Parent of such disagreement in writing ("
_EBITDA Dispute Notice_ "), setting forth in detail the particulars of such
disagreement. Any items or amounts on the 2017 EBITDA Statement not disputed
in writing by Purchaser within thirty (30) days after receipt of the 2017
EBITDA Statement shall be final, binding and conclusive for purposes of this
Agreement. If the EBITDA Dispute Notice is timely provided, Purchaser and
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of ten (10)
Business Days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to, in good
faith, attempt to resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation of
any amounts set forth in the EBITDA Dispute Notice. If the parties resolve
their differences over any disagreed item or amount, then the 2017 Company
EBITDA of each Company shall be the amounts agreed by them in writing. If, at
the end of such ten (10) Business Day period (or such longer period as the
parties may have mutually agreed), the parties are unable to fully resolve
the disagreements in respect of any disagreed items or amounts, the parties
shall mutually agree to refer the matter to KPMG LLP or PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP (such Person, the " _Auditor_ ") to resolve any remaining disagreements.
The Auditor shall be instructed to (i) consider only such matters as to which
there is a disagreement, (ii) determine, as promptly as practicable, whether
the disputed items or amounts set forth in the 2017 EBITDA Statement were
prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in this Agreement, and

6 (iv) The resolution for each disputed item or amount contained in
the Auditors determination shall be made subject to the definitions and
principles set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , with respect
to each disputed matter, such determination, if not in accordance with the
position of either Purchaser or Parent, shall not be in excess of the higher,
or less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Purchaser in the EBITDA
Dispute Notice or by Parent in the 2017 EBITDA Statement with respect to such
disputed matter. For the avoidance of doubt, the Auditor shall not review or
make any determination with respect to any matter other than the matters that
remain in dispute as indicated in an EBITDA Dispute Notice. Purchaser and
Parent shall bear their own expenses in the preparation and review of the
2017 EBITDA Statement (and Parent shall bear such costs of Seller), except
that the fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be borne equally by Parent and
Purchaser. During the review by the Auditor, each of Purchaser and Parent
shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates and its and their respective
employees, accountants and other Representatives to, each make available to
the Auditor interviews with such personnel, and such information, books and
records and work papers, as may be reasonably requested by the Auditor to
fulfill its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)(iv)_; _provided_ ,
that the accountants of Parent or Seller shall not be obliged to make any
work papers available to the Auditor except in accordance with such
accountants normal disclosure procedures and then only after such Auditor has
signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers. The
determination of the Auditor shall be final, binding and conclusive for
purposes of this Agreement and not subject to any further recourse by
Purchaser, Parent, Seller or their respective Affiliates, absent manifest
error or fraud by Purchaser, Parent, Seller or the Auditor. The date on which
all items and amounts set forth on the 2017 EBITDA Statement are finally
determined in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)(iv)_ is hereinafter
referred to as the " _EBITDA Determination Date._ "

(v) In the event the Auditor refuses engagement under this _Section_ __ _
2.01(b)_, Purchaser and Parent shall mutually agree on another nationally
recognized firm of certified public accountants (an " _Alternate Accounting
Firm_ ") having no material relationship with the Companies, Purchaser, Parent
or their respective Affiliates to resolve any disputes regarding the 2017
EBITDA Statement according to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)(iv)_. If within thirty
(30) days, Purchaser and Parent fail to mutually agree on an Alternate
Accounting Firm, then, within an additional ten (10) days, Purchaser and
Parent shall each select one such firm and those two firms shall, within ten
(10) Business Days after their selection, select a third (3rd) such firm who
will act as the Alternate Accounting Firm. The firm selected in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)(v)_ shall be the "Auditor" for the purposes
of this _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_.

 

(vi) The " _EBITDA Adjustment_ " shall be the amount (whether positive or
negative) equal to 6.25 _multiplied by _ 2017 EBITDA (as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_) _minus_ the Base Purchase Price.

 

(vii) The process set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of any of the parties and their respective Affiliates
for any disputes related to the 2017 EBITDA Statement, the 2017 Company EBITDA
of each Company and the calculations and amounts on which they are based or
set forth in the related statements 

 



7  and notices delivered in connection therewith, whether or not the underlying
facts and circumstances constitute a breach of any representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement.

 

Section 2.02 _Tax_ _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement to the
Payment Recipient such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
under the Code, or any provision of applicable Law with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and
paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Payment
Recipient.

 

Section 2.03 _Allocation_. Promptly after the Closing, but in any event within
seventy-five (75) days after the Closing, Purchaser shall provide Parent with
a schedule allocating the aggregate consideration paid pursuant to this
Agreement, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (and all other
items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes) among
the assets of the acquired Companies (" _Purchaser s Allocation_").
Purchasers Allocation shall be prepared in a manner consistent with Section
1060 of the Code (and, to the extent applicable, Section 338 of the Code) and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder. If Parent disagrees with Purchasers
Allocation, Parent may, within thirty (30) days of Parents receipt of
Purchasers Allocation, deliver to Boyd a notice in writing (" _Parent s
Allocation Notice_"), noting with specificity any allocations with which
Parent disagrees. If Parents Allocation Notice is delivered, Purchaser and
Parent shall negotiate in good faith for a period of fifteen (15) days to
resolve any disagreements with respect to the Purchasers Allocation. In the
event the parties cannot reach an agreement within such fifteen (15) day
period, the dispute shall be resolved by the Auditor in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_ and _(d)_ , applied _mutatis mutandis_ to the dispute
arising under this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_. The allocation, as prepared by
Purchaser if no Parents Allocation Notice has been given, as adjusted
pursuant to any agreement between Purchaser and Parent, or as determined by
the Auditor (the " _Allocation_ "), shall be conclusive and binding on the
parties. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Allocation shall be
amended to reflect any adjustments (including those described in _Section_ __
_ 3.03_) to the aggregate consideration made pursuant to this Agreement in a
manner consistent with the procedures set forth above. Boyd, Purchaser,
Seller, and Parent and their respective Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns
(including any IRS Form 8594) consistent with the Allocation, and shall take
no position contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith (including in any
audits or examinations by any Tax Authority or any other Proceeding), unless
otherwise required by applicable Law or unless the other parties consents
thereto in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent
Purchaser (or its Affiliates) or Seller or Parent (or their Affiliates) from
settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax Authority based
upon or arising out of the Allocation, and neither Purchaser (or its
Affiliates) nor Seller or Parent (or their Affiliates) shall be required to
litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax
Authority challenging such Allocation. Purchaser and Parent shall cooperate
(and Parent shall cause Seller to cooperate) in the filing of any forms
(including any IRS Form 8594 or IRS Form 8883, as applicable) with respect to
such Allocation, including any amendments to such forms required pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to any adjustment to the aggregate consideration
made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

apparent on the face of such disclosure, or in the disclosure letter delivered
by Boyd to Parent prior to the Effective Date (the " _Purchaser Disclosure
Letter_ ") (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered

impede, materially hinder or materially delay the consummation by Boyd or
Purchaser of the Transaction.

of any Liens other than Permitted Liens, in each case, upon any of
the properties or assets of Boyd or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such
losses, impairments, suspensions, limitations, conflicts, violations,

violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
other equivalent organizational document, in each case as amended or restated,

Company, Purchaser has not employed and no Person has acted directly or
indirectly as a broker, financial advisor or finder for Purchaser and
Purchaser has not incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions
or finders fees in connection with the Transaction.

 

Section 8.04 _Financing_. Purchaser and Boyd will have at the Closing funds
sufficient to enable Purchaser to pay the Closing Payment, any fees and
expenses payable under this Agreement by Purchaser and to consummate the
Transaction. In no event shall the receipt or availability of funds or

obligations hereunder. As of the date hereof, the sum of (a) the unrestricted
cash of Purchaser, (b) the unrestricted cash of Boyd and (c) undrawn revolving
loan commitments immediately available for borrowings by Boyd ("
_Available Commitments_ ") pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Credit

dated as of September 15, 2016 and Amendment No. 2 and Refinancing
Amendment dated as of March 29, 2017 (as so amended, the " _Boyd Credit
Agreement_ "), among Boyd, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and
the other parties thereto (the sum of (a), (b) and (c),

 



36  the " _Available Sources_ ") equal an amount not less than the sum of (x)
the aggregate cash consideration payable to Seller hereunder and (y) the
aggregate amount of any fees and expenses or other amounts payable by Boyd
and Purchaser in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (such
sum of (x) and (y), the " _Required Amount_ ").

 

Section 8.05 _Solvency_. As of the Closing, after giving effect to any
Indebtedness being incurred on such date in connection herewith, and assuming
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.02_, neither
Boyd nor the Purchaser (i) will be insolvent (either because its financial
condition is such that the sum of its debts (including a reasonable estimate
of the amount of all contingent Liabilities) is greater than the fair value of
its assets, or because the present fair salable value of its assets will be
less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its debts as
they become absolute and matured), (ii) have unreasonably small capital with
which to engage in its business or (iii) have incurred or plan to incur debts
beyond its ability to pay as they become absolute and matured.

 

Section 8.06 _Purchaser_. Purchaser is a wholly owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary of Boyd. Since its date of incorporation, Purchaser has not
carried on any business nor conducted any operations other than the execution
of this Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and matters
ancillary thereto.

 

Section 8.07 _Licensability of Principals_. None of Boyd or any of its
respective officers, directors, partners, managers, members, principals or
Affiliates which may reasonably be considered in the process of determining
the suitability of Boyd for a Gaming Approval by a Gaming Authority, or any
holders of Bobcats capital stock or other equity interests who will
be required to be licensed or found suitable under applicable Gaming Laws
(the foregoing persons collectively, the " _Purchaser_ _Licensed Affiliates_
"), has ever abandoned or withdrawn (in each case in response to a
communication from a Gaming Authority regarding a likely or impending denial,
suspension or revocation) or been denied or had suspended or revoked a Gaming
Approval, or an application for a Gaming Approval, by a Gaming Authority. Each
of Boyd and its Licensing Affiliates which is licensed or holds any Gaming
Approval pursuant to applicable Gaming Laws (collectively, the " _Purchaser
Affiliate Permits_ ") is in good standing in each of the jurisdictions in
which such Purchaser Licensed Affiliate owns, operates, or manages gaming
facilities. To the knowledge of Boyd, there are no facts which, if known to
any Gaming Authority, would be reasonably likely to (i) result in the denial,
revocation, limitation or suspension of a Purchaser Affiliate Permit of any
of the Purchaser Licensed Affiliate or (ii) result in a negative outcome to
any finding of suitability proceedings of any of the Purchaser Licensed
Affiliate currently pending, or under the licensing, suitability,
registration or approval proceedings necessary for the consummation of the
Transaction.

Section 8.08 _Litigation_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially impede, materially
hinder or materially delay the consummation by Boyd or Purchaser of the
Transaction, (a) there are no actions, suits, inquiries, investigations,
proceedings, subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other requests for
information relating to potential violations of Law pending (or, to the
knowledge of Purchaser, threatened) against or affecting Boyd or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties and (b) there are no
Orders of, or before, any Governmental Entity against Boyd or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



37 Section 8.09 _No Additional Representations_.

 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties contained in this _Article
VIII_ , neither Boyd nor Purchaser nor any other Person or entity on behalf
of Boyd or Purchaser has made or makes any representation or warranty, whether
express or implied, with respect to Boyd, its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses, affairs, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results
of operations, future operating or financial results, estimates, projections,

results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of any of Boyd or its
Subsidiaries, whether or not included in any management presentation.

 

(b) Boyd and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that except, (i) with respect to
Seller, for the representations and warranties contained in  _Article VI_ and
_Article VII_ and (ii) with respect to Parent, for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article V_ , none of the Companies, Seller, Parent or
any other Person or entity on behalf of Seller or Parent has made or makes

Representatives by or on behalf of Parent, Seller or the Companies. In
furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, Boyd and Purchaser
acknowledge and agree that none of Parent, Seller, the Companies or any other
Person or entity on behalf of Parent, Seller or the Companies has made or
makes, and neither Boyd nor Purchaser has relied upon, any representation or
warranty, whether express or implied, with respect to any projections,
forecasts, estimates, budgets, future operating or financial results, plans or
prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets, future operating or financial
results, plans or prospects) provided or made available to Boyd or Purchaser
or any of their respective Representatives, or of future revenues, future
results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of any of Parent, Seller, the
Companies or the Business, whether or not included in any management
presentation. Boyd and the Purchaser acknowledge and agree that none of

makes any representation or warranty, whether express or implied, with respect
to the Retained Liabilities.

of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and any material
developments in respect thereto. Parent shall promptly notify Purchaser in
writing upon the occurrence of any event, fact or circumstance that to the

be complied with or satisfied by it under the Merger Agreement such that it
would be reasonable to expect that (A) the applicable closing conditions of

(B) such failure to comply with or satisfy such covenant or agreement would be
materially adverse to the Transaction, the Business or any of the Companies,
the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities; (iii) resulted in the
failure of any condition necessary to consummate the Merger capable of being

Agreement pursuant to such Compensated Termination Provision.

(f) Seller shall cause Seller Subsidiary, and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause Seller to cause Seller Subsidiary, to perform and
observe all of its covenants and agreements contained in the Existing Master

required to be maintained by Seller Subsidiary thereunder. Seller shall not
cause or permit, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
Seller not to cause or permit, Seller Subsidiary to take any action under the
Existing Master Lease related to the Casinos without Purchasers prior
written consent (other than any actions taken in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practice).

Section 9.02 _Employee Matters_.

(a) _Transfer of Employees_. Subject to any rights any Property Employee has
under his or her employment agreement, prior to the Closing, Seller or its

effective as of the day immediately prior to the Closing, (a) each Property
Employee is employed by the applicable Company or its Subsidiary, and (b) the
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries do not employ any individual who
is not a Property Employee. Without the prior written consent of Seller (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Purchaser shall not
communicate any terms of employment to Property Employees prior to the Closing
or otherwise communicate directly with any Property Employees.

 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of Employment_. From the Closing Date until the
later of December 31, 2019 and the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall provide (or cause the Companies or their
Subsidiaries to provide) each Property Employee whose employment with a
Company continues on and following the Closing Date (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") with (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate, as
applicable, cash incentive compensation opportunities and target annual equity
incentive compensation opportunities that are, in each case, no less favorable
than those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and (ii) other compensation and employee and fringe benefits
(including health, welfare and retirement benefits, but excluding severance
benefits, which are described in the immediately following sentence) that are
no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that, if the
Closing Date occurs prior to the commencement of Purchasers and Sellers
annual benefit plan enrollment periods, Purchaser may instead provide
Continuing Employees with health and welfare benefits that it provides to its
similarly situated employees. Any Continuing Employee who incurs a qualifying
termination of employment during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the later of December 31, 2019 and the first anniversary of the
Closing Date shall be entitled to receive the severance payments and
benefits from Purchaser or its Subsidiaries as outlined in, and under the
terms of, Sellers Change of Control Severance Plan or severance benefits
contained in such Continuing Employees employment agreement, as applicable.
Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a schedule of

 



40  compensation and employee and fringe benefits contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 9.02(b)_ for each Property Employee no later than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date.

participation and benefit accrual under the employee benefit and compensation
arrangements maintained by Purchaser and/or its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the Companies or their Subsidiaries) providing benefits
to Continuing Employees on and after the Closing Date (collectively, "
_Purchaser Benefit Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with
his or her years of service with Seller, the Companies and their respective
Affiliates (and any predecessor entities thereto) before the Closing Date, to
the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing
Date, to credit for such service under any similar Employee Benefit Plans;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply (i) to the extent
its application would result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) with respect
to benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan or retiree welfare
benefit plan, or (iii) with respect to any Purchaser Benefits Plan for which
prior service is not taken into account for similarly situated employees of
Purchaser.

(d) _Health Coverage_. Purchaser shall cause each Continuing Employee and his
or her eligible dependents to be covered, effective at the Closing, by a group
health plan or plans maintained by Purchaser and its Affiliates that (i)
comply with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.02(b)_, (ii) do not limit or
exclude coverage on the basis of any preexisting condition of such Continuing
Employee or dependent (other than any limitation already in effect under the
applicable group health Employee Benefit Plan) or on the basis of any other
exclusion or waiting period not in effect under the applicable group health
Employee Benefit Plan, and (iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
provide each Continuing Employee credit under Purchaser or its
applicable Affiliates group health plans as if the following amounts had
been paid thereunder, for the year in which the Closing Date occurs, for any
deductible or co-payment already incurred by the applicable Continuing
Employee under the applicable group health Employee Benefit Plan and for any
other out-of-pocket expenses that count against any maximum out-of-pocket
expense provision of the applicable group health Employee Benefit Plan or
Purchaser or its applicable Affiliates group health plans.

 

(e) _Accrued Vacation, Sick Leave and Paid Time-Off_. Effective as of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall recognize all Liabilities with respect to
accrued but unused vacation time for all Property Employees (including any
Liabilities to Property Employees for payments in respect of earned but unused
vacation time that arise as a result of the transfer of employment
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)_). Purchaser shall promptly (and, in
any event, within ten (10) Business Days following the later of the Closing
Date and the date of the applicable payment) reimburse Seller for any
payments made by Seller or its Affiliates to any Property Employee in respect
of earned but unused vacation time that become due as a result of the transfer
of employment contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)_. Purchaser shall
allow Continuing Employees to use the vacation, sick leave and personal time
assumed and recognized pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.02(e)_ in accordance
with the terms of Purchasers and its applicable Affiliates programs in
effect from time to time (in addition to, and not in lieu of, any vacation
accrued under the applicable vacation plans or policies of Purchaser or its
Affiliates on or following the Closing).

 



41 (f) _401(k) Plan_. Effective at the Closing, Purchaser shall establish
participation by the Continuing Employees in Purchasers tax-qualified
defined contribution plan or plans with a cash or deferred feature (the "
_Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ ") for the benefit of each Continuing Employee who,
as of immediately prior to the Closing, was eligible to participate in a tax-
qualified defined contribution plan maintained by Seller or its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Seller 401(k) Plans_ "). As soon as practicable after
the Closing Date, the Seller 401(k) Plans shall, to the extent permitted by
Section 401(k)(10) of the Code, make distributions available to Continuing
Employees, and the Purchaser 401(k) Plan shall accept any such distribution,
including notes, in the case of loans, as a rollover contribution if such
rollover is so directed in accordance with applicable law by the applicable
Continuing Employee. Seller shall remain responsible for making all required
employer contributions to the accounts of Continuing Employees under the
Seller 401(k) Plan with respect to all periods prior to the Closing.

 

(g) _Bonuses_. On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall pay a pro rata portion
of any annual and short-term incentive awards due to Continuing Employees as
provided in Section 5.16(c) of the Merger Agreement. Effective as of the
Closing, Purchaser shall assume the Liability for the post-Closing portion of
any annual or short-term incentive awards due to Continuing Employees for the
fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, which Liability shall be calculated
on the same basis used to determine the pre-Closing amounts paid by Seller.
Without limiting the generality of  _Section_ __ _ 9.02(b)_, following the
Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Continuing Employees to participate in
annual or short-term incentive plans of Purchaser and its Affiliates for the
remainder of any applicable performance period that is incomplete as of the
Closing Date, which plans shall provide for cash incentive compensation
opportunities, performance standards and continuation of employment
requirements that are no less favorable than those contained in the annual or
short-term incentive plans of Seller with respect to performance periods that
are incomplete as of the Closing Date, such that if the Continuing Employees
were to continue to participate in Sellers annual or short term
incentive plans applicable to them, such Continuing Employees would have
received no less favorable payments. Following the end of the applicable
performance period, Purchaser shall pay each such Continuing Employee a bonus
in respect of the portion of such performance period following the Closing
that is no less than the accrual for such Continuing Employee assumed by
Purchaser pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(h) _Company Benefit Plans_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
assume all Company Benefit Plans, and become solely responsible for all
Liabilities thereunder. On and following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their respective terms.

 

(i) _Assumed Employee Liabilities_. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.02(k)_, effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall assume all Liabilities
in respect of (i) any Property Employees and (ii) any former employees of
Seller or its Affiliates who primarily provided services to the Business, in
each case, regardless of whether such Liabilities relate to, arise out of or
result from, such individuals employment prior to, on or after the Closing,
but only to the extent arising out of or related to such individuals
employment with the Business (collectively, " _Assumed Employee Liabilities_
").

 



42 (j) _Employee Termination Rights_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.02(i)_, from
and after the Closing, Purchaser or any of the Companies may terminate the
employment of any Property Employee in accordance with its customary
employment practices, including following unsatisfactory results of any
background check, which Purchaser may undertake in its discretion.

(k) _Allocation of Welfare Benefit Claims_. Seller shall retain the Liability
and responsibility with respect to claims incurred by Continuing Employees
(and their dependents and beneficiaries) prior to the Closing under the
Employee Benefit Plans (other than any Company Benefit Plans) that provide
medical, dental, vision, employee assistance program and prescription drug
coverage, life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel
accident insurance and disability coverage. Purchaser shall retain (and
assume, if necessary) Liability and responsibility for claims incurred by
Continuing Employees (and their dependents and beneficiaries) on or following
the Closing under any Purchaser employee benefit plans that provide medical,
dental, vision, employee assistance program and prescription drug
coverage, life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel
accident insurance and disability coverage. For purposes of this _Section_ __
_ 9.02(k)_, a benefit claim shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (i)
health, dental, vision, employee assistance program and prescription drug
benefits (including in respect of any hospital confinement), upon provision of
such services, materials or supplies; and (ii) life, accidental death and
dismemberment and business travel accident insurance and disability benefits,
upon the death, cessation of employment or other event giving rise to such
benefits.

 

(l) _Certain Seller Employees_. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser will, or
will cause one of its Subsidiaries to, make written employment offers to any
Property Employees who are not employed by a Company or its Subsidiaries after
giving effect to Sellers actions described in _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)_ as
identified by Seller no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date (the " _Identified Employees_ "). Such offers will contain terms
of at-will employment with respect to (i) a base salary or hourly wage
rate, as applicable, cash incentive compensation opportunities and target
annual equity incentive compensation opportunities that are, in each case, no
less favorable than those provided to such Identified Employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date, (ii) other compensation and employee and fringe
benefits (including health, welfare and retirement benefits, but excluding
severance benefits) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those
provided to such Identified Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date,
(iii) severance entitlements that are no less favorable than what is provided
in the Sellers Change of Control Severance Plan or contained in such
Identified Employees employment agreement, as applicable, and (iv) other
material terms of employment that are, in each case, no less favorable than
those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Parent and Seller shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to help facilitate such Identified Employees to become employees of
Purchaser pursuant to the terms of the employment offers as of the Closing
(but, in each case, shall not be required to pay any additional consideration
to Identified Employees). Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 9.02(i)_, if any
Identified Employee does not for any reason accept employment with Purchaser
or its Affiliates at or after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, reimburse and otherwise indemnify and hold harmless Seller
and its Affiliates for any severance payments or benefits payable to such
Identified Employee, and all such payments and benefits shall constitute
Assumed Employee Liabilities.

 



43 (m) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this Agreement shall
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Property Employee, any
Continuing Employee or any beneficiary or eligible family member thereof, with
respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or
benefits that may be provided to any Property Employee by Purchaser or under
any benefit plan which Purchaser may maintain. In no event shall the terms of
this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Employee
Benefit Plan, any Purchaser Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, Seller, Purchaser,
the Companies or any Subsidiary of a Company or any of their respective
Affiliates; or (ii) confer upon any Property Employee or any Continuing
Employee any right to employment or continued employment or continued service
with Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing
Date, the Companies or any Subsidiary of a Company), or constitute or create
an employment or other agreement with any Property Employee or any Continuing
Employee. No provision of this Agreement will be deemed to change the "at
will" status of any Continuing Employee.

 

Section 9.03 _Access to Information and Inspection_. For purposes of
facilitating the Transaction, at Parents reasonable request, Seller shall
afford (a) the officers and employees and (b) the accountants, consultants,
legal counsel, financial advisors, financing sources and agents and other
Representatives of Purchaser such reasonable access during normal business
hours, throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Closing Date and
termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, to Sellers and the Companies
personnel and properties, contracts, commitments, books and records and any
report, schedule or other document filed or received by it pursuant to the
requirements of applicable Laws and with such additional accounting,
operating, environmental and other data and information regarding the
Companies, to the extent in the possession of the Companies or their
Subsidiaries, as Boyd or Purchaser may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not be required to provide access to or make available
to any person any document or information that, in the reasonable judgment of
Seller, (i) violates any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality,
(ii) is subject to any attorney-client, work-product or other legal privilege,
or (iii) the disclosure of which would violate any Law or legal duty (
_provided_ that Seller will use reasonable efforts to allow such access or
disclosure in a manner that does not result in loss or waiver of such
privilege, including, but not limited to, entering into appropriate common
interest or similar agreements); _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein
shall authorize Boyd, Purchaser or their Representatives to undertake any
environmental testing or sampling at any of the properties owned, operated or
leased by Seller or its Subsidiaries. Each of Boyd and Purchaser agrees that
it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any information
obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ for any competitive or other
purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transaction. Each of Boyd and
Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any
disruption to the businesses of Seller that may result from requests for
access. Prior to the delivery of the Joinder, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts, including enforcing Sellers obligations under the Merger
Agreement to the extent necessary, to cause Seller to comply with its
obligations in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.03_.

Section 9.04 _Governmental Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
shall cooperate with the other parties and use their respective reasonable
best efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do,
or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper

 



44  or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _
10.01_ to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, including preparing and
filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents under applicable Antitrust Laws and (ii)
obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and
other confirmations from any Governmental Entity necessary under the FTC Order
and required under applicable Antitrust Laws to consummate the Transaction (an
" _Antitrust Approval_ ").

 

(b) Purchaser understands that Purchaser, and this Agreement, are subject to
the prior approval of the FTC and any other Governmental Authority and that
Parent and Seller are entering into this Agreement to obtain FTC approval for
the FTC Order and to satisfy the requirements of any other Governmental
Entitys conditional approval in connection with the Merger pursuant to the
Merger Agreement. Purchaser, as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, will (i) prepare and furnish all necessary information and documents
reasonably requested by the FTC or any other Governmental Entity, (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to demonstrate to the FTC or any other Governmental
Entity that Purchaser is an acceptable purchaser of the Purchased Assets and
that Purchaser will be able to compete effectively using the Purchased Assets
along with its own assets, and (iii) reasonably cooperate with Parent and
Seller in obtaining all FTC approvals and any other Antitrust Approval or
Gaming Approval. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Parent and Seller
from complying with the FTC Order, and Parent and Seller shall not be
considered in breach of this Agreement for taking actions required to be taken
to comply with the FTC Order. Parent shall control all strategy and
communications with the FTC and any other Governmental Entities, and
accordingly, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Laws, the FTC or any
other Governmental Entities, Purchaser shall not communicate with or make
submissions to the FTC or any other Governmental Entities without the
simultaneous attendance or prior written consent of Seller, provided however
that Parent and Purchaser shall jointly control strategy and communications
with the FTC and any other Governmental Entities regarding any review process
of the FTC or any other Governmental Entity to determine whether Purchaser is
an acceptable purchaser of the Purchased Assets and whether Purchaser will be
able to compete effectively using the Purchased Assets, and provided further,
that Purchaser shall control the substance of communications insofar as they
relate specifically to Purchaser. Parent and Seller shall not, without prior
consultation with and approval of Purchaser, have any communication with the
FTC or other Governmental Entity, or make any submission to the FTC or any
other Governmental Entity, regarding whether Purchaser is an acceptable
purchaser of the Purchased Assets or whether Purchaser will be able to compete
effectively using the Purchased Assets. Each of the parties shall promptly
notify the other parties of any communication it receives from any
Governmental Entity relating to the transactions that are the subject of this
Agreement and permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed
communication by or on its behalf or any of its Affiliates to any
Governmental Entity, unless the staff of such Governmental Entity requires
otherwise.

(c) Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Entity in connection with the Transaction under
Antitrust Laws or Gaming Laws and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Entity relating to Antitrust Laws or
Gaming Laws and (ii) keep the other parties informed in all material respects
and on a reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by
such party from, or given by

 



45  such party to, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity. Subject to
applicable Law relating to the exchange of information and any applicable
joint defense agreement, each of the parties shall have the right to review
in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all
the information relating to the other parties and their respective Affiliates,
as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transaction related to Antitrust Laws or Gaming Laws; _provided_ , that Parent
and Seller shall not be entitled to review or have access to Purchasers
business plan or Purchasers other competitively sensitive information.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 9.04_,
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall be able to consult with the FTC or
any other Governmental Entities pursuant to applicable Law or otherwise if
the staff of such Governmental Entity requests direct communication with or
submissions from Purchaser or any of its Affiliates without prior written
consent of, notification to or attendance of Parent or Seller.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of Purchaser
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.04_, each of the parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by a Governmental Entity with respect to Antitrust Laws or Gaming Laws in any
jurisdiction in which approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations are required under applicable Antitrust
Laws or Gaming Laws to consummate the Transaction. Without limiting any other
provision hereof, but subject to  _Section_ __ _ 9.04(e)_, each of the
parties shall take any and all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transaction so as to enable the
consummation of the Transaction to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and
in any event no later than the End Date).

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, no
party, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall have any obligation or
affirmative duty to sell, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any of
its assets or properties, agree to do any of the foregoing in the future, or
take any such actions in connection with seeking any Antitrust Approval,
any Gaming Approval or other approval of any Governmental Entity.

(f) In no event shall Purchaser agree to, propose to or acquire any
business or assets (regardless of value) which would reasonably be expected
to (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk
of not obtaining, any Antitrust Approval or Gaming Approval, or (ii) prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent and Seller to
consummate the Merger.

Section 9.05 _Notification of Certain Events_. Each of Parent, Seller and
Purchaser shall promptly notify the other parties in writing upon obtaining
knowledge of the occurrence of any event that has caused: (a) any
representation or warranty of the notifying party contained in this Agreement
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect as of the time made under
this Agreement; or (b) any material failure of the notifying party to comply
with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it under this Agreement, in each case, if such failure to be true or accurate
or failure to comply has caused or would reasonably be expected to cause any
condition to the obligations of the notified party to effect the Transaction
not to be satisfied;  _provided_ that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing with respect to any change or event shall not be
deemed to constitute a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 9.05_, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such
notice, in

 



46  each case unless the underlying change or event would independently (or
together with other facts or events known to such party at the time of the
underlying change or event) result in a failure of the conditions set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 10.01_, _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.03_ to
be satisfied.

 

Section 9.06 _Publicity_. Parent and Purchaser shall agree on the form and
content of the initial press release regarding the Transaction and thereafter
shall consult with each other before issuing, provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, and negotiate in good faith to agree
upon, any press release or other public statement with respect to
the Transaction and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation and prior to considering in good
faith any such comments, except as may be required by applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser and Parent may
make any public statement in response to questions by the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analysts
conference calls or in connection with a financing, so long as any such
statements are consistent with, and do not contain information not disclosed
in, previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made
jointly by Purchaser and Parent or made by one party and reviewed by the
other, and do not otherwise reveal non-public information regarding the
Merger, the Transaction, the Ancillary Agreements or any of the other parties.

 

Section 9.07 _Tax_ _Matters_.

 

(a) All transfer, recording, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other such Taxes (including real estate transfer or similar Taxes that arise
from any indirect transfer of property as a result of the transfer of the
Membership Interests), related fees (including any penalties, interest and
additions to Tax) incurred with respect to the purchase and sale of the
Membership Interests pursuant to this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") and
any fees for applications, consents, approvals, Permits, registrations or
filings made or sought pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by Parent. Either Purchaser, on
the one hand, or Parent or Seller, on the other hand, as obligated by
applicable Law, shall prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes and pay in full all such
Transfer Taxes, and the non-filing party shall promptly reimburse the filing
party for its share of such Transfer Taxes. Parent and Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate (and Parent shall cause Seller to reasonably cooperate)
in preparing and filing all Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, including
joining in the execution of such Tax Returns to the extent required by
applicable Law.

 

(b) Purchaser, Seller and Parent agree to furnish (or cause to be furnished)
to the other, upon reasonable request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to Taxes, including access to books and
records, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns by
Purchaser, Seller, the Companies, their Subsidiaries, or Parent, the
preparation for any audit by any Tax Authority and the prosecution or defense
of any claim, suit or Proceeding relating to Taxes. Purchaser and Parent shall
retain (and Parent shall cause Seller to retain) all books and records with
respect to Taxes of the Companies or their Subsidiaries for a period of at
least seven (7) years following the Closing Date. The parties agree to hold
all materials and documents delivered pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
9.07(b)_, and all confidential information contained therein, confidential
pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, neither Parent nor Seller shall be required to

 



47  provide Purchaser with a copy of, or otherwise disclose the contents of, any
consolidated Tax Return, except to the extent Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Companies and their Subsidiaries following the
Closing) receives any notice of inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar
proceeding relating to any liability for Taxes of another Person under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law) or as a transferee or successor of such other Person and
such consolidated Tax Returns (or contents thereof) contain
information directly relevant to such notice of inquiry, claim, assessment,
audit or similar proceeding or are otherwise necessary for Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates (including the Companies and their Subsidiaries following the
Closing) to conduct such proceeding.

(c) Purchaser and Parent agree, for U.S. federal income tax purposes and all
other applicable income and franchise tax purposes, to treat (and Parent
shall cause Seller to treat) the purchase and sale of all of the Membership
Interests of Belterra and Belterra Park as a purchase of the assets of
Belterra and Belterra Park, respectively, and Purchaser and Parent shall not
take (and Parent shall not cause or permit Seller to take) any actions
inconsistent with such treatment, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law.

 

(d) Parent and such of its Subsidiaries as are necessary, on the one hand, and
Purchaser and such of its Subsidiaries as are necessary, on the other hand,
shall jointly make an irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code (and any corresponding elections under state or local Tax Law)
(collectively, the " _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Elections_") with respect to
the sale and purchase of the Membership Interests of Ameristar Kansas City and
Ameristar St. Charles under this Agreement. Purchaser, Parent, and Seller
shall cooperate in the preparation of all forms, attachments, schedules,
and documents required to effect valid and timely Section 338(h)(10)
Elections in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section
1.338(h)(10)-1 (or any corresponding provisions of state or local Tax Law),
including IRS Forms 8023 and 8883 (and any corresponding state or local Tax
forms), in each case, in a manner that incorporates, reflects, and is
consistent with the Allocation and _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ (collectively, the "
_Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Forms_"). Purchaser, Parent, and Seller shall (or
shall cause their relevant Affiliates to) timely file such Section 338(h)(10)
Forms with the applicable Taxing Authority. In furtherance of the foregoing,
with respect to each Section 338(h)(10) Election, prior to the Closing,
Purchaser, Parent, and Seller shall agree, based on information then
available, on the form and content of, and at Closing, Parent and Seller
shall deliver to Purchaser a duly executed, IRS Form 8023 that reflects such
Section 338(h)(10) Election (and any analogous forms required to effectuate
such Section 338(h)(10) Election for state or local Tax purposes). To the
extent permissible by or required by law, Purchaser, Parent, Seller, and their
respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate in the preparation and timely filing
of any corrections, amendments, or supplements to any Section 338(h)(10)
Form; provided, however, that all such forms and reports shall be prepared in
a manner that incorporates, reflects, and is consistent with the Allocation
and _Section_ __ _ 2.03_. Subject to the preceding sentence, none of
Purchaser, Parent, or Seller shall, or shall permit their respective
Subsidiaries to, modify any of the Section 338(h)(10) Forms (including any
corrections, amendments, and supplements thereto) after the execution of such
Section 338(h)(10) Forms or to modify or revoke any Section 338(h)(10)
Election following the filing of the relevant IRS Form 8023 by Purchaser, in
each case, without the written consent of Parent or Purchaser, as the case may
be, except as may be required pursuant to a "determination" (as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law); provided, however, that IRS Form 8883 may be

 



48  filed without the consent of the other party so long as such form is filed
in a manner that incorporates, reflects, and is consistent with the Allocation
and  _Section_ __ _ 2.03_. Purchaser, Parent, Seller, and their respective
Affiliates shall cooperate fully with each other and make available to each
other such Tax data or other information as may be reasonably required by the
parties in order to timely file any Section 338(h)(10) Elections, including
to the extent necessary for the valid filing of any corrections, amendments,
or supplements to any Section 338(h)(10)Form. Purchaser, Parent, and Seller
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, (x) treat each Section
338(h)(10) Election as valid, and (y) take no position on any Tax Return or
any Tax proceeding that is inconsistent with the validity of the Section
338(h)(10) Elections, unless, in each case, to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law).

 

(e) Any and all Tax sharing, allocation, indemnification or similar agreements
binding any Company or any Subsidiary of any Company shall be terminated as
to such Company or Subsidiary, as applicable, as of the Closing Date and, from
and after the Closing Date, no Company and no Subsidiary of any Company shall
be obligated to make any payment to any Person pursuant thereto.

 

(f) If a party or any of its Affiliates (the " _Preparing Party_ ") is
preparing for filing after Closing a Tax Return that could give rise to a Tax
payment obligation on the part of the other party or any of its Affiliates
(the " _Reviewing Party_ "), the Preparing Party shall deliver to the
Reviewing Party a draft of such Tax Return at least thirty (30) days prior to
filing thereof (or, if required to be filed within thirty (30) days after the
Closing Date or the end of the relevant taxable period, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing or end of such taxable period) and shall
permit the Reviewing Party to review and comment on such Tax Return. If the
Tax Return relates solely or primarily to Taxes for which the Reviewing Party
is liable, the Preparing Party shall make such revisions to such Tax Return as
are reasonably requested by the Reviewing Party in writing within twenty (20)
days of the Reviewing Partys receipt of the Tax Return, to the extent not
inconsistent with applicable Law. In the case of other Tax Returns, the
Preparing Party shall consider in good faith any revisions to such Tax Return
as are reasonably requested by the Reviewing Party in writing within twenty
(20) days of the Reviewing Partys receipt of the Tax Return.

 

(g) Following the Closing, Purchaser, on the one hand, and Parent and Seller,
on the other hand, shall promptly notify each other upon receipt of notice of
any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to
Taxes for which such other party may be liable hereunder (any such inquiry,
claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a " _Tax Contest_ "). Any failure
to so notify the other party of any Tax Contest shall not relieve such other
party of any liability with respect to such Tax Contest except to the extent
such party was actually and materially prejudiced as a result thereof.

 

(h) Each party shall have the right to control (at that partys own expense)
the conduct and resolution of any Tax Contest that relates solely to Taxes
for which that party is liable pursuant to this Agreement, _provided_ , that
(i) the controlling party shall keep the other party informed regarding the
progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Contest, including providing the
other party with all substantive written materials relating to such Tax
Contest received from the relevant Tax Authority and all substantive written
materials submitted to such

 



49  Tax Authority by the controlling party, (ii) the non-controlling party shall
have the right to participate in such Tax Contest (at its own expense), and
(iii) the controlling party shall not resolve such Tax Contest in a manner
that would have an adverse impact on the non-controlling party without
the non-controlling partys prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If a party shall have the right to control
the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest but elects in writing not to
do so, then the other party shall have the right to control the conduct and
resolution of such Tax Contest, but shall keep the non-controlling party
informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Contest
(including providing copies of all substantive written materials relating to
such Tax Contest received from the relevant Tax Authority and all substantive
written materials submitted to such Tax Authority), and shall not resolve
such Tax Contest without the non-controlling partys written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(i) In the event of any Tax Contest not governed by _Section_ __ _ 9.07(h)_,
the party receiving notice of the Tax Contest will, as to any Taxes in
respect of which the other party or any of its Affiliates may be liable,
promptly inform the other party of, and permit the participation of the other
party in, the Tax Contest and will not consent to the settlement or
final determination in such proceeding without the prior written consent of
the other party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(j) In the event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 12.04_ and this  _Section_ __ _ 9.07_, the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 9.07_ shall control.

(k) No party shall amend, or permit their Affiliates to amend, any Tax Return
that could give rise to a Tax payment obligation on the part of the other
party or any of its Affiliates without the prior written consent of such other
party.

 

(l) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement potentially to the
contrary, in no event shall Boyd or any of its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Companies and any of their Subsidiaries) have any
responsibility to pay directly, or to reimburse or indemnify the Parent or any
of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Seller and its
Subsidiaries) for, any federal consolidated or state income Taxes payable by
Seller or any Subsidiary owned by Seller immediately prior to the Closing in
respect of taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending subsequent to the date
of this Agreement and on or prior to the Closing Date.

Section 9.08 _Confidentiality_. The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect until the Closing and shall terminate automatically at
the Closing, except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.09_. For a period of
thirty-six (36) months after the Closing, each party shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, hold in confidence any and all Proprietary
Information, and not use in any manner whatsoever any Proprietary Information
(other than as required by Law or permitted by this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement) whether written or oral, related to the other party, its
Subsidiaries (including in the case of Boyd, the Companies), its assets and
businesses (such information collectively, the " _Confidential Information_
"), except to the extent that such Person can show that such Proprietary
Information (a) is independently developed by such Person or its
Representatives after the Closing Date without the benefit of any Confidential
Information or in breach of this Agreement, (b) is or becomes generally
available to the public, other than as a result of disclosure by such Person
or its Representatives in breach of this

 



50  Agreement, (c) is reasonably relevant for enforcing such partys rights or
defending against assertions by another party and is only disclosed to any
Governmental Entity or an arbitrator in connection with any Proceeding
involving (i) a dispute between Purchaser and Parent or their respective
Affiliates arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
(ii) the interpretation, entry into, performance, breach or termination of
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, (d) is disclosed with the prior
written consent of the other party, (e) is requested or required to be
disclosed by applicable Law or regulatory, judicial or administrative
process, (f) the extent used by a party or any of its Affiliates in order to
comply with the terms of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or
any other Contract between Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand or (g) that becomes
available on a non-confidential basis to a party or any of its Affiliates from
and after the Closing from a third party source that is not known by such
party or its applicable Affiliates, after reasonable inquiry, to be under any
obligations of confidentiality with respect to such information. If a party or
any of its Affiliates is compelled to disclose any such information by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law or Order,
such Person shall promptly notify the other party in writing and shall
disclose only that portion of such information which such Person is advised by
its counsel is legally required to be disclosed; _provided_ that such Person
shall exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective
order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded such information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the
Closing, neither Purchaser nor Boyd shall have any obligation to maintain the
confidentiality of or to refrain from using in any manner any Proprietary
Information, whether written or oral, related to the Companies, the Purchased
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business.

Section 9.09 _No Solicitation of Employees_. From and after the Closing Date
until the twelve-month (12) anniversary of the Closing Date, neither Parent
nor Boyd nor any Person acting on such partys behalf, shall, directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment or employ any employees of the other party
or any of such partys Subsidiaries at the level of Director or higher;
_provided_ that neither Parent nor Boyd shall be restricted from (a) making
any general solicitation for employment by use of advertisements in the media
or through recruitment firms that is not specifically directed at employees of
the other party or its Subsidiaries and (b) hiring such employee who responds
to any such permitted general solicitation or who first contacts the other
party or its Representatives regarding employment without any solicitation in
violation of this _Section_ __ _ 9.09_ or who has separated from such party
or its Subsidiaries for at least two (2) months prior to such solicitation.

Section 9.10 _Parent Release_. Effective as of the Closing, each of Parent and
Seller, for itself and for its predecessors, successors, assigns executors,
trustees, beneficiaries, officers, directors, Affiliates, Subsidiaries,
agents, administrators and any other Person claiming through Seller (the "
_Releasing Parties_ "), hereby generally, irrevocably, unconditionally and
completely releases and forever discharges each of the Companies, their
Subsidiaries, and each of their Affiliates, successors assigns, directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys and representatives (the " _Releasees_
") from, and hereby irrevocably, unconditionally and completely waives and
relinquishes, each of the Released Claims. "Released Claims" shall mean and
include any and all past, present and future disputes, claims, controversies,
demands, rights, obligations, liabilities, actions and causes of action of
every kind and nature arising out of or related to events, circumstances or
actions or inactions with respect to the Companies or the

 



51  Companies affairs on or before the Closing Date, including any unknown,
unsuspected or undisclosed claim; _provided, further_ , that __ this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.10(i)_ shall not constitute a release from, waiver of, or
otherwise apply to the terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or
any liability (including any obligations of Purchaser and its Affiliates
in respect of Assumed Liabilities) or other agreement expressly contemplated
by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to be in effect after the
Closing, or any enforcement thereof, (ii) shall in no way impair, Parents or
its Affiliates rights or remedies under this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement or other agreement contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement and (iii) shall not impair any claim against any Releasees that
arises as a result of, or is related to, Sellers and its directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys and representatives in such Persons
capacity as an officer, director or employee of any of the Companies.

 

Section 9.11 _Excluded Company Actions_.

 

(a) In the event that any Gaming Approval has not been received but has not
been denied by the applicable Gaming Authority prior to the Closing and the
parties are required to consummate the Transaction with respect to such
Companies in jurisdictions in which Gaming Approvals have been received, then
the parties shall effect the Closing with respect to the Membership Interests
of the Companies for which Gaming Approvals have been received, use their
reasonable best efforts to consummate the closing with respect to the Excluded
Companies as promptly as practicable and, if necessary, negotiate in good
faith to enter into amendments to this Agreement as may be necessary to
effect the purchase and sale of such Membership Interests upon receipt of the
applicable Gaming Approvals in a delayed closing (it being understood that in
no event shall either party have any obligation to alter any material terms
of the Transaction, including the Base Purchase Price or the amount or kind of
consideration).

(b) In the event that Purchaser is not obligated pursuant to the proviso in
_Section_ __ _ 10.01(b)_ to acquire the Membership Interest of any Excluded
Company in respect of which Gaming Approvals have been finally denied, (i)
Purchaser shall find a replacement purchaser for such Excluded Company, which
replacement purchaser shall be a Discretionary Replacement Purchaser (as
defined in the Consent Agreement) or otherwise reasonably acceptable to Lessor
as contemplated by the Consent Agreement, (ii) the Purchaser Master Lease
shall exclude the premises consisting of the real property, and facilities,
improvements and fixtures thereon, associated with such Excluded Company ("
_Excluded Company Property_ "), and (iii) Purchaser shall cause such
replacement purchaser to enter into a lease (the " _Replacement Purchaser
Master Lease_ "), as lessee, for such Excluded Company Property on terms
consistent with the Seller Master Lease (and financial terms so that Lessor,
after considering the financial terms of the Purchaser Master Lease and the
Discretionary Replacement Purchaser Master Lease, in the aggregate, is in
substantially the same position it would have been had the Excluded Company
Property not been removed from the Purchaser Master Lease). If such Excluded
Company is sold to a replacement purchaser for total consideration that is
less than the applicable Company Purchase Price Allocation for such Excluded
Company (the amount of such shortfall, the " _Excluded Company Purchase Price
Shortfall_ "), Purchaser shall pay, within 20 Business Days of the closing of
the sale of such Excluded Company, the Excluded Company Purchase Price
Shortfall to Parent.

 



52 Section 9.12 _Closing Conditions_. From the date hereof until the Closing,
each party shall use reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are
necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in
_Article X_.

 

Section 9.13 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any party
(the " _Litigating Party_ ") is prosecuting, contesting or defending any

case to which Parent is or may be entitled under the Merger Agreement (any
such fee or expense reimbursement, a " _Break Fee_ "), Parent shall pay to
Purchaser promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days after
receiving any such Break Fee) an amount equal to 20% (the " _Purchaser Fee
Percentage_ ") of the aggregate of all such Break Fees (such amount, the "
_Purchaser Fee_ "). In no event shall Parent be required to pay to Purchaser
any portion of the aggregate Break Fees in excess of the amount of the
Purchaser Fee. Upon the payment by Parent to Purchaser of the Purchaser Fee,
neither Parent nor any of its respective Affiliates shall have any further
liability of any kind, whether at law or in equity, in tort or in contract or
otherwise, in connection with the Transaction, this Agreement, the Merger or
the Merger Agreement.

 

(d) _Merger Agreement Reverse Termination Fee_. If the Merger Agreement is
terminated and Parent pays any reverse termination fee, liquidated damages or
similar fee, or expense reimbursement to Seller in accordance with the terms
of the Merger Agreement (any such fee, damages or expense reimbursement paid
by Parent, a " _Reverse Break Fee_ ") and the termination of the Merger
Agreement and Parents liability to pay to Seller such Reverse Break Fee
thereunder is primarily and directly attributable to a material breach of this
Agreement by Purchaser (" _Material Purchaser Breach_ "), then Purchaser
shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the Purchaser Fee Percentage
_multiplied by_ the Reverse Break Fee; _provided_ that such amount required to
be paid by Purchaser to Parent shall in no event exceed $42,000,000, _unless_
 such

 



62  Material Purchaser Breach was willful or fraudulent and Purchaser had the
specific intent to cause a Material Purchaser Breach or such that one or more
of the conditions in  _Section_ __ _ 10.01_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.03_ is not
satisfied, in which case, such amount to be paid by Purchaser to Parent shall
in no event exceed $58,000,000 (the " _Maximum RTF Amount_ ", and any amount
to be paid by Purchaser to Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.02(d)_,
the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ "). Purchaser shall pay Parent the Reverse
Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days of Parent paying any Reverse
Break Fee to Seller. In no event shall Purchaser be required to pay more than
one Reverse Termination Fee and in no event shall Purchaser be liable for any
amount in excess of the Maximum RTF Amount. Upon the payment by Purchaser to
Parent of the Reverse Termination Fee, neither Purchaser nor Boyd nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall have any further liability of any kind,
whether at law or in equity, in tort or in contract or otherwise, in
connection with the Transaction, this Agreement, the Merger or the Merger
Agreement.

(e) Each of the parties acknowledges that the Purchaser Fee and the Reverse
Termination Fee are not intended to be a penalty, but rather are liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or Purchaser, as
the case may be, in the circumstances in which such Purchaser Fee or the
Reverse Termination Fee is due and payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision.

(f) Each of Parent, Boyd and Purchaser acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 11.02_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, Parent,
Boyd and Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly,
if a party fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 11.02_, then such party shall reimburse the other party for
all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of
counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in
connection with any related actions commenced and pay interest on such amount
from and including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding
the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

 

(g) _Specific Performance and Other Remedies._ For the avoidance of doubt,
prior to exercising any right of termination under  _Section_ __ _ 11.01_,
the non-breaching parties may, but shall not be required to, seek specific
enforcement or other available remedies in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
13.02(d)_.

Section 11.03 _Rescission_. In the event the FTC shall not have approved on
or prior to the Closing Date the FTC Order issued by it in disposition of its
proceeding relating to the Merger, and following the Closing Date, the FTC
shall have notified (such notification, the " _Regulatory Nonsatisfaction
Notice_ ") Parent or Seller in writing that, for purposes thereof, Purchaser
would not be an acceptable purchaser of the Purchased Assets and that the
Transaction is required to be rescinded, then Parent or Seller shall give
prompt written notice thereof to Purchaser (which notice shall include a copy
of the Regulatory Nonsatisfaction Notice) and the parties shall promptly take
all actions as may be necessary or desirable to rescind the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and to restore to each party its rights,

 



63  powers and obligations as in existence immediately prior to the Closing,
including (a) Seller refunding to Purchaser all funds received by Seller from
Purchaser as payment of the Purchase Price, (b) execution by Purchaser of
such assignments, transfers and other documents and instruments as may be
necessary or desirable to convey, assign and transfer back to Seller all of
Purchasers right, title and interest in and to the Purchased Assets and (c)
execution by Seller of such assumptions and other documents and instruments as
may be necessary or desirable to relieve Purchaser of all liability for any
Assumed Liabilities existing on the Closing Date.

or defense strategies available to such Indemnified Party that are different

Party shall be entitled to separate counsel ( _provided,_ that such counsel is
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party); and

 

(iii) compromise or settle such Third Party Claim, which compromise or
settlement shall be made either (x) only with the written consent of the

or delayed, or (y) if such compromise or settlement contains an unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim, without any
admission of wrongdoing of any nature whatsoever to or by such Indemnified
Party, and provides only for monetary damages that will be paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party under the terms of this Agreement;

 

 _provided, however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not have the right to
take control of and conduct the defense if such Third Party Claim involves
an injunction or equitable relief, non-monetary claims, or criminal
liability, in which case, the Indemnified Party will take control and conduct
the defense, compromise and settlement of such Third Party Claim (but such
Third Party Claim shall not be compromised or settled without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Indemnified Party or Parent Indemnified Party hereunder, (i) the amount of

costs of investigation of the underlying claim and collection, including
attorney fees, any increase in insurance premiums, collection costs and other

to be a general submission to the jurisdiction of such courts or any other
courts other than for such purpose, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any such court and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement or the Transaction in any court other than such
state or Federal court. Each of the parties irrevocably consents to
the service of any summons and complaint and any other process in any other
action relating to the Transaction, on behalf of itself or its property, by
the personal delivery of copies of such process to such party. Nothing in
this  _Section_ __ _ 13.02(b)_ shall affect the right of any party hereto to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTION. EACH PARTY

WAIVERS, (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND

(d) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that if a party fails to perform
its agreements and covenants hereunder, including if the party fails to take
all actions as are necessary on its part to consummate the Transaction, such
failure could cause irreparable injury to the non-breaching party, for which
damages, even if available, may not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, except
as otherwise limited by this Agreement, in the event of such a failure, the
non-breaching party shall be permitted to seek an issuance of injunctive
relief or a specific performance remedy (in each case, without the requirement
to post any bond or other security), from any court of competent
jurisdiction.

Section 13.04 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an
Article, Section or Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Unless the context otherwise requires: (a) a reference to a
document includes all amendments or supplements to, or replacements
or novations of, that document; (b) the use of the term "including" means
"including, without limitation"; (c) the word "or" shall be disjunctive but
not exclusive; (d) unless expressly provided otherwise, the measure of a
period of one month or year for purposes of this Agreement shall be that date
of the following month or year corresponding to the starting date; _provided_
, that if no corresponding date exists, the measure shall be that date of the
following month or year corresponding to the next day following the starting
date (for example, one month following February 18 is March 18, and one month
following March 31 is May 1); (e) a reference to an entity includes any
successor entity, whether by way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation or
other business combination; (f) reference to a word defined hereunder shall
apply equally to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined; and
(g) a reference to"$" or "dollars" mean the lawful currency of the United
States. The name assigned to this Agreement, the table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The
phrase "made available" in this Agreement means that on or before 5:00 p.m.
Pacific Time on the Effective Date, Seller has uploaded such materials or
information to the Data Room or Parent has provided to Boyd, Purchaser or
their Representatives such materials or information in writing.

Section 13.05 _Entire _ _Agreement_. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
and the Disclosure Letters and the other exhibits hereto and thereto
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with

 



92  respect to the subject matter hereof. In the event of any conflict or
inconsistency between this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement, this
Agreement shall control.

 

Section 13.06 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transaction is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the Transaction is fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 13.07  _Assignment_. Without the prior written consent of the other
parties, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned to any other Person. Any assignment in
violation of the preceding sentence shall be void, and no assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder.

Section 13.08 _Parties _ _of Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party and their respective successors
and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 13.09  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or
electronic mail transmission and/or in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall
be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement.

Section 13.10 _Mutual Drafting_. Each party has participated in the drafting
of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the parties. In the event that any ambiguity or question
of intent arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by
the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

 

Section 13.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Purchaser, Parent and
Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , subject to this _Section_ __ _ 13.11_, all
terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be subject to the substitution or
addition of modified or other terms and conditions as the FTC may require.
Each party agrees to accept such changes to this Agreement as shall be
required by the FTC and to negotiate in good faith and execute promptly an
appropriate amendment to this Agreement to reflect such required changes (an
" _Amendment_ "), unless such changes (i) would reasonably be expected to
have, in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) would require
a change in the Base Purchase Price, or (iii) would adversely affect the
economics of the Transaction (other than as a result of a requirement of a
change in the Base Purchase Price, which shall be subject to clause (ii));
_provided_ , that in the case of the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), only
the party whose economics would be adversely affected (the " _Affected Party_
") may elect not to execute an Amendment subject to compliance with the
remainder of this _Section_ __ _ 13.11_. Prior to entering any Amendment,
the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to seek

 



93  consultation with the FTC or its staff to review the Amendment in light of
the requirements of the FTC giving rise to such Amendment. If either party
elects not to execute an Amendment required to be executed pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 13.11_ or the Affected Party elects not to execute an
Amendment pursuant to the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii) and does not comply
with the remainder of this  _Section_ __ _ 13.11_, then such failure shall
be deemed to be a material breach of such partys obligations under this
Agreement. If an Affected Party elects not to execute an Amendment pursuant to
the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii), then the parties shall, in good faith,
use their respective reasonable best efforts to reach prompt (but in any event
within ten (10) Business Days after receiving the FTCs request to make the
required changes) mutual agreement with respect to an Amendment reflecting
such changes. If the parties, after complying with the preceding sentence are
unable to reach mutual agreement with respect to an Amendment within such ten
(10) Business Day period, then the parties shall submit the matters that the
parties have been unable to resolve with respect to such Amendment, including,
without limitation, economic accommodations arising from or related to the
changes required by the FTC, but excluding changes to the Base Purchase
Price, to an independent nationally recognized investment banking firm,
independent nationally recognized accounting firm, or other independent
arbitrator (" _Arbitrator_ ") mutually agreed upon by Parent and
Purchaser for final and binding resolution of such dispute in accordance with
procedures mutually agreed upon by Parent and Purchaser. If Parent and
Purchaser are unable to agree on an Arbitrator, then Parent and Purchaser
shall each select such an Arbitrator, and the two Arbitrators so selected
shall select a third Arbitrator to be the Arbitrator with respect to the
unresolved matters with respect to such Amendment. Subject to the last
sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 13.11_, the findings of the Arbitrator so
selected by Parent and Purchaser (or, if Parent and Purchaser are unable to
agree on an Arbitrator, so selected by the Arbitrators pursuant to the
foregoing sentence) shall be final and binding on all of the parties, and the
fees and expenses of the Arbitrator(s) shall be paid by one-half by Parent and
one-half by Purchaser. In the event that the findings of the
Arbitrator include a change (x) that adversely affect the economics of the
Transaction in respect of such party or (y) to the Base Purchase Price or
changes that cause either party to require a change to the Base Purchase
Price, the party who is not requiring the change in the Base Purchase Price
or whose economics would be adversely affected may elect not to execute an
Amendment and terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.01(j)_.

 

Section 13.12 _Waiver_. Any party may waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party.

 

Section 13.13 _Further Assurances_. In case at any time after the Closing any
further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each
of the parties shall take all commercially reasonable action necessary
(including executing and delivering further notices, assumptions, releases and
acquisitions).

 

Section 13.14 _No Recourse_. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney, consultant, representative or principal of Boyd, Purchaser or
any of their respective Affiliates shall have, and Boyd on behalf of such
Persons waives any right to assert or initiate, any claim, suit, proceeding
or other similar action, relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements,
the Merger or the Transaction against Seller and its Affiliates prior to the
execution and delivery of the Joinder.

 



94 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have caused this Agreement to be signed by
their respective duly authorized officers as of the date first written above.
