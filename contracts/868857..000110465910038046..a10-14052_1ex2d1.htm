Section 2.3 _Post-Closing Adjustment of Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the

Closing Adjustment Statement, the Buyer shall provide the Sellers and their
officers, directors, principals, employees who need to know, advisors,
auditors, agents, bankers and other representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") with access to the working papers of the Buyer relating
to the Closing Adjustment Statement, and the Buyer shall cooperate with the
Sellers and their Representatives to provide them with any other information
used in preparing the Closing Adjustment Statement reasonably requested by
the Sellers and their Representatives. The Closing Adjustment Statement
shall become final and binding on the 20th Business Day following delivery
thereof, unless prior to the end of such period, the Sellers deliver to the
Buyer written notice of disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_
") specifying the nature and amount of any disputed item. The Sellers shall
be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts in the Closing Adjustment
Statement not specifically referenced in the Notice of Disagreement, and such
items and amounts shall not be subject to review pursuant to Section 2.3(c).

(c) During the 10 Business Day period following delivery of a Notice of

Sellers shall provide the Buyer and its Representatives with access to the
working papers of the Sellers relating to such Notice of Disagreement, and
the Sellers and their auditors shall cooperate with the Buyer and its
Representatives to provide them with any other information used in
preparation of such Notice of Disagreement reasonably requested by the Buyer
or its auditors.  Any disputed items resolved in writing between the Sellers
and the Buyer within such 10 Business Day period shall be final and binding
with respect to such items, and if the Sellers and the

  



        
   

  



  

Buyer agree in writing on the resolution of each disputed item specified by
the Sellers in the Notice of Disagreement, the amount of the Closing Net
Working Capital, the Closing Debt and/or the Section 338(h)(10) Cost so
determined shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes
hereunder. If the Sellers and the Buyer have not resolved all such
differences by the end of such 10 Business Day period, the Sellers and the
Buyer shall submit, in writing, to a national independent public accounting
firm mutually acceptable to the parties (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_
"), briefs detailing their views as to the correct nature and amount of each
item remaining in dispute and the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital,
the Closing Debt and/or the Section 338(h)(10) Cost, as applicable, and the
Independent Accounting Firm shall make a written determination as to each
such disputed item and the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, the
Closing Debt and/or the Section 338(h)(10) Cost, as applicable, which
determination shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes
hereunder. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be authorized to resolve
only those items remaining in dispute between the parties in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 2.3 within the range of the difference between
the Buyers position with respect thereto and the Sellers position with
respect thereto. The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be accompanied by a certificate of the Independent Accounting Firm that it
reached such determination in accordance with the provisions of this Section
2.3. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if
such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other "Big 4" independent
public accounting firm as shall be agreed in writing by the Sellers and the
Buyer. The Sellers and the Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render a written decision
resolving the matters submitted to it within 20 Business Days following the
submission thereof.  Judgment may be entered upon the written determination
of the Independent Accounting Firm in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The costs of the Independent Accounting Firm, shall be borne by the parties
in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the
Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted. The fees and disbursements of the auditors and other
Representatives of each party incurred in connection with their preparation
or review of the Closing Adjustment Statement and preparation or review of
any Notice of Disagreement, as applicable, shall be borne by such party.

  



  

(d) (i) if the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 2.3 is greater than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital,
the Buyer shall pay such excess to the Sellers in accordance with Section
2.3(e);

  



  

(ii) if the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 2.3 is less than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, the
Sellers shall pay such deficiency to the Buyer in accordance with Section
2.3(e);

  



  

(iii) if the Closing Debt as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.3
is less than the Estimated Closing Debt, the Buyer shall pay such deficiency
to the Sellers in accordance with Section 2.3(e);

  



        
   

  



  

(iv) if the Closing Debt as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.3
is greater than the Estimated Closing Debt, the Sellers shall pay such excess
to the Buyer in accordance with Section 2.3(e);

  



  

(v) if the Section 338(h)(10) Cost as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.3 is less than the Estimated Section 338(h)(10) Cost, the Sellers
shall pay such deficiency to the Buyer in accordance with Section 2.3(e); and

  



  

(vi) if the Section 338(h)(10) Cost as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.3 is greater than the Estimated Section 338(h)(10) Cost, the Buyer
shall pay, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.7, such excess
to the Sellers in accordance with Section 2.3(e).

  



  

If a Notice of Disagreement has been delivered to the Buyer by the Sellers,
any payments due under this Section 2.3(d) as to which agreement has been
reached shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.3(e) and any payments due
under this Section 2.3(d) as to which agreement has not been reached shall be
paid within ten (10) Business Days following, and in accordance with, the
Independent Accounting Firms decision with respect to the disputed matters
and otherwise in accordance with Section 2.3(e). The amount of any adjustment
determined under this Section 2.3(d) shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

  



  

(e) Any payment to be made by the Buyer pursuant to Section 2.3(d) shall be
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts
as may be designated in writing by the Sellers at least two Business Days
prior to such payment date that shall be within 10 Business Days after such
final determination. Any payment to be made by the Sellers pursuant to
Section 2.3(d) shall be (i) in the case of Daniel R. Tishman, (A) by delivery
to the Buyer of shares of Parent Common Stock (based on the Parent Common
Stock Value) and (B) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account or accounts as may be designated in writing by the Buyer at least two
Business Days prior to such payment date that shall be within 10 Business
Days after such final determination, in each case, in the same proportion of
Parent Common Stock and immediately available funds as Daniel R. Tishman
received pursuant to Sections 2.2(c)(i)(A) and (B) and (ii) in the case of
the Sellers other than Daniel R. Tishman, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds by each Seller other than Daniel R. Tishman equal to 100% of
such Sellers payment to be made pursuant to Section 2.3(d) to such account
or accounts as may be designated in writing by the Buyer at least two
Business Days prior to such payment date that shall be within 10 Business
Days after such final determination. In the event that the Sellers shall
fail to make any such payment within the time period specified in the
immediately preceding sentence, the Buyer may deliver written notice to
the Escrow Agent and the Sellers specifying such amount (the " _Deficiency_
"), and the Escrow Agent shall pay the Deficiency out of the Indemnity Escrow
Fund to the Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement;
_provided_ , that the Sellers (A) shall promptly restore the Indemnity Escrow
Fund to the extent any funds are so paid and (B) shall remain liable in the
event the Indemnity Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the amount of
the Deficiency. No failure on the part of the Buyer to deliver a notice as

  



         
 

  



  

specified in the immediately preceding sentence shall relieve the Sellers of
the obligation to pay the amount of the Deficiency to the Buyer.

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter attached hereto (the "

business as it is currently conducted and (ii) duly qualified or licensed as

Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) The Company has heretofore furnished to the Buyer a complete and correct
copy of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents, each as amended to date, of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries. Such certificates of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent

acquire, or that relate to the holding, voting or disposition of or that
restrict the transfer of, the issued or unissued capital stock or
other equity or ownership interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. No shares of capital stock or other equity or ownership
interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been issued in
violation of any rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments under
any provision of applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws

and has legal, valid and good and marketable title to, the Shares set forth
opposite such Sellers name on _Schedule 3.4(b)_ of the Disclosure Letter,

ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ").

  



  

(c) None of the Plans is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section
3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a single

on or prior to the date hereof have been timely made, except where any

delinquent in any material respect in contributions or payments to any
Multiemployer Plan or other union pension, health or benefits funds,

  



        
   

  



  

which are required to be made under any collective bargaining agreement or
related trust agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, of the Multiemployer Plan or other pension, health or benefits funds
nor will the Company and its Subsidiaries be obligated to make any additional
contributions or payments to any Multiemployer Plan or other union pension,

(i) There are no suits, actions, written disputes, written claims (other than
routine claims for benefits), arbitrations, administrative or other

respects in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 601 of
ERISA, Section 4980B(b) of the Code and the applicable provisions of
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1986.

  



  

(m) Each Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined

expressed herein. Such Sellers acknowledge and understand that the Parent
Common Stock must be held indefinitely unless the Parent Common Stock is
subsequently registered under the Securities Act and, where applicable, such
other securities Laws or an exemption from such registration is available,
and that the Buyer is under no obligation to register the Parent Common
Stock. No Seller has received any general solicitation or general
advertisement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or an investment in the Buyer.

or

  



  

(ii) solicit, recruit or hire any person who at any time on or after the date

Vissicchio, his Affiliates (including Tishman Hotel and Realty LP, TTV Realty
Holdings, Inc. and their respective Affiliates) or search firms not
specifically directed at Company Group Employees or (ii) Vissicchio or any of
his Affiliates (including Tishman Hotel and Realty LP, TTV Realty Holdings,
Inc. and their respective Affiliates) from soliciting, recruiting or hiring
any Company Group Employee (x) at any time six (6) months or more after (or,

limitation, Tishman Hotel and Realty, LP and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates.

(c) Each party acknowledges that the covenants set forth in this Section 5.2
are an essential element of this Agreement and that any breach of any
provision of this Section 5.2 will result in irreparable injury to the non-
breaching parties. Each party acknowledges that in the event of such a
breach, in addition to all other remedies available at law, the non-breaching
parties shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief,
and an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits or other
benefits arising therefrom, as well as such other damages as may be
appropriate. Each party has independently consulted with his counsel and
after such consultation agrees that the covenants set forth in this Section
5.2 are reasonable and proper to protect the legitimate interest of the
parties.

  



  

(d) If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the character,
duration or geographical scope of the provisions of this Section 5.2 are
unreasonable, it is the intention and the agreement of the parties that these
provisions shall be construed by the court in such a manner as to impose only
those restrictions that are reasonable in light of the circumstances and as
are necessary to assure the benefits of this Agreement.  If, in any judicial
proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants of
this Section 5.2 because taken together they are more extensive than
necessary to assure the intended benefits of this Agreement, it is expressly
understood and agreed by the parties that the provisions hereof that, if
eliminated, would permit the remaining separate provisions to be enforced in
such proceeding, shall be deemed eliminated, for the purposes of such
proceeding, from this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Except as set forth in _Schedule
5.3_ of the Disclosure Letter, all intercompany and intracompany accounts or
contracts between the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and

remain in effect after the Closing.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Resignations_. The Company will deliver at the Closing

its Subsidiaries, effective as of the Closing, except for such directors

Section 5.6 _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall not, and the Sellers shall cause their Affiliates not to, and shall not
authorize the respective Representatives of the Sellers and their Affiliates
to, divulge or convey to any third party, any Confidential Information;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers, their Affiliates and/or their
Representatives may furnish such portion (and only such portion) of the
Confidential Information as any such Person reasonably determines he or it is
legally obligated to disclose if: (i) he or it receives a request to disclose
all or any part of the Confidential Information under the terms of
a subpoena, civil investigative demand, order issued by a Governmental
Authority or as otherwise compelled by Law; (ii) to the extent not
inconsistent with such request, he or it notifies the Buyer of the existence,
terms and circumstances surrounding such request and consults with the Buyer
on the advisability of taking steps available under applicable Law to resist
or narrow such request at the Buyers expense; (iii) to the extent not
inconsistent with such request, he or it cooperates with the Buyers efforts
to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded to the disclosed Confidential Information, at the Buyers
expense; and (iv) disclosure of such Confidential Information is required to
prevent such Person from being held in contempt or becoming subject to any
other penalty under applicable Law; _provided_ , that clauses (ii) and (iii)
above shall not apply to the Representatives of the Sellers and
their Affiliates. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Confidential
Information_ " consists of all information and data existing as of the date
hereof or derived therefrom and relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries
or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than data or information that
is or becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach of
this Section).

  



  

(b) Effective as of the Closing, each of the Sellers hereby assigns to the
Buyer all of the Sellers right, title and interest in and to any
confidentiality agreements with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
entered into by the Seller (or his Affiliates or Representatives on the
Sellers behalf) and each Person (other than the Buyer and its Affiliates and
Representatives) who in the twenty-four (24) months prior to the date hereof
entered into any such agreement and to whom Confidential Information was
provided in connection with a potential business combination involving the
Company or its Subsidiaries. From and after the Closing, the Sellers
will take all actions reasonably requested by the Buyer in order to assist
in enforcing the rights so assigned.

  



  

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_. The Sellers and the Buyer shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or other public statement
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and, except as may be
required by applicable Law, including the rules and regulations of the SEC
and the New York Stock Exchange, or any listing agreement of any party
hereto, shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement unless the text of such statement shall first have been approved by
the Buyer and the Sellers; _provided_ , that such approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Stock Bonuses_. The Company has recorded an accrual
for contemplated bonuses to certain of its executives in consideration for
services rendered

  



        
   

  



  

prior to Closing. The Buyer will cause this obligation to be discharged after
the Closing through the grant and issuance of restricted stock units (that
will be immediately vested and settled in unrestricted shares) covering a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock having a value equal to $4,000,000
(based on the value of the Parent Common Stock at the close of the market on
the date of grant, rounded up to the nearest whole share) to be issued under
the terms and conditions of Parents 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the "
_Unrestricted Bonus Shares_ "), which issuance shall be pursuant to
a registration statement on Form S-8.  The Buyer agrees that the award of
the Unrestricted Bonus Shares will not be conditioned on future performance
or continued tenure at the Buyer and/or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date, nor shall such awards be subject to
any forfeiture, clawback or similar mechanism. In addition, the Buyer will
grant and issue Performance Earnings Program units covering a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock having a value equal to $1,000,000 (based on
the value of the Parent Common Stock at the close of the market on the date
of grant, rounded up to the nearest whole share) to be issued under the terms
and conditions of Parents 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the " _Restricted Bonus
Shares_ " and, collectively with the Unrestricted Bonus Shares, the " _Bonus
Shares_ "), which issuance shall be pursuant to a registration statement on
Form S-8. The Buyer agrees that the Bonus Shares will be awarded to current
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as selected and in such amounts
determined by the Sellers in their sole discretion and shall be subject to
terms and conditions consistent with the Performance Earnings Program unit
awards granted to Parent employees for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 (including,
with respect to the Restricted Bonus Shares, the requirement for continued
employment and the achievement by Parent of financial performance goals). The
Bonus Shares shall be granted and issued by Parent not later than 45 days
following the Closing Date (at which time the Unrestricted Bonus Shares shall
be fully vested and freely tradable under applicable Law); _provided_ , that
the Bonus Shares shall be credited to the applicable employees account
within the later of (i) eight (8) Business Days after the date of grant and
(ii) three (3) Business Days after the date the applicable employee sets up
his or her Merrill Lynch brokerage link account for such Bonus Shares.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) Following the Closing Date, as and when the employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Employees_ ") become eligible to participate
in the Buyers employee benefit plans and programs (the " _Buyer Plans_ "),
the Buyer shall or shall cause the applicable plan or program sponsors to:
(i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting
periods applicable to such employees to the same extent such exclusions and
waiting periods would have been waived or would otherwise not have applied
under the Plans in which such employees were participating immediately prior
to participating in the applicable Buyer Plans; (ii) provide each such
employee with credit for any co-payments, co-insurance, deductibles and other
out-of-pocket expenses paid in satisfying any applicable deductible or other
out-of-pocket requirements under the Plans of the Company and its
Subsidiaries during the applicable Buyer Plan year in which the Company
Employee becomes a participant in the applicable Buyer Plan; and (iii)
recognize all service of such employees with the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and benefit determination or computation (but not
benefit accrual under any defined benefit

  



        
   

  



  

pension plan) to the same extent taken into account under the corresponding
Plan or policy in which such Company Employees participated immediately prior
to participating in the applicable Buyer Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that
this provision shall not be construed in any way that would result in a
duplication of benefits provided to any such Company Employee.  Until the
Company Employees become eligible to participate in the Buyer Plans, the
Buyer shall maintain the existing employee benefits plans and programs of the
Company and its Subsidiaries without any increase in employee costs (other
than to reflect increased premiums from third-party providers of such
existing employee benefits plans and programs) or reduction in benefits. To
the extent that, upon commencement of participation in the Buyer Plans, the
benefits provided to any Company Employee under the Buyer Plans and such
Company Employees cost contributions under such Buyer Plans are, in the
aggregate, less favorable to such Company Employee than the Plans in which
such Company Employee participated immediately prior to participating in the
applicable Buyer Plans, the Buyer shall make reasonable adjustments to the
compensation provided to such Company Employee.

  



  

(b) No provision of this Section 5.9 shall be treated as an amendment to any
Plan or Buyer Plan. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Section
5.9, the parties do not intend for this Section 5.9, or any term, provision,
condition or agreement contained herein, to amend any plans or arrangements
or create any rights or obligations except as between the parties, and no
past, present or future employee or consultant will be treated as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) In accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 414(l) of the
Code, the Buyer shall cause the assets and liabilities of the Tishman Realty
and Construction Co., Inc. Defined Contribution Plan, amended and restated as
of January 1, 2008 (the " _TCC 401(k) Plan_") attributable to the accounts
(whether or not vested) of each participant who is an employee of Tishman
Hotel and Realty LP or its Subsidiaries, TVB Corporation or Janus Equities,
LLC (collectively, " _Affected Employees_ ") to be transferred to the trustee
of the applicable defined contribution plan qualified under Sections 401(a)
and 401(k) of the Code adopted by the Sellers or their Affiliates for
the benefit of the Affected Employees (the " _New 401(k) Plans_"). The Buyer
shall take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to effectuate such
transfer. Such transfer of assets and liabilities shall be made on or about
August 25, 2010 (the " _401(k) Transfer Date_") and shall be made in the
form of in-kind transfers, or where the applicable underlying investment fund
will not be offered under the New 401(k) Plans, in cash equal to the net
proceeds derived from the liquidation of the relevant Affected Employees
interest in such underlying fund (whether or not vested), and shall include
any promissory notes or other evidences of indebtedness with respect to
outstanding loans. During the period commencing on the Closing Date through
the 401(k) Transfer Date, Affected Employees shall be permitted to continue
to repay outstanding loans to the TCC 401(k) Plan by check.

  



  

(d) The bonus practices in effect immediately prior to the Closing with
respect to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who, during the
sixty days prior to the date hereof, were reclassified by the Company as non-
exempt for the purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act shall not be altered
in any way adverse to such employees during the 18-month period following the
Closing.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 5.10 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance Coverage_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing Date for any acts or omissions before the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to their directors and officers pursuant to any indemnification
provisions under the certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on
the date hereof and pursuant to any indemnity agreements between the Company,
its Subsidiaries and any such persons as in effect on the date hereof (the
persons entitled to be indemnified pursuant to such provisions, and all other
current and former directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, being referred to collectively as the " _D andO Indemnified
Parties_"). From and after the Closing Date through the sixth anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
maintain the provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation from
liability as set forth in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws or
similar organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified during such period in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Party.

  



  

(b) This Section 5.10 shall survive the Closing Date, is intended to benefit
and may be enforced by the Company, the Buyer and the DandO Indemnified
Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Buyer and
the Company.

  



  

Section 5.11 _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, the Sellers,
the Company, the Buyer and the Parent shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law
or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements as promptly as practicable.

(a) The Buyer hereby acknowledges that (i) many of the Contracts of the
Company and its Subsidiaries are terminable by the counterparty at will or
otherwise without cause and (ii) the Contracts of the Company and its
Subsidiaries may require consent to, or notice of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the Buyer acknowledges and agrees that,
without limiting any of the Companys representations in Article III, it will
have no recourse, claim or other remedy against the Sellers or their
Affiliates or the Indemnity Escrow Fund as a result of any such termination
of a Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries or the failure to obtain any
such consent or provide any such notice.

  



  

(b) The Parent agrees to cooperate with the Sellers to enable the Sellers to
transfer the shares of the Parent Common Stock they receive as the Closing
Stock Payment without registration under the Securities Act, within the
limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act, and agrees to take actions reasonably requested by the
Sellers, including promptly causing the legend to be

  



        
   

  



  

removed from any certificate of Parent Common Stock to be so transferred, to
the extent permitted by federal securities laws. The Parent agrees
to promptly file an application for the listing of such shares of the
Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange and to take all
appropriate actions to cause such application to become effective as promptly
as practicable.

any projections, forecasts, business plans, estimates or budgets delivered to
or made available to the Buyer or any other Person, or (iii) with respect
to any other information or documents made available at any time to the Buyer
or any other Person.

other than the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Seller Group_ "), on the
other hand, share office space at 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York and

_Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ");

  



  

(iii) the failure of the Sellers to comply with their obligations under this
Article VI; and

  



  

(iv) any Transfer Taxes allocated to the Sellers pursuant to Section 6.10;

  



  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers shall have no obligation to the
Buyer Indemnified Parties under any provision of this Agreement from and
against any Taxes to the extent such Taxes arise as a result of any action
taken outside of the ordinary course of business (without regard to past
practice), including the making of any retroactive election or the
amendment of any Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, by or at the
direction of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing.

  



  

(b) The covenants and indemnities under this Article VI shall survive until
5:00 P.M. Eastern time on the 30th day following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extension thereof).

  



  

Section 6.2 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

  



  

(a) (i) The Sellers shall join with the Buyer in making an election pursuant
to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding provisions under
state or local Law) with respect to the acquisition of the Shares pursuant to
this Agreement (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_"). The
Buyer shall take all steps necessary in order to effectuate the Section
338(h)(10) Election in accordance with applicable Laws and the Sellers shall
cooperate with the Buyer in all respects necessary to validly make such
election in a timely manner. In particular, and not by way of limitation, in
order to effect such Section 338(h)(10) Election, the Sellers shall deliver
at Closing an IRS Form 8023 and any corresponding forms under applicable
state or local Law that have been requested by the Buyer at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Section
338(h)(10) Election Forms_");

  



  

(ii) the Sellers and the Buyer shall agree on the form and content of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election Forms and shall jointly execute any such forms;
and

  



  

(iii) the Buyer shall timely file such Section 338(h)(10) Election Forms, or
cause such forms to be timely filed, with the IRS and any applicable state or
local Taxing authority.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) The Buyer shall provide each Seller with a copy of any such form so filed
within fifteen (15) days after filing.

  



  

(c) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Sellers a draft schedule allocating the Purchase
Price and the liabilities of the Company and its qualified subchapter S
subsidiaries (plus other relevant items) among the assets of the Company and
its qualified subchapter S subsidiaries (the " _Section 338 Allocation_").
 The Buyer shall prepare the allocation in a manner consistent with
the methodology set forth in _Schedule 6.2(c)_ of the Disclosure Letter and
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-6. Within thirty (30) days of delivery of
the Section 338 Allocation, the Sellers shall notify the Buyer of any
proposed changes. If the parties cannot agree on a Section 338 Allocation or
the form and content of the IRS Form 8883, the dispute shall be resolved by
the Independent Accounting Firm consistent with the methodology set forth in
_Schedule 6.2(c)_ of the Disclosure Letter and Treasury Regulation Section
1.338-6 before the date that is the date the Section 338 Election is required
to be made, with the cost of such resolution to be determined pursuant to
Section 2.3(c).

  



  

(d) The Section 338 Allocation (as originally proposed or as revised in
accordance with this Agreement, as the case may be) shall be used in
preparing IRS Form 8883 (and any similar forms required under state or local
Law), which form shall be completed, executed and delivered by the parties as
soon as reasonably practicable after the finalization of the Section 338
Allocation, but in no event later than sixty (60) days before the due date
for the filing of such form. The Buyer and the Sellers agree to file and to
cause the Company to file all federal, state, local and foreign Returns in
accordance with the Section 338 Allocation (as originally proposed or as
revised in accordance with this Agreement, as the case may be), and agree not
to take, or cause to be taken, any action that would be inconsistent with
such Section 338 Allocation in any Return. For the sake of clarity, subject to
the provisions of this subsection (d), the Buyer (and not the Sellers)
shall be responsible for filing the Section 338(h)(10) Election executed
by both parties.

  



  

Section 6.3 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The parties shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives
reasonably to cooperate, in all Tax matters, including in preparing and
filing all Returns and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to
all taxable periods or relating to Taxes, and including maintaining and
making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Sellers. The Buyer and the
Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby).

  



  

Section 6.4 _Tax Returns_.

  



  

(a) The Sellers shall properly prepare or cause to be properly prepared and,
if permitted to be filed by the Sellers, timely file (i) all S Corporation
Returns of the Company for periods ending on or before the Closing Date and
(ii) all other Income Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than

  



        
   

  



  

Income Tax Returns for any Straddle Period), and pay any Income Taxes payable
with respect thereto. Except to the extent otherwise required by Law, all
such Returns shall be prepared consistent with past practices for
such entities. Such Returns shall not include any income resulting from any
transaction outside the ordinary course of business undertaken on the Closing
Date after the Closing at the direction of the Buyer. The Sellers shall
provide the Buyer with drafts of all Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries prepared by the Sellers due after the Closing no later than
thirty (30) days prior to the earlier of the due date or filing date thereof
and the Buyer shall have the right to review and provide comments on any such
Returns during the fifteen (15) day period following the receipt of such
Returns. Any disputed comments shall be resolved in accordance with Section
6.4(b)(iii).

  



  

(b) The Buyer or the Company shall (i) properly prepare or cause to be
properly prepared all Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries (other than
Returns referred to in the first sentence of Section 6.4(a)) that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date, and (ii) timely file or cause to
be timely filed each Return required to be filed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. Except to the extent otherwise required
by Law, such Returns for a Straddle Period shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with the past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(i) The Buyer or the Company shall provide the Sellers with drafts of all
Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries prepared by the Buyer or the
Company no later than thirty (30) days prior to the earlier of the due date
or filing date thereof, but only to the extent such Returns would impact
Returns previously filed by the Sellers, or affect Taxes which the Sellers
may be liable under applicable Law or this Agreement. The Sellers shall have
the right to review and provide comments on any such Returns during the
fifteen (15) day period following the receipt of such Returns. Any disputed
comments shall be resolved in accordance with Section 6.4(b)(iii).

  



  

(ii) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the due date for the
payment of any Taxes with respect to any Income Tax Return of the Company or
its Subsidiaries filed by the Buyer or the Company or its Subsidiaries for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (giving effect to any extension), the Sellers
shall pay the Company an amount equal to the portion of the Income Taxes
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, as determined pursuant to Section
6.5, as applicable, to the extent that such Taxes are not reflected as a
liability in the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant
to Section 2.3.

  



  

(iii) The Sellers and the Buyer shall consult with each other and attempt in
good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of such Returns and, if
they are unable to do so, the items disputed pursuant to Section 6.4(a) or
Section 6.4(b)(i), as applicable, shall be resolved (within a reasonable
time, taking into account the deadline for filing such Return) by the
Independent Accounting Firm. Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant
Return shall be timely filed on that basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
after using reasonable best efforts, the parties are unable to resolve the
matter in dispute before any Return that is the subject of a disagreement is
due, such Return may be filed as prepared by the Buyer and the
Company, subject to adjustment or amendment upon

  



        
   

  



  

resolution, and the making of any payments necessary to give effect to the
resolution. The costs and expenses relating to the dispute resolution shall
be borne equally by the parties hereto.

  



  

Section 6.5 _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, in the
case of any Taxes that are payable for a taxable period that begins on or
before, and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the
portion of such Taxes that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period (i) in the
case of any property or ad valorem Taxes, shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on (and including) the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Tax period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, shall be deemed equal to
the amount which would be payable as computed on a "closing-of-the-books"
basis if the relevant Tax period ended at 5:00 P.M. Eastern time on the
Closing Date. To the extent permissible under applicable Law, the parties
shall cause the Tax period of the Company in each applicable jurisdiction to
end at 5:00 P.M. Eastern time (or otherwise) on the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 6.6 _Amended Returns, Tax Refunds and Loss Carrybacks_. The Buyer
shall not (i) amend any Income Tax Return filed with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Return with
respect to a Straddle Period), (ii) make any retroactive election in respect
of Income Taxes or (iii) take any similar action that has an adverse effect
on Sellers tax liability, in each case without the express written consent
of the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
denied.

  



  

(b) Any refunds or credits of Income Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods of the Company or any Subsidiary, plus any interest received with
respect thereto from the applicable Governmental Authority (including refunds
or credits arising by reason of amended Returns filed after the Closing Date)
shall be the property of and held in trust for Sellers and shall be paid by
the Buyer to Sellers within ten (10) Business Days after the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates receives such refund or after the relevant Return is filed in
which the credit is actually recognized by the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, except to the extent any such refund is reflected as a current
asset in the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to
Section 2.3.

  



  

(c) If applicable, the Buyer shall elect, and shall cause its Affiliates to
elect, to waive any right to carry back any item of loss, deduction or credit
of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries that arises in a taxable year or
period ending after the Closing Date to any taxable year or period ending on
or before the Closing Date under Section 172(b)(3) of the Code or any
comparable provision of state or local Tax Law.

  



  

Section 6.7 _Tax Payment_.

  



  

(a) The Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall promptly and timely pay to
the Sellers pursuant to Section 2.2 and Section 2.3, an amount equal to the
Section 338(h)(10) cost (the " _Section 338(h)(10) Cost_").

  



        
   

  



  

(b) The Section 338(h)(10) Cost equals 20% of the net income or gain
resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election that is attributable to the
recognition of items of gain, income, loss, and deduction that were
previously unrecognized under the cash method of accounting (such amount, the
" _CTA Liability_ "); plus an additional "gross-up" payment in respect of
U.S. federal, state and local Taxes payable by the Sellers by virtue of the
increase in the Purchase Price attributable to the Section 338(h)(10)
Cost (such amount, the " _Gross-Up Payment_ ") so that the net realized value
by the Sellers, on an after-tax basis, after receipt by the Sellers of
the Gross-Up Payment, equals the CTA Liability.

  



  

(c) The Company shall make commercially reasonable efforts to keep the CTA
Liability to $8,000,000 or less by the Closing Date.

  



  

(d) The maximum aggregate amount of the CTA Liability which may be recovered
from the Buyer under this Agreement shall be an amount equal to $8,000,000;
_provided_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to the Gross-Up
Payment.

  



  

(e) The amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be determined in accordance with
_Schedule 6.7_ of the Disclosure Letter. In no event shall the Sellers be
required to make available their personal Returns or other personal Tax
information.

  



  

Section 6.8 _Tax Contests_.

  



  

(a) The Buyer shall promptly notify the Sellers in writing upon receipt by
the Buyer or the Company of a written notice of any pending or threatened Tax
audits or assessments for which the Sellers may be liable under applicable
Law or under this Agreement (" _Tax Contest Claims_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , no failure or delay by the Buyer to provide notice of a Tax
Contest Claim shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligation of the Sellers
hereunder except that nothing contained herein shall prevent the Sellers from
making a claim for damages incurred if the Sellers are actually prejudiced
thereby.  The Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate with each other in the
conduct of any Tax Contest Claim. The Sellers shall have the right to
control the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim for which one or more of the
Sellers are liable under applicable Law or under this Agreement for any
amount of Tax payable with respect to such Tax Contest Claim (any such claim,
a " _Sellers  Tax Contest Claim_") and shall bear the full cost of pursuing
any such claim.  However, if in the sole discretion of the Buyer the matter
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Buyer or the Company
with respect to any taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the
Closing Date (a " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ ") or with respect to a Tax for
any period for which Seller is not liable to pay hereunder:

  



  

(i) the Sellers shall keep the Buyer informed regarding the progress and
substantive aspects of any Sellers Tax Contest Claim, including providing
the Buyer with all written materials relating to such Tax proceeding received
from the relevant Governmental Authority or presented to such Governmental
Authority by Sellers;

  



     

      
 

  



  

(ii) the Buyer shall be entitled to participate in any Sellers Tax Contest
Claim, including having an opportunity to comment on any written materials
prepared in connection with any Sellers Tax Contest Claim and attending any
conferences relating to any Sellers Tax Contest Claim; and

  



  

(iii) the Sellers shall not compromise or settle a Sellers Tax Contest
Claim, without obtaining the Buyers prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or denied; _provided_ , that such
consent shall only be necessary if a compromise or settlement of any Sellers
Tax Contest Claim would reasonably be expected to result in adverse tax
consequences to the Buyer or the Company.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Buyer shall control all other
audit, examination or administrative or judicial proceedings in respect of
Taxes.

  



  

Section 6.9 _Conflict with Article VII_. In the event of any conflict between
Article VII and this Article VI with respect to indemnification for Taxes,
this Article VI shall control. Any provision of Article VII not in conflict
with this Article VI but that is supplemental or additive to the provisions
of this Article VI shall be deemed incorporated into this Article VI.  There
shall be no duplication of recovery for any Losses or Taxes indemnified or
paid pursuant to this Article VI and Article VII or any other provision of
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.10 _Transfer Taxes_. The Sellers and the Buyers shall each
be liable for, and shall indemnify the other for, 50% of all Transfer Taxes
(and any interest, penalties or additions to such Transfer Taxes) resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  " _Transfer Tax_ "
means any Tax imposed on the transferor or transferee of property by any
taxing jurisdiction by reason of the transfer, or any Tax that becomes a lien
on the property transferred by reason of the transfer, including without
limitation any stamp duty, sales, use or excise Tax, real estate transfer
Taxes or Taxes of a similar nature, including any interest, penalties or
additions to Tax that become payable with respect to such Tax. "Transfer Tax"
shall not include any Taxes imposed on a seller or transferor of property
that is measured by reference to the net income or gain of the seller or
transferor. The Sellers and Buyer shall fully cooperate with respect to the
filing of any Returns and any Tax audits or assessments related to such
Transfer Taxes.

  



  

Section 6.11 _Treatment of Payments_. The parties agree to treat any
indemnity payments under the terms of this Agreement and the Section
338(h)(10) Cost as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Income Tax
purposes.

  



  

Section 6.12 _Successors_. For purposes of this Article VI, reference to any
entity shall include successors.

Section 7.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_.

  



  

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company (including with respect
to the Sellers) and the Buyer contained in this Agreement shall survive for a

representations and warranties in Sections 3.1(a), 3.2, 3.4, 3.15(k), 3.24,
4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 4.6 are collectively referred to herein as the " _Core
Representations_ ".

  



  

(b) None of the Company, the Sellers (directly or through the Indemnity
Escrow Fund) or the Buyer shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to
any such representations and warranties unless a claim is made hereunder
prior to the expiration of the survival period for such representation and
warranty, in which case such representation and warranty shall survive as to
such claim until such claim has been finally resolved.

  



  

Section 7.2 _Indemnification by the Sellers_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, the Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) and the respective Representatives, successors
and assigns of each of the foregoing (the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ")
shall be indemnified, defended and held harmless by the Sellers solely from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund, from and against any and all Losses asserted
against, incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the foregoing as a result
of, arising out of or relating to:

  



  

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company
(including with respect to the Sellers) contained in Article III of this
Agreement;

  



  

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Sellers or the Company
contained in this Agreement; and

  



  

(iii) the reclassification of personnel as described in _Schedule 3.11(c)_
of the Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tishman Group, on the one hand, and
the Vissicchio Group, on the other hand, shall severally, and not jointly and
not jointly and severally, subject to Section 9.14, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any and all

foregoing as a result of, arising out of or relating to:

  



  

(i) any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the
Core Representations (other than Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 4.6), Section
5.2, Section 5.6 and Article VI;

  



  

(ii) medical benefits to which an employee of the Company may be entitled by
reason of his or her retirement pursuant to any plan, policy, program,

  



        
   

  



  

agreement or arrangement sponsored by the Company prior to Closing (including
the Tishman Realty and Construction Co. Group Health Plan or any successor
plan), other than benefits required to be provided pursuant to Section 4980B
of the Code, Section 601 of ERISA or any similar state law; and

  



  

(iii) the Tishman Construction Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan or any
similar or successor plan sponsored by the Company prior to the Closing.

  



  

Section 7.3 _Indemnification by the Buyer_. From and after the Closing the
Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates and the respective Representatives, successors and
assigns of each of the foregoing (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from
and against any and all Losses asserted against, incurred, sustained or
suffered by any of the foregoing as a result of, arising out of or relating
to:

  



  

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Buyer contained
in Article IV of this Agreement;

  



  

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Buyer or the Parent
contained in this Agreement; and

  



  

(c) the Contract and matters set forth in _Schedule 7.3(c)_ of the
Disclosure Letter.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Procedures_.

  



  

(a) _Third Party Actions_.

  



  

(i) In order for a party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out
of or involving a Loss or a claim or demand made by any person against the
Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall
deliver a written notice thereof (describing, to the extent practicable, such
matter in reasonable detail and such notice must be accompanied by a copy of
any written notice of the third party claimant to the Indemnified Party
asserting the Third Party Claim) to the party against whom indemnity is
sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with reasonable promptness after such
Indemnified Party receives written notice or otherwise obtains knowledge of
the Third Party Claim and shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such
information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request. The failure by the Indemnified Party to provide such written notice,
however, (so long as a notice pursuant to this Section 7.4(a)(i) is given
before the expiration of the applicable period set forth in Section
7.1(a)) shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this Article VII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnified Party shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Party copies of all other notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to any
Third Party Claim.

  



        
   

  



  

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party against any and all Losses that may result
from a Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 15 days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified
Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense
thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
 Where the Sellers are the Indemnifying Party, they shall have the right to
an advancement or reimbursement of their defense costs from time to time from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, if
the Sellers have assumed the defense of such Third Party Action
pursuant hereto. If the Indemnifying Party does not expressly elect to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within the time period and
otherwise in accordance with this Section 7.4(a)(ii), the Indemnified Party
shall have the sole right to proceed diligently to defend such matter with
the assistance of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not settle, adjust or
compromise such matter, or admit any liability with respect to such matter,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).  If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense thereof, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel or other expenses incurred on behalf of the
Indemnified Party in connection with such matter shall be at the expense of
the Indemnified Party, unless (A) the Indemnifying Party fails to defend
diligently or in good faith the action or proceeding within fifteen (15) days
after receiving notice of such failure from the Indemnified Party, (B) the
employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing
by the Indemnifying Party, (C) the Indemnified Party reasonably determines
(upon advice of its counsel) that representation by counsel to the
Indemnifying Party of both the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party
may present such counsel with a conflict of interest or, with respect to such
claims, the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party may have different,
conflicting, or adverse legal positions or interests, or (D) the Indemnified
Party reasonably determines (upon advice of its counsel) that there may be
one or more legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party or other
Indemnified Parties that are not available to the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable ways with the
Indemnifying Party and its agents in such defense and make available to the
Indemnifying Party all witnesses, Indemnified Partys employees, advisors and
agents, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified
Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys direct or indirect
control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party.
The Indemnifying Party shall bear all out-of-pocket expenses of the
Indemnified Party under this Section 7.4(a)(iii).

  



  

(iv) The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim (whether or not the
Indemnified Party is an actual

  



        
   

  



  

or potential party to such claim) if such settlement, compromise or judgment
(x) involves a finding or admission of wrongdoing, (y) does not include an
unconditional written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified
Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (z) imposes
equitable remedies or any obligation, including a restriction of the conduct
of business in the future, on the Indemnified Party other than solely the
payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified
hereunder.

  



  

(v) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to require that any action
be made or brought against any other Person before action is brought or claim
is made against it hereunder by the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(vi) To the extent that the Indemnifying Party makes or is required to make
any indemnification payment to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any rights and
remedies (including rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other
rights of recovery) that the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified
Partys Affiliates may have against any other Person (other than any customer
of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys Affiliates, unless
such customer restriction is waived by the Indemnified Party in its sole and
absolute discretion) with respect to any Losses to which such indemnification
payment is directly related; _provided_ , that to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is not entitled to exercise, or be subrogated to, such rights and
remedies against a customer of the Indemnified Party or any of the
Indemnified Partys Affiliates, then notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary contained herein, the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to any
indemnification with respect to such Losses under this Article VII that could
reasonably be expected to have been indemnified, contributed or recovered if
the Indemnifying Party had been able to exercise, or be subrogated to, such
rights and remedies against such customer, and such Losses shall not be
counted toward satisfaction of the Deductible.

  



  

(b) _Direct Claims_. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
against any Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party
Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified
Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice of such claim
with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party and the Escrow Agent, if
applicable, of the nature and, to the extent practicable, a good faith
estimate of the amount, of the claim, which notice (i) must certify that the
Indemnified Party has in good faith already sustained some (though
not necessarily all) Losses with respect to such claim, and (ii) if
the Indemnified Party is asserting a claim for breach of any of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.16 (an " _Environmental
Breach_ "), must be accompanied by a written report from a reputable
nationally or regionally recognized environmental consulting firm confirming,
in reasonable detail, the existence of the conditions as to which an
Environmental Breach is claimed. The failure to provide such notice,
however, (so long as a notice pursuant to this Section 7.4(b), including the
requisite certification, is given before the expiration of the applicable
period set forth in Section 7.1(a)) shall not release the Indemnifying Party
from any of its obligations under this Article VII except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby and
shall not relieve the Indemnifying

  



        
   

  



  

Party from any other obligation or liability that it may have to the
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VII. Indemnification Limitations
and Conditions.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Indemnification Limitations and Conditions_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i)
neither of the Sellers nor the Indemnity Escrow Fund, on the one hand, nor
the Buyer, on the other hand, shall be liable for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) or Section 7.3(a), as the case
may be, unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which
may be recovered from the Sellers and the Indemnity Escrow Fund, on the one
hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand, exceeds $4,000,000 (the " _Deductible_
"), in which case the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover such
Losses arising out of or relating to such claims only to the extent in excess
thereof, (ii) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may
be recovered from the Sellers and the Indemnity Escrow Fund, on the one hand,
and the Buyer, on the other hand, arising out of or relating to the causes
set forth in Section 7.2(a)(i) or Section 7.3(a), as the case may be, shall
be an amount equal to $30,000,000, (iii) any indemnification claim pursuant
to Section 7.2(a)(i) or Section 7.3(a), as the case may be, involving Losses
of less then $50,000 shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
Article VII and shall not be counted toward satisfaction of the Deductible;
_provided_ , that the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall not apply
to Losses arising out of or relating to the breach of any representation or
warranty made in any Core Representation, (iv) the Sellers, whose liability
with respect to Section 7.2(a) shall be solely through the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, shall only be liable through the Indemnity Escrow Fund for fifty
percent (50%) of any Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(iii) and (v) the
maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(iii) shall be
$3,000,000. No Losses shall be included in determining whether the Deductible
has been reached unless a notice seeking indemnification for such Losses has
been given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party in accordance
with Section 7.4.  The Indemnified Party may not make a claim for
indemnification under Section 7.2(a)(i) or Section 7.3(a), as the case may
be, for breach of a particular representation or warranty after the
expiration of the survival period thereof specified in Section 7.1, and the
Buyer Indemnified Parties may not make a claim for indemnification under
Section 7.2(a) after the first Business Day following the 18-month
anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if a claim is
made hereunder prior to the expiration of such survival period, the right to
indemnification under Section 7.2(a) shall survive as to such claim until
such claim has been finally resolved.

  



  

(b) Except for (i) remedies for injunctive relief or specific performance,
(ii) claims for fraud against the party committing such fraud (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, none of the indemnification limitations in Sections 7.1
or 7.5(a) would be applicable to any such claims) or (iii) claims arising
from Losses described in Section 7.2(b), the indemnification rights set forth
in Article VI and this Article VII shall be (x) the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Buyer Indemnified Parties (and shall only be enforceable against
the Indemnity Escrow Fund) whether in contract, tort or otherwise, for any
claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereunder, including, without

  



        
   

  



  

limitation, for any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth herein and neither the Buyer, the Parent nor
any of their Affiliates (or anyone claiming by or through them) shall seek or
claim, whether by or through attempted piercing the corporate veil, alter ego
or similar theory or claim, as applicable, by or through any other claim
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise), or by virtue of any applicable Law,
that any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller has any liability or
obligation hereunder or with respect to any of the transactions contemplated
hereby other than as set forth in Article VI and this Article VII (including
clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 7.5(b)), and (y) the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Seller Indemnified Parties whether in contract, tort
or otherwise, for any claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereunder, including, without limitation, for any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth
herein.

  



  

(c) An Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Loss for which an indemnification claim is asserted pursuant to
this Article VII, including, without limitation, seeking insurance recoveries
and other indemnification or contribution recoveries; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnified Party shall determine, in its sole and
absolute discretion, whether to seek recovery for any Losses from any of the
Indemnified Partys or its Affiliates (including, in the case of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, the Companys and each of its Subsidiaries) clients or
whether to take any other action that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect client relations or the conduct of its business in the
future; _provided_ ,  _further_ that in the event an Indemnified Party fails
to take such commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate any such Losses,
then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the
Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to any indemnification with respect
to such Losses under this Article VII that could reasonably be expected to
have been avoided if the Indemnified Party had taken such efforts, and such
Losses shall not be counted towards the satisfaction of the Deductible.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the
Indemnifying Party makes any payment or incurs expenses (including without
limitation attorneys fees) in connection with an indemnity claim for which
it is ultimately determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification or is entitled to indemnification in a lesser amount than
originally determined, the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for the amount of such overpayment or expenses, including,
without limitation, (i) as a result of any subsequent receipt of insurance,
indemnity or contribution payments by the Indemnified Party after the
indemnification payment was made and (ii) indemnification payments to which
the Indemnified Party was not entitled pursuant to Section 7.4(a)(vi) or
Section 7.5(c).

  



  

Section 7.6 _Indemnity Escrow Fund_. The specific terms of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund shall be governed by the Escrow Agreement. Subject and pursuant
to the procedures contained in the Escrow Agreement, the Buyer, on behalf of
itself and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties, shall be entitled to withdraw
assets from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to compensate the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for any indemnified Losses pursuant to Section 7.2.

Parent, the Buyer or the Company in respect of any of their obligations
hereunder, under the Ancillary Agreements or otherwise. The parties hereto
agree that any third party beneficiaries to this Agreement and any
