AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of October 30, 2006, by and among MERCK and CO., INC., a New Jersey corporation (" _Parent_ "), SPINNAKER ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and SIRNA THERAPEUTICS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved this Agreement, and deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (the " _Merger_ ") whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ "), other than the Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries) and the Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole stockholder in Merger Sub, will approve the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby by written consent immediately following the execution hereof; 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, desire to make those representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in connection with this Agreement; and 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a Voting Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of and reliance upon the premises and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

The Merger; Closing; Effective Time  

  

 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in 

   ##### 

  

    

Article II of this Agreement. The Merger shall have the effects specified in
the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ "). 

  

 1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between Parent and the Company, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of OMelveny and Myers LLP, 275 Battery Street, San Francisco, California 94111-3305, at 5:00 P.M. local time on the second (2nd) business day (the " _Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement. 

  

 1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, Parent and the Company will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by Parent and the Company in writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 of the Surviving Corporation  

  

 2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended in its entirety to read as set forth as Exhibit B hereto and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

 2.2. _The Bylaws_. The Bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or in accordance with the Charter and applicable Law. 

  

ARTICLE III 

   

Officers and Directors 
 of the Surviving Corporation  

  

 3.1. _Directors_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws. 

  

 3.2. _Officers_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or

in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws. 

  

ARTICLE IV 

   

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
 Exchange of Certificates  

  

 4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, on the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company: 

  

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock (i) owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (collectively, the " _Parent Companies_ "), (ii) owned by the Company or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company, or (iii) shares of Common Stock (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") that are owned by stockholders (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") properly exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (each, an " _Excluded Common Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Common Shares_ ")) shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $13.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all shares of Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shares of Common Stock shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any such shares of Common Stock (other than Excluded Common Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to the Merger Consideration and any Dissenting Shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the applicable payments set forth in Section 4.3. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by any of the Parent Companies, the Company or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company (in each case, other than such shares of Common Stock that are held on behalf of third parties) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. 

  

 (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Each right to purchase Common Stock (a " _Purchase Right_ ") outstanding for the Offering Period under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( the " _ESPP_ ") that terminates at the Effective Time shall be cancelled and each participant in the ESPP for that Offering Period shall be entitled to receive, within ten (10) business days of the Effective Time, in lieu of any other consideration otherwise payable to such participant under the ESPP with respect to such Purchase Right, an amount in cash equal to (a) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (b) the number of whole and fractional shares of 

   ##### 

  

    

Common Stock that would have been issuable upon exercise of such Purchase
Right had it been exercised at the Effective Time and the participant
purchased the maximum number of shares subject thereto using the full amount
of his or her accumulated payroll deductions to the ESPP for that Offering
Period, all such actions to have the same effect as described in Section
12(b)(iii) of the ESPP. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 4.1(d)
shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is
required under applicable Tax Law. 

  

 4.2. _Exchange of Certificates for Shares_. 

  

 (a) _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for a check in the proper amount pursuant to this Article IV. 

  

 (b) _Paying Agent_. From time to time following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent appointed by Parent and approved in advance by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock, cash for the prompt payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange for shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Common Shares), deliverable upon due surrender of the Certificates, pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

  

 (c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificate multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such shares of Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holders of shares of Common Stock (other than Excluded Common Shares) who have not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) the Merger Consideration, upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the applicable Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) of the number of shares of Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate being surrendered. Any affidavit of loss presented pursuant to this Article IV, to be deemed effective, must be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 4.3. _Dissenters  Rights_. Any Person who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall not be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Common Stock owned by such Person unless and until such Person shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to shares of Common Stock owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 

  

 4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of shares of Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or 

   ##### 

  

    

distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. 

  

 4.5. _Treatment of Company Options and Warrants_. 

  

 (a) Effective as of the Effective Time each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a " _Company Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time, whether then vested or unvested, in exchange for the right to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to (i) the Merger Consideration, less the per-share exercise price of such option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option. Such cash payment shall be made to the holder of such option as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. For purposes of clarity, no cash payment will be made with respect to any Company Stock Option so cancelled with a per-share exercise price that equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (b) The Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all holders of the Companys outstanding warrants (the " _Warrants_ ") to fully exercise such Warrants prior to the Effective Time. Parent and Company agree to take all actions necessary to comply with the provisions of each of the Companys Warrants in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, including, without limitation, Parent taking any necessary actions or executing any necessary instruments to assume the Companys obligations thereunder, issuing to the holder a new warrant consistent with the provisions of the Warrant as in effect immediately before the Effective Time or making a cash payment consistent with the provisions of the Warrant as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, as applicable. 

  

 4.6. _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Purchase Rights or Warrants, as applicable, such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Purchase Rights or Warrants, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by such party. 

  

ARTICLE V 

   

Representations and Warranties of the Company

hereof (it being understood that any matter disclosed in the reports shall be
deemed to be disclosed for all purposes of this Agreement and the Company
Disclosure Schedule, as long as the relevance of such disclosure is
readily apparent) and the applicable section of the disclosure schedule
delivered by the Company to Parent on the date hereof (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being understood that any matter disclosed
pursuant to any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed to be disclosed for any other section or subsection so long as the
applicability to such other section or subsection is readily apparent from
the face of such disclosure), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

True, correct and complete copies of the following documents, with respect to each Benefit Plan, have been delivered or made available to Parent (in each case, if any): (i) current, accurate and complete copies of all documents embodying or relating to each Benefit Plan, including all amendments thereto, and trust agreements with respect thereto; (ii) the two (2) most recent annual actuarial valuations, if any, prepared for each Benefit Plan; (iii) the two (2) most recent annual reports (Series 5500 and all schedules thereto), if any, required under ERISA in connection with each Benefit Plan or related trust; (iv) the most recent determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "), if any, for each Benefit Plan and related trust which is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code; (v) if the Benefit Plan is funded, the most recent annual and periodic accounting of Benefit Plan assets; (vi) the most recent summary plan description together with the most recent summary of material modifications, if any, required under ERISA with respect to each Benefit Plan; and (vi) all 

   ##### 

  

    

material communications to any employee or participant or employees or
participants relating to each Benefit Plan that will be required to
be described in a summary of material modifications. 

  

 (b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has adopted or announced any plan or commitment (other than any plan or commitment that has already been completed) to establish any new material Benefit Plan, or to modify or to terminate any Benefit Plan (except to the extent required by law or to conform any such Benefit Plan to the requirements of any applicable law, in each case in a manner that would not have the effect of materially increasing benefits thereunder, or as required or contemplated by this Agreement), nor has any intention to do any of the foregoing been communicated to any Company directors, consultants, independent contractors or employees. 

  

 (c) No Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA, and no circumstances exist that could result in liability to the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or an ERISA Affiliate under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA, except for such liability as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material. At no time during the last six years has the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates contributed to or been required to contribute to, or incurred any withdrawal liability (within the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA) to any Benefit Plan that is "multi-employer plan" within the meaning of Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. The term " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means any Person that is considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company maintains, is or will be required to provide, medical or other welfare benefits to employees, directors, former employees, former directors or retirees after their termination of employment or service, other than pursuant to applicable Law or benefits in the nature of severance pay with respect to one or more of the employment contracts set forth on  _Section 5.13_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 (e) All Benefit Plans were established and have been maintained and administered in all material respects in accordance with their terms and in accordance with all applicable Laws. No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in any material liability. No action or failure to act and no transaction or holding of any asset by, or with respect to, any Benefit Plan has or, to the Knowledge of the Company or any Subsidiary, reasonably would subject the Company, Parent, any Subsidiary of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate or any fiduciary to any material tax, penalty or other liability, whether by way of indemnity or otherwise. No event or transaction has occurred with respect to any Benefit Plan that would result in the imposition of any material tax under Chapter 43 of Subtitle D of the Code. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims against the Benefit Plans, any related trusts, any Benefit Plan sponsor or plan administrator, or any fiduciary of the Benefit Plans with respect to the operation of such plans (other than routine benefit claims), except for such claims as have not been individually or in the aggregate, and would not reasonably be expected to be, material. Except as would not, 

   ##### 

  

    

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material, all
Benefit Plans subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United
States (i) if they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment meet all
requirements for such treatment and (ii) if they are intended to be funded
and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate,

To the Knowledge of the Company, all Benefit Plans are, and have been maintained, to the extent applicable, in "good faith compliance" with Section 409A of the Code (within the meaning of the preambles to the proposed regulations thereunder). Each Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued in accordance with its terms (as in effect on the date hereof) without material liability to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. 

  

 (g) Except for (i) any acceleration of vesting specifically provided for or contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any provision of a Benefit Plan disclosed in _Section 5.13_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (iii) the adoption of the severance plan described in _Section 7.8_ , neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with another event, such as a termination of employment) will (i) result in any payment becoming due to any current or former director or current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Benefit Plan or otherwise; (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan; or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits. 

  

 (h) There is no outstanding order against the Benefit Plans that is, and would reasonably be expected to be, material. 

  

 (i) There is no commitment covering any employee that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to give rise to the payment of any amount that would result in a material loss of tax deductions pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code. 

  

 (j) The Company is not obligated, pursuant to any Benefit Plan or otherwise, to grant any options to purchase shares of Company stock to any Employees, consultants or directors of the Company after the date hereof.

Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company (i) is involved in or, to the Knowledge of the Company and its Subsidiaries, threatened with any material labor dispute, grievance, or litigation relating to labor matters involving any Employees, including, without limitation, violation of any federal, state or local labor, safety or employment laws (domestic or foreign), charges of unfair labor practices or discrimination complaints; (ii) has engaged in any unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act; or (iii) is presently, nor has been in the past a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or union contract with respect to Employees and no such agreement or contract is currently being negotiated by the Company.

stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; provided, further that in
the event the Company Board does not make the determination referred to in
clause (iii) of this paragraph but thereafter determines to withdraw, modify,

entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
comparable Benefit Plans (except to the extent such credit would result in a
duplication of accrual of benefits); provided that, notwithstanding the
forgoing, such service shall only be recognized to the extent the service
would be recognized under the New Plan had the service been performed at
the Parent; and _provided further_ that (i) with respect to any pension plan,
such service credit will only be recognized by the Parent for purposes of
vesting and not for purposes of benefit accrual or early retirement
subsidies; and (ii) with respect to retiree health benefits, such service
credit will only be recognized for service performed past the age of forty
(40). In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i)
at the Effective Time, each Affected Employee immediately shall be eligible
to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the
extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a similar
or comparable Company Benefit Plans in which such Affected Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time to the extent permissible
by any applicable insurance carrier or vendor; (ii) with respect to the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, for purposes of each New
Plan providing welfare benefits to any Affected Employee, Parent shall cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions of such New Plan to be waived for such
Affected Employee and his or her covered dependents; and (iii) each
Affected Employee and their eligible dependents shall receive credit for the
plan year in which the Effective Time (or commencement of participation in a
New Plan) occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket
limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time (or the date of
commencement of participation in a New Plan). 

   

 (c) Not later than five business days prior to the Stockholders Meeting, Company shall adopt a severance plan consistent with the terms set forth in Section 7.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule for the benefit of the Affected Employees.

Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with all such indemnification, advancement and exculpation provisions. 

   

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing directors and officers liability insurance (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) covering each Person covered as of the Effective Time by the Companys officers and directors liability insurance policy (each such Person, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one (1) year an amount in excess of 250% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance (such 250% amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ");  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. In addition, the Company may and, at Parents request, the Company will, purchase a six (6)-year "tail" prepaid policy prior to the Effective Time on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the existing directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company; provided, that the amount paid by the Company shall not exceed three times the Maximum Annual Premium. If such "tail" prepaid policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the respective obligations thereunder, and all other obligations under this Section 7.9(b) shall terminate. 

   

 (c) If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns 1) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger, or 2) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, that are set forth under this Section 7.9 shall survive, and to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.9. Parent shall be responsible for any breach by the Surviving Company of the provisions of this Section 7.9. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal representatives. 

    ##### 

  

     

 7.10. _Takeover Statutes_.

 7.11. _Rights Plan_. The Company Board shall take all further action (in addition to that referred to in Section 5.23) reasonably requested by Parent in order to render the Rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

foregoing subclauses (i) or (ii) the Company shall pay Parent

Company described in clause (b)(i), (B) on the second business day following
termination by Parent described under clause (b)(i) and (C) upon such fee

subsequently entered into during the twelve-month period following
termination with a Person other than the Person making the Alternative
Transaction at the time of such termination and (2) the consideration per
share of Common Stock to be paid in such Alternative Transaction is less than
the Merger Consideration, then the Termination Fee will be discounted in the
same proportion as the consideration to be paid in the Alternative
Transaction is less than the Merger Consideration. For purposes of this
Section 9.2(b)(iii), the "consideration per share of Common Stock" shall be
determined as follows: (x) if the consideration consists of cash, such amount

securities, such value as the parties shall reasonably agree.
