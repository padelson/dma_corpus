 ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

 

Section 1.01 _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement has not been
terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement (but no later than ten (10)
business days after the date of this Agreement), and subject to the Company
having timely provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 1.01(g)_ and _Section_ __ _ 1.02(b)_, Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer at a
price per share equal to the Offer Price (as adjusted as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 1.01(c)_, if applicable), net to the seller thereof in cash,
without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.01(h)_.

 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of Merger Sub to,
and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only
to the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The
Offer Conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, and
Parent and Merger Sub may waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition at
any time and from time to time, in their sole discretion, other than the
Minimum Tender Condition, which is non-waivable and may not be amended or
modified. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to increase the
Offer Price or to waive or make any other changes in the terms and conditions
of the Offer;  _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise provided in
this Agreement or previously approved by the Company in writing (in its sole
and absolute discretion), Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit
Merger Sub to, (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought
to be purchased in the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iv) amend, modify or waive the
Minimum Tender Condition, or amend, modify or waive clauses (b), (c)(i) or
(c)(ii) of the Offer Conditions, (v) add to the Offer Conditions or amend,
modify or supplement any Offer Condition in any manner that is or would
reasonably be expected to be adverse to the Unaffiliated Stockholders, or
(vi) terminate, accelerate, limit or extend the expiration date of the Offer
in any manner other than in accordance with the terms of _Section_ __ _
1.01(d)_.

 



2

    

(c) _Adjustments to Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, merger,
issuer tender offer, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect
to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to Merger Subs acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company
Common Stock tendered in the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) nothing
in this _Section_ __ _ 1.01_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take
any action with respect to its securities that is otherwise prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement and (ii) share repurchases and grants of equity
compensation solely to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of this
Agreement, shall not result in any adjustment to the Offer Price.

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at 12:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the twentieth (20th)
business day (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under
the Exchange Act) following the commencement of the Offer (such date and time
being the " _Initial Offer Expiration Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
if at the Initial Offer Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied
(other than any Offer Conditions that are by their nature to be satisfied at
the Acceptance Time) or waived (to the extent permitted by this Agreement and
applicable Law), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
extend the Offer for a period of ten (10) business days (or a shorter period
as agreed to by the Parties). Thereafter, if at any then scheduled expiration
of the Offer, any Offer Condition is not satisfied (other than any Offer
Conditions that are by their nature to be satisfied at the Acceptance Time)
or waived (to the extent permitted by this Agreement and applicable Law),
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer on
one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of ten (10) business days
(or a shorter period as agreed to by the Parties); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to so extend the Offer (i) if
any Offer Condition is not capable of being satisfied on or before the
Outside Date or (ii) to a date subsequent to the earlier of (A) the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.01_ or (B)
the Outside Date (the earlier of which, the " _Extension Deadline_ ").
Notwithstanding anything in the immediately preceding sentences of this
_Section_ __ _ 1.01(d)_ to the contrary, if at any then scheduled expiration
of the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender
Condition and any Offer Conditions that are by their nature to be satisfied at
the Acceptance Time) have been satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by
this Agreement and applicable Law) and the Minimum Tender Condition has not
been satisfied, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the
Offer for more than two (2) additional consecutive increments of ten (10)
business days (or such shorter periods as agreed to by the Parties);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
required to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline. In addition,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer on
one or more occasions for the minimum period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof or the Nasdaq Global Select
Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer. In no
event shall Parent or Merger Sub be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the
Extension Deadline without the prior consent of the Company.

 



3

    

(e) _Payment_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer
and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to (if
each Offer Condition shall have been satisfied (other than any Offer
Conditions that are by their nature to be satisfied at the Acceptance
Time) or waived (to the extent permitted by this Agreement and applicable
Law)), irrevocably accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within three (3) business days)
after the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.01(d)_) and in any event in compliance with
Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The acceptance for payment
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the conditions of
the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ," the
date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the
" _Offer Closing Date_ ," and the time at which the Offer Closing occurs on
the Offer Closing Date is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Acceptance
Time_."

(f) _Termination of the Offer_. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.01_
shall be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right
of any Party to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01_. If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, then Merger
Sub shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) business day of such
termination) irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, Merger Sub
shall not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and
shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of
Merger Sub to return, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the
registered holders thereof to the extent required by the terms of the Offer.

 

(g) _Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent
and Merger Sub shall, in a manner that complies in all material respects with
applicable Law, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "), which shall include, contain or incorporate
by reference an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal, a
summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents pursuant to which
the Offer will be made and any information required by Rule 13e-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act (such Schedule TO and the documents attached as
exhibits thereto, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ ") and promptly thereafter shall cause the Offer Documents
to be disseminated to the holders of the Company Common Stock as, and to the
extent, required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to
Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company that may be
required by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub for
inclusion in the Offer Documents. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion
in the Offer Documents of the Board Actions and the Recommendation of the
board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ", which for purposes
of this _Section_ __ _ 1.01_, _Article VI_ and _Article VII_ , shall mean the
disinterested members of the Company Board), including as contained in the
Schedule 14D-9 and the

 



4

    

 Schedule 13E-3. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent and
Merger Sub shall take all reasonable steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated
to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case, to the extent required
by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify, and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours, the Company upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Offer Documents, and
shall provide the Company with copies of all written correspondence between
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, relating to the Offer.
Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff
of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the formulation of, and provide comments to (which Parent
shall consider in good faith), any written response to any such written
comments of the SEC or its staff. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the
holders of Company Common Stock, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the
Company a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on any such
document and Parent shall consider such comments in good faith.

 

(h) _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of Merger Sub, Parent and the Paying Agent (and any Affiliate
thereof and any other withholding agent) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any other provision of Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

Section 1.02 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. On the date the Offer Documents are first filed
with the SEC, the Company shall, in a manner that complies in all material
respects with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC
a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_"), which shall reflect the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, describe and make the Recommendation with respect to the Offer,
describe the other Board Actions, and include the notice of appraisal rights
in the Merger to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock required by
Section 262 of the DGCL and the Fairness Opinions in their entirety (including
a description of each Fairness Opinion and the financial analysis relating
thereto), and promptly thereafter shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
disseminated to the holders of the Company Common Stock, in each case, to the
extent required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall

 



5

    

 promptly furnish to the Company in writing all information concerning Parent
and Merger Sub that may be required by applicable Law or reasonably requested
by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Law. The Company shall take all reasonable steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the
SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each
case, to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly
notify, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, Parent and Merger Sub
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any
request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide Parent and Merger Sub with copies of
all written correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9, and the Company shall provide Parent and Merger Sub and
their respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
formulation of, and provide comments to (which the Company shall consider in
good faith), any response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff. Prior
to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or supplement thereto)
or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock, the
Company shall provide Parent and Merger Sub a reasonable opportunity to review
and to propose comments on such document and the Company shall consider such
comments in good faith. Notwithstanding any of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 1.02(a)_, this _Section_ __ _ 1.02(a)_ shall not
apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made by the
Company with respect to or in connection with a Takeover Proposal or the
matters addressed in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_.

 

(b) _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the

ARTICLE III 

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

 

Section 3.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any shares
of capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is directly owned by Parent or Merger Sub at such time (including all
shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer,
whether or not such shares are registered in the name of Merger Sub or any of
its Affiliates as of the Effective Time) or held in the treasury of the
Company or owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.01(b)_ and
Dissenting Shares which shall be treated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
3.01(d)_) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding Tax in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.03(h)_ (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of (i) a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ "), or
(ii) a non-certificated share of Company Common Stock evidenced in book-entry
form that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.01(b)_ and Dissenting Shares
which shall be treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.01(d)_) shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration.

 



9

    

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held
by a person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who is entitled to appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and has complied with all the provisions
of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of shares of Company Common Stock
to require appraisal of such shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described in
_Section_ __ _ 3.01(c)_, but shall become the right to receive the fair value
of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws such
Dissenting Stockholders demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise
loses such Dissenting Stockholders right of appraisal with respect to such
shares of Company Common Stock, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, such shares
of Company Common Stock shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares and shall be
deemed to be automatically converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common
Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.01(c)_. The Company shall give
Parent prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Company
Common Stock received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served on the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.
Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to direct and participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, and the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, take any
action with respect to any such demands (including making any payment with
respect to, or settling or offering to settle, any such demands).

 

Section 3.02 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, if there shall be any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), cash
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to Company Common
Stock (or any securities convertible or exchangeable into, or exercisable for,
shares of Company Common Stock) occurring on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the Offer Price, the Merger
Consideration and any other applicable amounts payable under this Agreement
shall be equitably adjusted by Parent to reflect the effect thereof; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.03 _Exchange Fund_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall appoint
(pursuant to an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company) the Companys
transfer agent or another agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") as paying agent for the Unaffiliated Stockholders in
connection with the Offer and the Merger. At or prior to the Acceptance Time,
Merger Sub shall deposit, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to deposit, with
the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Offer Price
and Merger Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement
(such

 



10

    

 cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose and, in the event that the
Exchange Fund shall at any time be insufficient to make the payments of the
aggregate Offer Price and Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly
deposit additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount sufficient to
make all such payments.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in no event more than three (3) business days
thereafter), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or a Book-
Entry Share (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify with respect to
any Certificates that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.03(g)_) to the Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form
(including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agents message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares)), and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 3.03(g)_) or Book-Entry Share, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor from or on behalf of
Parent, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay the amount of cash
which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have been converted into the right
to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01(c)_ (less any required Tax
withholdings pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.03(h)_), and the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be canceled as promptly as reasonably
practicable. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other
similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to
a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Parent shall bear any other transfer Taxes.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 3.03(b)_, each
Certificate and/or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to this _Article III_
, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares. No interest
shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.
The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article
III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of

 



11

    

 Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except
as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. At the close
of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall
be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this
_Article III_.

 

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of the shares of Company Common
Stock on the date that is twelve (12) months after the date on which the
Effective Time occurs shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation (or its
designee), upon demand, and any holders of the shares of Company Common Stock
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving Corporation
shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in
compliance with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have
been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration
would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority,
any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
in the Exchange Fund as directed by Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A 1 or P 1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding five billion dollars ($5,000,000,000) (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available).
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
to Merger Sub or Parent, as Merger Sub directs. Nothing contained herein and
no investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall
diminish or affect the rights (to be paid or otherwise) of any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to receive the Merger Consideration, in each
case as provided herein. To the extent of any such loss, Parent shall fund
additional cash amounts to enable such payments to be made.

 



12

    

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Merger Sub, the providing of an indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation (and, if any
withholding applicable to payments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04_ is made
through a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, any such Subsidiary) and
the Paying Agent (and any Affiliate thereof or any other withholding agent)
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock (or any holder of a Company Stock Option or Company RSU) such amounts
as Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation (and, if any withholding
applicable to payments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04_ is made through a
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, any such Subsidiary), Parent or the
Paying Agent (or such Affiliate thereof or other such withholding agent) are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

Section 3.04 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time:

 

(i) each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest in full and will terminate
and will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment, less any
required withholding as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.03(h)_, equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject
to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the per share exercise price of
such Company Stock Option;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the exercise
price is greater than or equal to the Offer Price, the Company Stock Option
shall be terminated and cancelled for no payment as provided under the Company
Equity Plans;

 

(ii) each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will vest in full (which, for the Company PSUs, shall assume
that all performance vesting conditions have been met) and will terminate and
will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment, less any required
withholding as contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 3.03(h)_, equal to (i) the
Offer Price multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company RSU; and

 

(iii) all Company Equity Plans shall be terminated.

 



13

    

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in any event, not later than
the later of (i) five (5) business days following the Effective Time) and (ii)
the end of the first complete payroll period of the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay to the
holders of Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, as applicable, through its
payroll systems, any amounts due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.04_.

 

Section 3.05 _Company ESPP_. The Company Board shall take such action as
may be necessary under the Company ESPP to (a) terminate all offering periods
under the Company ESPP as of no later than the earlier of (i) the date that is
seven (7) days prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the forty-fifth
(45th) day following the date hereof (such date of termination of all
offering periods being the " _Final Exercise Date_ "), (b) provide that no
further offering periods shall commence under the ESPP on or following the
Final Exercise Date, and (c) terminate the Company ESPP as of the Effective
Time, subject to the Closing. Each outstanding right under the Company ESPP on
the Final Exercise Date shall be exercised on such date for the purchase of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP and any
outstanding Company Common Stock obtained through the exercise of such
outstanding right shall be treated as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.01_,
_Section_ __ _ 3.02_ and  _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ of this Agreement. The
Company shall provide timely notice of the setting of the Final Exercise Date
and termination of the Company ESPP in accordance with the terms of the
Company ESPP.

enforceability of any of the material Company Owned Intellectual Property, in
each case (of clauses (i) and (ii)) that would, individually or in the

Property has been or is the subject (x) to any pending, or to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened, interference, opposition, post-grant review, reissue,
reexamination, invalidity, annulment, cancellation, or other similar
proceeding, in which the scope, validity, enforceability, or ownership of such
Company Registered Intellectual Property is being or has been contested or
challenged or (y) otherwise subject to any order, judgment, injunction,
ruling, decision, award, decree or settlement restricting on the Companys or
any of its Subsidiaries ownership, enforcement, exploitation or other use
thereof. Neither the Companys nor any of its Subsidiaries use of any

Section 6.02 _Solicitation; Takeover Proposals; Change of
Recommendation_.

(a) _No Solicitation_. From the date of this Agreement until the

_Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective Representatives to, (A) upon and following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, immediately cease and cause to be

this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may
participate in discussions for the purpose of seeking to clarify and
understand any terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal solely to
determine whether such inquiry or proposal constitutes a _bona fide_ Takeover
Proposal.

(b) _Certain Definitions_.

 

(i) The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, offer or proposal,
including any amendment or modification to any existing offer or proposal,
whether

 



48

    

 or not in writing (other than, in each case, an offer or proposal made or
submitted by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub), relating to any
transaction (including any single- or multi-step transaction) or series of
related transactions, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, with a person or group relating to (A) any acquisition or
exclusive license of any Key Products or any other license granting
commercialization rights with respect to a Key Product, (B) any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of a business of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (including pursuant to a partnership or joint venture) that
constitutes or generates greater than fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
net revenues or net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, (C) the issuance to such person or group or acquisition by
such person or group of greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the equity
interests in the Company or (D) the sale, lease, license or other transfer to
such person or group of greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis pursuant to a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, reorganization, recapitalization,
partnership, joint venture, consolidation or other business combination, sale
of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer, exchange offer
or other transaction.

(ii) Wherever the term " _group_ " is used in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.02_,
it is used as defined in Rule 13d-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

(iii) The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ , written
Takeover Proposal for the acquisition of no less than a majority of the
outstanding capital stock of the Company or the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis that did not result from a breach of
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, which the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) (A)
is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, and (B)
if consummated, would be more favorable to the Unaffiliated Stockholders from
a financial point of view than the Offer and the Merger, in each case taking
into account all financial, legal, financing, regulatory and other aspects of
such Takeover Proposal (including the person or group making the Takeover
Proposal) and of this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.02(h)_).

 

(iv) The term " _Intervening Event_ " means a change, event, occurrence or
fact that materially affects the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole (other than any change, event, occurrence or fact resulting from a
material breach of this Agreement by the Company) that was not known by the
Company Board (or if known, the consequences of which were not reasonably
foreseeable to the Company Board) as of the date of this Agreement, which
change, event, occurrence or fact becomes known to the Company Board prior to
the Acceptance Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
following constitute or give rise to an Intervening Event: (A) any Takeover
Proposal; (B) any change in applicable Law, regulation or GAAP which is
proposed, approved or enacted after the date of this Agreement; or (C) the
fact, in and of itself, that the Company exceeds internal or published
projections.

 



49

    

(c) _Response to Takeover Proposals_ _. _ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_, if at any time following the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Acceptance Time the Company receives a
_bona fide_ , written Takeover Proposal from a Third Party made after the
date hereof that did not result from a material breach of _Section_ __ _
6.02_ _(a)_ and the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal and the failure to take the following actions would be inconsistent
with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the
Company may (i) enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the
person making such Takeover Proposal and, after entering into such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, furnish information with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to such person pursuant to such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
provide to Parent, as soon as reasonably practicable (and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours) after being provided to such person, any non-
public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries to which such
person is provided such access and which was not previously provided to
Parent, and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such person and
such persons Representatives regarding such Takeover Proposal.

 

(d) _Notice to Parent of Takeover Proposals_ _._ The Company shall
promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent

Representatives receives any Takeover Proposal, and in connection with such
notice, provide the identity of the person or group making such Takeover
Proposal and un-redacted copies of any written Takeover Proposals (and any
documents related thereto), and a written summary of all material oral terms
and conditions, and thereafter the Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a prompt basis (and, in any event, twenty-four (24) hours) of any
material changes to the status or terms of any such Takeover Proposal
(including providing unredacted copies of all written Takeover Proposals and
written summaries of all material oral terms and conditions related to any
Takeover Proposal contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_).

 

(e) _Prohibited Activities_ _._ Neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) (A) withhold, withdraw or rescind (or modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw or rescind (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub), the Recommendation or the findings or conclusions of
the Company Board, or fail to include the Recommendation in the Schedule
14D-9, (B) approve, authorize, or recommend the adoption of, or publicly
propose to approve, declare the advisability of or recommend the adoption of,
any Takeover Proposal, (C) fail to recommend against the acceptance of any
tender offer or exchange offer (other than the Offer or any other tender offer
or exchange offer by Parent or Merger Sub) for the Company Common Stock
within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such offer, (D) fail
to publicly reaffirm the Recommendation within five (5) business days after
Parent so requests in writing or (E) publicly propose or announce an
intention to take, or resolve or agree to take, any of the foregoing actions
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, term sheet, merger

 



50

    

 agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement related to, or that is intended to or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, other than
any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement referred to in _Section_ __ _
6.02(c)_ (collectively, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 

(f) _Intervening Event_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement but subject to compliance with _Section_ __ _
6.02(h)_, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may make
an Adverse Recommendation Change (but only with respect to clause (A), clause
(D) and clause (E) (solely with respect to clauses (A) and (D)) of the
definition thereof) in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(g) _Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement but subject to compliance with _Section_ __ _
6.02(h)_, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if in response to a _bona
fide_ written Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that
did not result from a breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ _(a)_ and which has not
been withdrawn, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to take any of the
actions in clauses (i) and (ii) below with respect to such Superior Proposal
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, (i) the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change with respect to such Superior Proposal or (ii) the Company may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(f)_ in order to
enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(f)_ unless the Company (A) has complied
with its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.02(h)_, (B) pays, or causes to be
paid, to Parent the Termination Amount payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
9.03(b)_ prior to or concurrently with such termination and (C) immediately
following or concurrently with such termination, enters into a definitive
Acquisition Agreement that documents the terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal.

(h) _Match Right_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company shall not be entitled to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.02(f)_ or _Section_ __ _
6.02(g)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(f)_
unless (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent four (4) business days
prior written notice (the " _Match Right Notice_ "), advising Parent that the
Company intends to take such action and specifying, in reasonable detail, the
reasons for such action and (1) with respect to a Superior Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (and disclosing
the identity of the person making such Superior Proposal and providing copies
of the most current versions of any proposed agreements relating thereto) or
(2) with respect to an Intervening Event, the details of such Intervening
Event, and (y):

 

(i) during such four (4) business day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company and its Representatives shall have engaged in good faith negotiations

 



51

    

 with Parent regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent or another proposal to the extent proposed by Parent so that an Adverse
Recommendation Change would no longer be necessary or to cause such Takeover
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, as applicable; and

 

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to this
Agreement (including to the price terms hereof) and any other agreements or
proposals that may be proposed in writing by Parent (the " _Proposed Changed
Terms_ ") no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th)
business day of such four (4) business day period and shall have determined
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that, after giving effect to such Proposed Changed Terms, the
failure to make the Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(f)_, as applicable, would be inconsistent
with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of any (x) material changes in the
changes, effects, events, occurrences or facts relating to an
Intervening Event and (y) changes to the financial terms, or material
revisions to the other terms, of a Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in
each case, deliver to Parent a new Match Right Notice consistent with that
described in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(h)_ and a new two (2) business day
notice period under _Section_ __ _ 6.02(h)(i)_ shall commence (but in no
event shall such new notice period be shorter than the initial four (4)
business day notice period).

(i) _Communications With Stockholders_. Nothing contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.02_ shall prohibit the Company from (i) complying with Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith determination of the
Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, failure to
do so would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or (iii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 14d_ _-9(f)_
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
stockholders of the Company) in which the Company indicates that it has not
changed the Recommendation; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.02(i)_ shall be deemed to permit the Company to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change except in compliance with _Section_ __ _
6.02(f)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(g)_, as applicable.

ARTICLE VII

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 Section 7.01 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to, afford to Parent and its Representatives,
reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement to all of
its and its Subsidiaries properties, books and records (including Tax
Returns) and upon reasonable notice by Parent to those employees and
Representatives of the Company to whom Parent requests access, and, during
such period, the Company shall furnish to Parent, as promptly as reasonably
practicable and upon reasonable notice, all financial, operating and other
data and information concerning its and its

 



52

    

 Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as Parent through its
Representatives may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access
to or disclose information where the Company reasonably determines that such
access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or conflict with or violate any Law
(including antitrust Laws) or any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall in
such event use reasonable best efforts to avoid such constraints
on disclosure, including entering into a joint defense agreement in customary
form). No investigation or access permitted, or knowledge obtained, pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company
hereunder or otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of Parent
or Merger Sub hereunder.

Litigation_. 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the Parties agrees that it and its Affiliates will use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) obtain all necessary consents,
approvals, orders, waivers and authorizations of, and actions or nonactions
by, any Governmental Authority or any Third Party, and make all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings with, and notices to, any Governmental
Authorities (including pursuant to the HSR Act and each Non-U.S. Merger
Control Law), and take all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid a
suit, action, proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and
its Affiliates shall not be required to effect or undertake (or be required to
agree or consent to), and, without the prior written consent of Parent, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not effect to undertake (or be required to
agree or consent to) any sale, license, divestiture or disposition or holding
separate of, or any other structural, behavioral or conduct remedy with
respect to, or any other action that alters or restricts in any way the
conduct or operation of (in each case, whether before or after the Acceptance
Time or the Effective Time) any assets, businesses, divisions, operations,
products or product lines, commercial practices, Intellectual Property
rights, relationships, contractual rights, obligations or arrangements of
Parent or the Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates).

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party
agrees to (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and in
any event no later than ten (10) business days after the date of this
Agreement and make any filings as may be required under any Non-U.S. Merger
Control Law as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, (ii)

53

pursuant to the HSR Act or any Non-U.S. Merger Control Law, and (iii) use its
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods, or
receipt of required authorizations, as applicable, under the HSR Act and any
Non-U.S. Merger Control Law as promptly as practicable. 

(d) Subject to applicable Laws, redaction where necessary, and the
instructions of any Governmental Authority, the Company and Parent each shall
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry
by or before a Governmental Authority relating thereto and (ii) keep the other
apprised on a reasonably timely basis of any material communications, and
provide copies thereof in the case of any such written communications,
received by Parent or any of its Representatives, or the Company or any of its
Representatives, as the case may be, from any Third Party or any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Neither the Company nor Parent shall participate in any
substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any submissions, filings, investigation (including
any settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry relating to
the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting, telephone call or
discussion. Subject to reasonable limitations limiting access to outside
counsel, the Company and Parent each shall, consult with the other regarding
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any Third Party or any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries be
obligated to litigate or participate in the litigation of any Transaction
Litigation brought by a Governmental Authority challenging or seeking to
restrain, make illegal, prohibit or place conditions on the consummation of
the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have the right, in its discretion,
to litigate or participate in (subject to a customary joint defense
agreement), but not control, the litigation of any such Transaction
Litigation. Each Party shall promptly advise the other Party orally and in
writing of any developments (other than immaterial developments) regarding,
and the Parties shall cooperate fully with each other in connection with, and
shall consult with and permit and the other Party and its Representatives to
participate in, the defense, negotiation or settlement of any Transaction
Litigation. The Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
Parents advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation. The Company shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its or their 

 



54

    

 Representatives to settle or agree to a settlement arrangement regarding any
Transaction Litigation unless Parent shall otherwise consent in writing, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. "
_Transaction Litigation_ " means any Litigation commenced or threatened
against any Party or any of its Affiliates by any Governmental Authority or
any private party, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 7.03 _State Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute becomes or

or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before the Merger Closing and who
continues employment with Subsidiaries of Parent immediately following the

wage rate that is at least equal to the base salary or wage rate provided by

Employees participate following the Merger Closing, to the extent that such
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would not apply in the absence of
such change under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in effect immediately
prior to the Merger Closing, and (ii) the crediting of each Company Employee
(or his or her eligible, covered dependents) with any co-payments and
deductibles paid under a group health benefit plan prior to any such change in

change to the extent that such amounts were satisfied or did not apply under
the analogous Company Benefit Plan in effect immediately prior to the Merger
Closing.

applicable Subsidiaries to, honor all of the Company Benefit Plans set forth
on _Section_ __ _ 7.04(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, in accordance
with their terms.

Equity Incentive Award Plan, if applicable (the " _Equity Plan Bonus
Component_ ")), whether determined on an individual or an aggregate basis,
with respect to which the performance period is the 2020 calendar year,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its applicable
Subsidiaries to, pay bonuses to all Company Employees who are eligible to
receive such bonus or award, as determined based on the terms of the Bonus

with such bonuses to be paid at such times required under the terms of the

determination of the amount of the bonuses payable pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be made after consultation with the individual serving in the
most senior executive position with the Surviving Corporation after the
Closing who was also a member of the Executive Committee of the management
team of the Company immediately prior to the Closing, and the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the assessment of the Companys performance during
the portion of 2020 following the Closing, and of the other elements

good faith and with due regard for strong performance during the portion of
2020 following the Closing.

(f) _Severance_. Without limiting the scope of  _Section_ __ _ 7.04(a)_,
during the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its applicable Subsidiaries to, provide to any Company Employee
whose employment is involuntarily terminated without cause by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or their applicable Subsidiaries after the Closing, with
severance payments in an amount set forth on _Section_ __ _ 7.04(f)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter or such Continuing Employees contractual

(and does not revoke) a valid waiver and release of all claims against Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or their applicable Subsidiaries in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

(g) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ are included for the sole

Section 7.05 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to purchase a "tail" or "runoff" directors and officers liability
insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering each such person covered as of the date of this
Agreement by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
policy and each person who becomes covered by the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance policy prior to the Effective Time on terms with
respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than those of
such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement for the six (6) year
period following the Effective Time and at an aggregate price not to exceed
300% of the aggregate amount per annum the Company paid in its last full
fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement, which amount is set forth on

Effective Time, then either (i) Parent may purchase such "tail" or
"runoff" policy on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or (ii)
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy

covering each such person currently covered by the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and
amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect as of the date
of this Agreement for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time;
_provided further_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this _Section_ __
_ 7.05(a)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated
to pay annual premiums in an aggregate amount in excess of 300% of the Current
Premium and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 300%
of the Current Premium, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be maintained policies of insurance that, in Parent or the Surviving
Corporations good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual aggregate premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium.

(b) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, fulfill, perform and satisfy
the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the extent permitted
and enforceable under applicable Law, under (i) each indemnification agreement
in effect between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any individual

a director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each,
an " _Indemnified Party_ ") made available to Parent prior to the date
hereof, and (ii) any indemnification provision and any exculpation provision
set forth in the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws as in effect on the

and Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect

Indemnified Party than are set forth in the Company Charter or the Company
Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
the Company, by Contract or otherwise.

Section 9.03 _Payment of Termination Amount_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _

same-day funds within two (2) business days following the date of such

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.01(f)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the
Termination Amount by wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent)
of same-day funds, concurrently with, and as a condition to the effectiveness

(c) If (i) any person shall have publicly disclosed or otherwise

agreements contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.03_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in an award against the Company for such
amount, the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) Parents and Merger
Subs costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the applicable amount
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment

on the date such payment was required to be made. In no event shall the
Company be required to pay any Termination Amount on more than one occasion.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Parent (or its
designee) receives the Termination Amount from the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.03_, then, except as provided in the proviso of  _Section_
__ _ 9.02_, any such payment shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy
of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of

equity holders, managers, members or Affiliates, and none of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or Affiliates
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

payable under _Section_ __ _ 9.03(d)_, shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and Merger Sub in the event of termination of this Agreement
under circumstances requiring the payment of a Termination Amount pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.03(b)_ or _Section_ __ _
9.03(c)_. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Parent shall receive the
Termination Amount (and, to the extent applicable, any amounts payable under
_Section_ __ _ 9.03(d)_), the receipt thereof shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and the termination
thereof or any matter forming the basis for such termination), including the
Merger, and in such case neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
or Representatives shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Litigation or
make any claim against the Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any of the transactions

Section 11.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement. The restrictions on disclosure in the Confidentiality Agreement
with respect to information required to be included in any filings or
documents furnished to the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall terminate immediately
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 Section 11.05 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for (a) the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.05_, and (b) the rights, at and after the
Effective Time, of the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock and

neither this Agreement nor any other agreement contemplated hereby
are intended to or shall confer upon any person other than the Parties hereto
and thereto any legal or equitable rights or remedies. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties
and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.06_ without notice or liability to any other
person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters.

 Section 11.06 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, and any assignment without such
consent shall be null and void. No assignment by any Party shall relieve such
Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the immediately
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

 

Section 11.07 _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY LITIGATION (WHETHER
AT LAW, IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT) RELATING TO ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR
PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
ANY LAWS THAT WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE TO APPLY.

 

Section 11.08 _Jurisdiction; Service of Process_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and
any appellate court thereof) or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks
jurisdiction, the federal court of the United States sitting in the State of
Delaware (and any appellate court thereof) for the

 



76

    

 purpose of any Litigation directly or indirectly based upon, relating to
arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, and each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such action or
proceeding shall be brought in, and may be heard and determined, exclusively
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and any appellate court
thereof) or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks jurisdiction, the
federal court of the United States sitting in the State of Delaware (and any
appellate court thereof). Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue in, and any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any action or proceeding
so brought. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the service of the summons
and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of
itself or its property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such
Party at the addresses set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 11.03_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, service of process
must be delivered to the registered agent in Delaware of Nestle USA, Inc.

 

Section 11.09 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON, RELATING
TO, ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER,
(C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION_ __ _ 11.09_.

Section 11.10 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy therefor and therefore fully intend for specific
performance to be an available remedy for breaches of this Agreement. It is
accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 9.01,_ and that in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other
hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce 

 



77

    

 specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in
any court referred to in _Section_ __ _ 11.08_, without proof of actual
damages, this being in addition to any other remedy to which each Party is
entitled at Law or in equity. The Parties further agree not to object to a
remedy of specific performance on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. Each Party further
acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _
11.10_ are an integral part of the Merger, the Offer and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

 

Section 11.11 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as none of the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to attempt to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law in a mutually acceptable manner.

 

Section 11.12 _Counterparts; Facsimile and Electronic Signatures_.
This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the
different Parties hereto in separate counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to
the other Parties. This Agreement or any counterpart may be executed and
delivered by facsimile copies or delivered and exchanged by electronic
communications by portable document format (.pdf), including DocuSign, each
of which shall be deemed an original, and the exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic
delivery in portable document format (.pdf) shall be sufficient to bind
the Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger
Sub to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act
(relating to Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of
Company Common Stock promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the
Offer), pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the
Offer if: (a) there shall have not been validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of shares of
Company Common Stock which, when added, without duplication, to the shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its wholly owned Subsidiaries, would
represent at least a majority of the Fully Diluted Shares as of the
expiration of the Offer (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ "); (b) the waiting
period applicable to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act (or any
extension thereof) shall have neither expired nor terminated; or (c) any of
the following conditions shall have occurred:

 

(i) there shall be any Restraint in the United States or Germany in effect
restraining, enjoining, making illegal, or otherwise preventing or
prohibiting the making of the Offer or the consummation of the Merger or the
Offer as of the expiration of the Offer;

 

(ii) the approvals required under any Non-U.S. Merger Control Law in
Germany shall not have been obtained at or prior to the expiration of the
Offer;

(iii) (A) any of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 4.01_
(Organization, Standing and Corporate Power), _Section_ __ _ 4.03(a)_
(Capital Structure), _Section_ __ _ 4.04_ (Authority; Recommendation),
_Section_ __ _ 4.07(ii)_ (Absence of Certain Changes), and  _Section_ __ _
4.24_ (Brokers and Other Advisors)) shall not be true and correct except for
any failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that for this purpose all
references to the term "Material Adverse Effect" and other qualifications
based on the word "material," set forth in any such representations and
warranties shall be disregarded); (B) the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.04_ (Authority; Recommendation),
_Section_ __ _ 4.24_ (Brokers and Other Advisors) and in the first sentence
of _Section_ __ _ 4.01_ (Organization, Standing and Corporate Power) shall
not be true and correct in all material respects; and (C) the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.03(a)_ (Capital
Structure) shall not be true and correct except for _de minimis_ inaccuracies
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
cause the aggregate amounts to be paid by Parent in connection with this
Agreement to increase by more than $2,000,000; and (D) clause (ii) of the
representation and warranty of the Company set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.07_
(Absence of Certain Changes) shall not be true and correct in all respects in
the case of each of clause (A), (B), (C) and (D), as of the date of this
Agreement and as of consummation of the Offer as though made at such time
(except to the extent expressly made as of a specific date, in which case as
of such specific date);

 



Annex I-1

    

(iv) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with its obligations required to be performed or complied with by it
under this Agreement at or prior to the expiration of the Offer;

 

(v) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred a Material
Adverse Effect;

 

(vi) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate
executed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or the chief
financial officer of the Company certifying that none of the conditions set
forth in clauses (c)(iii), (c)(iv) and (c)(v) above shall have occurred; or

 

(vii) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

 

For purposes of determining whether the Minimum Tender Condition has been
satisfied, Parent and Merger Sub shall exclude for purposes of
its determination thereof shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures that have not actually been "received" (as defined in
Section 251(h)(6)(f) of the DGCL) prior to the expiration of the Offer.

 

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights and obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or
modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, may be waived by Parent and
Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
their sole discretion (other than the Minimum Tender Condition, which may not
be waived). The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

The capitalized terms used in this _Annex I_ and not defined in this _Annex
I_ shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of August 29, 2020, by and among Societes des Produits Nestle S.A.,
SPN MergerSub, Inc. and Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.
