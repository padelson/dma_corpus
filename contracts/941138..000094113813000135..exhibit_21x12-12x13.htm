ARTICLE I THE MERGER

and in accordance with the Arizona Business Corporation Act (the "ABCA"), at
the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a
result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the
Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the ABCA. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the
property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company

liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

the Surviving Corporation to be amended in its entirety to be identical to the
articles of incorporation of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be changed to
"UNS Energy Corporation", until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law, subject to Section 5.10. In addition, at the
Effective Time, the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, except
that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be changed to "UNS Energy
Corporation", until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law, subject to Section 5.10.



(c) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
at the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to
hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly
elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, continue as the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause four (4) members of the
Company Board designated by the Company who are members of the Company Board
as of the Closing and who are acceptable to Parent to be elected to the Board
of Directors of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time; provided,
that at least one (1) such designee shall be the Chief Executive Officer of
the Company.



(d) After the Effective Time, if the Surviving Corporation shall determine or
shall be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance,
assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of either of the Company
or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the
Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of
conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise,

 all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest,
perfect or confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such
property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.



Section 1.2 Closing and Effective Time of Merger. The closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date
to be specified by the parties (the "Closing Date"), such date to be no later
than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Baker Botts
L.L.P., 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10112, unless another time,
date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. On the
Closing Date, or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree to in
writing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause an appropriate

Law) with the Arizona Corporation Commission ("ACC") in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the ABCA and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the ABCA. The Merger shall become effective at the time the
Articles of Merger shall have been duly delivered to the ACC for filing or
such other date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the
Articles of Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the
"Effective Time".



ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK



Section 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub:



(a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.2, each share of
common stock, no par value, of the Company ("Company Common Stock" and each
such share, a "Share" and collectively, the "Shares") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b), shall be converted into the right to receive
in cash, without interest, $60.25 per Share (the "Merger Consideration"). At
the Effective Time, all of the Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "Certificate") formerly
representing any of the Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, subject to compliance with
the procedures for surrender of such Shares as set forth in Section 2.2.



(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Ultimate Parent-Owned Stock. All Shares
that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company
Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

 (c) Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, no par value, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one (1) newly and validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.



(d) Merger Consideration Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon
shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Shares
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event; provided that no such adjustment shall result in any increase or
decrease of the Aggregate Merger Consideration.



Section 2.2 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.



(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a
nationally recognized financial institution designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of
the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to
the Aggregate Merger Consideration (the "Exchange Fund"). Funds made available
to the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by
Parent, in (i) short-term obligations of the United States of America with
maturities of no more than 30 days, (ii) commercial paper obligations rated
A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's,
respectively, or (iii) deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or banker's
acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or
Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks, each of which has
capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $1.0 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then
publicly available at the SEC or otherwise), in each case, pending payment
thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant to this Article
II. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Paying Agent shall, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions, deliver the cash contemplated to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.1 out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. To the extent that there are losses with respect to
such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the
level required to make prompt cash payment of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore
the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so
as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient to promptly make such cash payments.



(b) Procedures for Surrender.



| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Certificates. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (x) a letter of transmittal,
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the 

 Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify after consultation with
the Company; and (y) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a
letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificates, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of Shares formerly represented by such Certificates,
and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.



| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

Book-Entry Shares. Any holder of non-certificated Shares represented by book-
entry ("Book-Entry Shares") whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement, shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed
letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement. In lieu
thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the
Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement shall, upon receipt by the Paying
Agent of an "agent's message" (or such other evidence, if any, of surrender as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request) be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the
number of Shares formerly represented by such Book-Entry Shares. Payment of
the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made
to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and
Merger Consideration may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or shall
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either have been paid
or are not required to be paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration into which the Shares
theretofore represented by such Certificate or such Book-Entry Shares have
been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a). No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any

Certificate or Book-Entry Share.



(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. As of the close of
business on the date of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration
paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon surrender of any
Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein
or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.



(d) Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. At any
time following the day which is nine (9) months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest or other income
received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it) not
disbursed to holders of Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled
to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Shares and
compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.2(b), without interest.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed as of the date that is immediately prior to such time as such Merger
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or similarly become property of any
Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interests of any
Person previously entitled thereto.



(e) Withholding Rights. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective agents (including the Paying Agent), as the case may be,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Options,
Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units or Other Equity-Based Awards, as
applicable, such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective agents (including the Paying Agent) is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Code or any other
provision of applicable Law (including any provision of federal, state, local
or foreign tax law); provided that any transfer or other similar Taxes payable
in connection with the Merger (other than such Taxes required to be paid by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
holder of record of the Shares with respect to which such payment is made)
shall be borne and paid by Parent and Merger Sub. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any agent,
such amounts shall be paid to the applicable Tax authorities and shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Shares, Company Options, Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units or Other
Equity-Based Awards, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or their
applicable agent, as the case may be.

 (f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the portion of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a); provided, however, that
Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



| 
---|--- 

Section 2.3

|

Treatment of Company Options, Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units, Other
Equity-Based Awards and Equity Plans. 

 

(a) Treatment of Company Equity Awards. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt
appropriate resolutions and take all other actions to provide that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time:



| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Treatment of Company Options. Each outstanding option to purchase Shares
(each, a "Company Option") granted pursuant to any equity incentive plan of
the Company, including the Company's 2011 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan,
2006 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan, Amended and Restated 1994 Outside
Director Stock Option Plan and any other plan, agreement or arrangement of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (collectively, the "Company Equity Plans"),
shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be fully vested
and cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such
cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in settlement therefor
and full satisfaction thereof, a payment in cash (subject to any withholding
in accordance with Section 2.2(e)) equal to the product of (i) the total
number of Shares previously subject to such Company Option and (ii) the
amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price
per Share previously subject to such Company Option (such amounts payable
hereunder, the "Option Payments"). In each case, the Option Payment shall be
made within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date. From and after the
Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder
to the payment of the Option Payment. No interest shall be paid or accrued on
any cash payable with respect to any Company Option.

Treatment of Restricted Shares. Each unvested Share subject to forfeiture
restrictions, repurchase rights or other restrictions (each, a "Restricted
Share") granted pursuant to any Company Equity Plan shall, without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, vest in full, and all restrictions
(including forfeiture restrictions or repurchase rights) otherwise applicable
to such Restricted Share shall lapse, and each Restricted Share shall be
converted into the right to receive a payment in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, without interest (subject to any withholding in accordance with
Section 2.2(e)). In each case, payment with respect to any Restricted Shares
shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date.



(iii) Treatment of Restricted Stock Units and Other Equity-Based Awards.

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each contractual right to receive a
Share of Company Common Stock or the value of such a Share other than Company
Options (each, an "Other Equity-Based Award"), including restricted stock
units and performance shares (such restricted stock units and performance
shares collectively, "Restricted Stock Units"), granted pursuant to any
Company Equity Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest in
full, and all restrictions (including forfeiture restrictions or repurchase
rights) otherwise applicable to such Other Equity-Based Award shall lapse, and
each Other Equity-Based Award shall be cancelled and in exchange therefor,
each former holder of any such cancelled Other Equity-Based Award shall be
entitled to receive, in settlement therefor and full satisfaction thereof, a
payment in cash (subject to any withholding in accordance with Section 2.2(e))
equal to the product of (x) the Merger Consideration and (y) the number of
Shares subject to the Other Equity-Based Award as of the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in the case of any Restricted Stock Units subject to
performance-based vesting conditions, the applicable performance criteria
shall be deemed to have been satisfied based on (A) target level of attainment
or (B) actual attainment during the full fiscal quarters of the Company
completed during the applicable performance period prior to the Effective
Time, whichever results in a greater payment, in each case without proration
notwithstanding the early termination (if any) of the applicable performance
period; and provided further, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in calculating the level of attainment of the performance
criteria applicable to Restricted Stock Units subject to performance-based
vesting conditions, the Company (or the Surviving Corporation) shall exclude
any expenses or costs associated with or arising as a result of or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any non-
recurring charges that would not reasonably be expected to have been incurred
had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred. In each
case, payment with respect to any Other Equity-Based Award shall be made
within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date; provided, however, that
in the case of any Other Equity-Based Awards that constitute deferred
compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, payment shall
occur on the date that it would otherwise occur under the applicable award
agreement absent the application of this Section 2.3(a)(iii) to the extent
necessary to avoid the imposition of any penalty or other taxes under Section
409A of the Code. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash payable
with respect to any Other Equity-Based Award.

 (b) Termination of Company Equity Plans. After the Effective Time, all Company
Equity Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options, Restricted
Shares, Restricted Stock Units, Other Equity-Based Awards or other rights with
respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder.



(c) Parent Funding. At the Effective Time, Parent shall make a cash
contribution to the Surviving Corporation in immediately available funds to
permit the Surviving Corporation to make the payments required under this
Section 2.3.

Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or
assets or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except

Joint Venture Entity (collectively, the "Company Joint Venture Securities")

the outcomes of which, if determined adversely to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not

Company and/or TEP with the SEC, as have been supplemented, modified or
amended since the time of filing and including all schedules, exhibits and
other information incorporated by reference therein, collectively, the
"Company SEC Documents"). All of the Company SEC Documents have been timely

with the then applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) have been prepared or, in

date of such Company Financial Statement) applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in
the case of interim financial statements, for normal and recurring year-end
adjustments and as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any
successor or like form under the Exchange Act and that were not or are not
expected to be material in nature) and (iii) fairly present, or, in the case
of Company Financial Statements filed after the date hereof, will fairly

Section 3.8 Internal Control and Disclosure Controls.



(a) The Company has designed and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. The Company (a) has designed and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company and TEP in the reports that they file or submit under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to
the Company's management (including the Company's principal executive and
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions) as
appropriate to allow timely decisions

 regarding required disclosure and (b) based on its most recent evaluation of
internal control prior to the date hereof, has disclosed to the Company's
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting, except with respect to
clause (a), those failures to design or maintain that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of any such
disclosure made by management to Company's auditors and to the audit committee
since December 31, 2010. Since December 31, 2010, to the knowledge of the
Company, no attorney representing the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation, relating to periods after December 31,
2010. Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
with respect to the Company SEC Documents and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate in all material respects as of the date
hereof. There are no "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as
defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) in the design or operation of the Company's
internal controls and procedures which would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data.



(b) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all
comment letters from the staff of the SEC since December 31, 2010 relating to
Company SEC Documents and all written responses of the Company thereto through
the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC
staff with respect to any Company SEC Documents.



(c) There are no SEC inquiries or investigations, other governmental inquiries
or investigations or internal investigations pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in
each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.



Section 3.9 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for those liabilities and
obligations (a) set forth, reserved against or provided for in the audited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2012, or in the
notes thereto, (b) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since December 31, 2012, (c) incurred under this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or
(d) that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has or
is subject to any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether accrued,
absolute, determined, determinable, fixed or contingent, that would be
required to be recorded or reflected on a balance sheet in accordance with
GAAP. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including

 any Contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand), or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act), where the result, purpose or effect of such contract or
arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the
Company Financial Statements or the Company SEC Documents.



Section 3.10 Absence of Certain Changes or Events



(a) Since December 31, 2012, through the date of this Agreement, the business
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has been conducted in the ordinary
course of business and there has not been any Company Material Adverse Effect

(a) List of Plans. Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
a true and complete list of each Company Benefit Plan. "Company Benefit Plan"
shall mean each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and any
other material plan, policy, program, practice, agreement, understanding or
arrangement providing compensation or other benefits to any current or former
director, officer, employee or individual consultant, which are maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or under
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any obligation or liability,
including all incentive, bonus, profit sharing, savings, deferred compensation, cafeteria, "voluntary employees' beneficiary
associations" under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code (each a "VEBA"), medical,
health, dental, life insurance, disability, accident, supplemental
unemployment or retirement, employment, severance or salary or benefits
continuation, fringe benefit, stock purchase or equity based compensation
plans, policies or programs.



(b) General Compliance. Each Company Benefit Plan has been established,
administered, and maintained in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, (i) all contributions required to be made under the
terms of any Company Benefit Plan have been timely made or have been reflected
in the Company Financial Statements, and (ii) all Company Benefit Plans that
are subject to Section 409A of the Code are in compliance with the
requirements of Code Section 409A. Except as required to maintain the tax-
qualified status of any Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code, no condition or circumstance exists that would prevent the
amendment or termination of any Company Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor
any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred, and no event has occurred and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no condition or circumstance exists that would
reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in, any material
unsatisfied liability of the Company under Title IV of ERISA or Sections 412
or 430 of the Code or Sections 302 or 303 of ERISA.



(c) Tax Qualification of Plans. (i) Each Company Benefit Plan which is
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has either received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS covering all applicable Tax law
changes, as to its qualified status or may rely upon an opinion letter for a
prototype plan and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event has
occurred that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan under Section 401(a) of the
Code, (ii) each VEBA has been determined by the IRS to be exempt from U.S.
federal income tax under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, and, to the knowledge
of the Company, no fact or event has occurred that would reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect the tax-exempt status of any such
VEBA, (iii) there has been no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, other than a transaction
that is exempt under a statutory or administrative exemption), with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to the Company, and (iv) no suit, administrative
proceeding, claim, audit, examination, investigation, action or other
litigation is pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, is threatened
against or with respect to any such Company Benefit Plan, including any audit
or inquiry by the IRS or United States Department of Labor (other than routine
benefits claims) that would reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to the Company. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
filed, or is preparing to file, an application under the IRS Employee Plans
Compliance Resolution System or the Department of Labor's Voluntary Fiduciary
Correction Program with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.



(d) Retiree Welfare Benefits. Section 3.12(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter
lists each Company Benefit Plan that provides health or other welfare benefits
after retirement or other termination of employment (other than (i)
continuation coverage required under Section 4980B(f) of the Code or other
similar applicable Law, (ii) coverage or benefits the

 full cost of which is borne by the employee or former employee (or any
beneficiary of the employee or former employee) or (iii) benefits provided
during any applicable severance period).

(e) Single Employer Plans. Section 3.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter
lists each Company Benefit Plan that is a single-employer pension plan subject
to Title IV of ERISA or part 3 of Subtitle A of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code (each, a "Single Employer Plan"). Except as set forth in Section 3.12(e)
of the Company Disclosure Letter or as included in the Company SEC Documents
filed before 5:30 p.m. ET on the Business Day immediately prior to the date
hereof, the actuarial present value of the accumulated plan benefits (whether
or not vested) under the Single Employer Plans as of the close of the most
recent plan year did not exceed the market value of the assets allocable
thereto, and, to the knowledge of the Company, since such date, there has been
no material adverse change in the financial condition of any Single Employer
Plan. With respect to each Single Employer Plan, except as would not have or
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability of the Company, (i)
no reportable event (within the meaning of Section

4043 of ERISA, other than an event for which the reporting requirements have
been waived by regulations) has occurred or is expected to occur, (ii) none of
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has failed to satisfy the minimum
funding standard within the meaning of Sections 412 and 430 of the Code or
Sections 302 and 303 of ERISA, or obtained a waiver of any minimum funding
standard or any amortization period under Section 412 of the Code or Section
302 of ERISA, (iii) neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is required to
provide security under Section 436(f) of the Code, (iv) all premiums (and
interest charges and penalties for late payment, if applicable) have been paid
when due to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC"), (v) no filing
has been made by the Company or any Company Subsidiary with the PBGC to
terminate any Single Employer Plan and no proceeding has been commenced by the
PBGC to terminate, or appoint a trustee under Title IV of ERISA to administer,
any Single Employer Plan and (vi) no liability has been incurred under Section
4062(e) of ERISA.



(f) Multiemployer Plans. None of the Company Benefit Plans is a multiemployer
pension plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA).



(g) Change in Control. Section 3.12(g)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter
lists each Company Benefit Plan that provides for the payment (whether in cash
or property or the vesting of property) as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent event), to any employee, officer or
director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in proposed U.S. Treasury Regulation
Section 1.280G-1) under any Company Benefit Plan that is reasonably expected
to be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code). Except as listed in Section 3.12(g)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
any obligation (current or otherwise) to pay, gross up or otherwise indemnify
any individual for any taxes imposed under Code Section 4999 or 409A. Except
as contemplated by Section 2.3 of this Agreement or as listed in Section
3.12(g)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the execution of this
Agreement, stockholder approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent event) will: (i) entitle any employees of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to severance pay or any increase in severance pay
upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to any of
the Company Benefit Plans, or (iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company
to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans.

with respect to each Company Benefit Plan have been delivered or made

Section 3.13 Labor and Other Employment Matters.



(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is, and since January 1, 2011 has
been, in compliance in all material respects with (i) all applicable Laws
respecting labor, employment, fair employment practices, terms and conditions
of employment, workers' compensation, occupational safety, plant closings, and
wages and hours, and (ii) all collective bargaining agreements. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is engaged in and since January 1, 2011,
has not engaged in any unfair labor practice in any material respect. Section

3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each collective bargaining
agreement covering the terms of employment of any employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary. No labor union or collective bargaining agreement is
currently being negotiated by or involves the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and there is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened demand for recognition or certification and no representation or
certification proceedings or petitions relating to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. There is no ongoing, and to the knowledge of the Company, no
pending or threatened, work stoppage, slowdown, labor strike, material labor
dispute, union organizing efforts or requests for representation against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, and there have been no such actions within
the past three (3) years. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened material grievances or arbitration proceedings arising out
of or under any labor union or collective bargaining agreement, and since
January 1, 2011, none have existed. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has engaged in layoffs or employment terminations sufficient in
number to trigger application of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act or any similar state, local or foreign Law (including, but
not limited to, any state laws relating to plant closings or mass layoffs)
(collectively, "WARN") during the last six (6) years. The Company and each
Company Subsidiary is and has been in compliance with WARN, and the Company
and each Company Subsidiary has not incurred any liability or obligation under
WARN which remains unsatisfied.

Company Disclosure Letter.

Each Contract of the type described in Section 3.14(a) and Section 3.14(b) is
referred to herein as a

"Company Scheduled Contract".



(c) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) each
Company Scheduled Contract is a valid and binding obligation of the Company or
the Company Subsidiary party thereto and, to the knowledge of the Company, of
the other parties thereto, enforceable against the Company or the Company
Subsidiary party thereto and, to the knowledge of the Company, against the
other parties thereto in accordance with its terms, except that (A) such
enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors' rights
generally and (B) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other
forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefore may be brought;
(ii) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have, and to the knowledge of
the Company, any other party thereto has, performed all respective obligations
required to be performed by them under the Company Scheduled Contracts and are
not (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) in breach thereunder;
and (iii) none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any knowledge of,
or has received written notice of, any violation or default by it under (nor
does there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both would cause such a violation of or default under) any Company
Scheduled Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
properties or assets is bound or affected.

 Section 3.15 Litigation. There is no suit, claim, action, investigation,
arbitration or proceeding to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or with respect to which any of their respective property is affected,
as the case may be, pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction,
judgment or decree that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



Section 3.16 Real Property.



(a) Section 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all material real property (other than real property in the
nature of transmission or distribution lines and substations) owned in whole
or in part (including as a tenant in common or similar co-ownership with one
or more third parties) by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in fee
(collectively, the "Company Owned Real Property") and includes an
identification of such property (e.g. an address, a metes and bounds
description, a tax map identification or other specification), the name of the
record title holder thereof and a list, as of the date hereof, of all
Indebtedness secured by a Lien (other than Permitted Liens) thereon. The
Company or a Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, holds good and marketable
title in fee simple to all Company Owned Real Property, free and clear of all
Liens (other than Permitted Liens). The Company or a Company Subsidiary, as
the case may be, has valid title to the easements used by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of
the buildings, facilities, structures, infrastructures, lines, appurtenances
and other improvements situated on the Company Owned Real Property are in
operating condition and in a state of ordinary maintenance and repair
(ordinary wear and tear excepted) and are adequate and suitable for the
purposes for which they are presently being used except for any failures as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. None of such buildings, facilities,
structures, infrastructures, lines, appurtenances or other improvements (or
any equipment therein), nor the uses, operation or maintenance thereof,
violates any restrictive covenant or any provision of any applicable Law, or
encroaches on any property owned by third parties except for any violation or
encroachment as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, there are no outstanding options or rights of first
refusal which have been granted by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
third parties to purchase any Company Owned Real Property.



(b) Section 3.16(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains an accurate and
complete list and description, as of the date hereof, of all leases of
material real property (collectively, the "Company Real Property Leases") to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (as lessee, sublessee,
sublessor or lessor) and includes an identification of such property (e.g. an
address, a metes and bounds description, a tax map identification or other
specification) and the identity of the lessor, lessee and current occupant (if
different from the lessee). True and correct copies of such Company Real
Property Leases have been made available to the Parent. Except in each case as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in

 the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) each Company Real
Property Lease for real property under which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a lessee or sublessee (collectively, the "Company Leased Real
Property") is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding obligation
of the Company or the Company Subsidiary party thereto and, to the knowledge
of the Company, of the other parties thereto, enforceable against the Company
or the Company Subsidiary party thereto and, to the knowledge of the Company,
against the other parties thereto in accordance with its terms, except that
(A) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors' rights
generally and (B) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other
forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefore may be brought;
(ii) no written notices of default under any Company Real Property Lease have
been received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary that have not been
resolved; (iii) to the knowledge of the Company, there exists no default or
event, occurrence, condition or act (including the Merger) which, with the
giving of notice, the lapse of time or the happening of any further event or
condition, would become a default under any Company Real Property Lease; (iv)
all rents due to date on each such Company Real Property Lease have been paid;
and (v) the Company or a Company Subsidiary is and has been in peaceable
possession of each Company Leased Real Property since the commencement of the
original term of the related Company Real Property Lease and no waiver,
indulgence or postponement of the lessee's obligations under such Company Real
Property Lease has been granted by the applicable lessor. The Company or any
Company Subsidiary's interest in any Company Real Property Lease is free and
clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens).



(c) The Company Owned Real Property and the Company Leased Real Property are
referred to collectively herein as the "Company Real Property." With respect
to the Company Real Property, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has received any written notice of, nor to the knowledge of the Company does
there exist, (i) any pending, threatened or contemplated condemnation or
similar proceedings, or any sale or other disposition of any Company Real
Property or any part thereof in lieu of condemnation or (ii) any non-
compliance with any applicable building and zoning codes, deed restrictions,
ordinances and rules, that, in each case, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and the Company Subsidiaries have lawful rights of use and access to
all Company Real Property used in or necessary to conduct their businesses
substantially as presently conducted except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, no Governmental Entity
having the power of eminent domain over any of the Company Real Property has
provided written notice to the Company or any Company Subsidiary that it
intends to exercise the power of eminent domain or similar power with respect
to all or any part of the Company Real Property.



Section 3.17 Personal Properties. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect, (i) the Company or one of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable
title or, in the case of leased assets, a valid leasehold interest in, free
and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), all of the tangible
personal property and assets (except for properties and assets disposed of in
the ordinary course of business), used in or necessary to conduct their
businesses substantially as presently conducted and (ii) each

 item of tangible personal property of the Company and each Company Subsidiary,
or in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary owns an undivided interest,
is in all material respects in good working order and is adequate for the
Company or a Company Subsidiary's current use, ordinary wear and tear
excepted.

past five (5) years. The IT Assets do not contain any "time bombs," "trojan
horses," "back doors," "trap doors," worms, viruses, bugs, spyware, keylogger

where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure

Section 5.2 Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholder Meeting.



(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after the date hereof), the
Company shall prepare and file a preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC.
Subject to Section 5.4, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board
Recommendation. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation and
filing of the Proxy Statement, and shall furnish all information concerning it
that is necessary in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement
and is requested by the Company. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such filing and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company's common shareholders, in each case as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Company learns that the Proxy Statement will not be
reviewed or that the SEC staff has no further comments thereon. Prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other required documents
(or in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent
with an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including by participating in any discussions or meetings with the SEC) and
shall give good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent and its
counsel. The Company will notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company and the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(b) If, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall as promptly as practicable notify the other party and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the
SEC as promptly as practicable after the other party has had a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the common shareholders of the Company. The
Proxy Statement will comply as to form and substance in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and other applicable Law,
including the regulations and requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.



(c) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Company's common
shareholders in accordance with Section 5.2(a), duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, if on a date for which the Company Shareholder Meeting is
scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares to constitute a quorum and to obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right
to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company
Shareholder Meeting; provided, that the Company Shareholder Meeting is not
postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the
date for which the Company Shareholder Meeting was originally scheduled
(excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law). The
Company Board shall present this Agreement for approval at the Company
Shareholder Meeting. At the Company Shareholder Meeting, unless there shall
have been a Change of Company Board Recommendation in accordance with Section
5.4, the Company Board shall recommend that the Company's common shareholders
approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger (the "Company Board Recommendation"), and the Company
shall, unless there has been a Change of Company Board Recommendation, use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of
the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, and to take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the Company Shareholder Approval.



Section 5.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality.



(a) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall,
and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
advisors, agents and other representatives (collectively, "Company
Representatives") to: (i) provide to Parent and Merger Sub and their
respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, advisors, financing sources, agents, and other representatives
(collectively, the "Parent Representatives") reasonable access during normal
business hours in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
operation of any business conducted by the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
upon prior written notice to the Company, to the officers, employees,
auditors, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof; (ii) furnish
promptly information concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets
and liabilities of the Company and Company Subsidiaries as Parent or the
Parent Representatives may reasonably request; (iii) to the extent permitted
by Law, furnish promptly each report, schedule and other document filed or
received by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities or regulatory Laws or filed with
or sent to the SEC, FERC, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade
Commission or any other Governmental Entity, provided that the foregoing shall
not require the Company or any Company Subsidiary or Company Representative to
furnish any such materials that are otherwise publicly available or, unless
otherwise requested by Parent, that arise in the ordinary course of business
of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries; and (iv) promptly notify the
Parent of any material developments in any audit or similar proceeding related
to the change in any Utility Subsidiaries' tax accounting method related to
costs to repair and maintain utility assets; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to (or to cause any Company Subsidiary to)
afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the Company
believes in good faith that doing so would: (A) result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege; (B) violate any obligations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary with respect to confidentiality to any third party or
otherwise breach, contravene or violate any then effective Contract to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party; or (C) breach, contravene or
violate any applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other antitrust or
competition Law) (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (a) allow for such access or disclosure in a manner
that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege with respect to
clause (A) of this proviso, (b) obtain the required consent of such third
party to provide access to or disclosure of such information with respect to
clause (B) of this proviso, or (c) develop an alternative to providing such
information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company with respect to clauses (A), (B) or (C) of this
proviso); it being understood and agreed that the Company shall advise Parent
in such circumstances that it is unable to comply with Parent's reasonable
requests for information as a result of attorney-client privilege, Contract
obligations or applicable Law and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to generally describe the types of information being withheld. No
access, review or notice pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall have any effect
for the purpose of determining the accuracy of any representation or warranty
given by any of the parties hereto to any of the other parties hereto.



(b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to Section 5.3(a),
Parent shall comply with all of its obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement dated September 16, 2013 between the Company and Parent (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree
that nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be construed to prevent
Parent from making a request for reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.4(d) hereof or engaging in confidential
negotiations with the Company (including proposing changes to this Agreement)
pursuant to and in accordance with Sections 5.4(e), and 5.4(f) hereof. The
Company acknowledges and agrees that the immediately preceding sentence shall
not constitute or be deemed a request from Parent that the Company waive or
amend the provisions of paragraph 6 of the Confidentiality Agreement.



Section 5.4 No Solicitation of Transactions; Change of Company Board

Recommendation.



(a) Subject to Section 5.4(b), from and after the date hereof until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article VII, the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit any of its officers,
directors, or employees to, and shall instruct the Company Representatives not
to on behalf of the Company, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage or facilitate the submission of any Acquisition Proposal,
or any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
with any person, or furnish to any person any information, with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any discussion or negotiation with any
Persons conducted prior to the date hereof by the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of the Company Representatives with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a), if,
at any time following the date hereof and prior to the Company securing the
Company Shareholder Approval, (i) the Company has received a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal from a third party that was not solicited after the date
hereof by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives
and that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.4 and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the
Company may, subject to providing prior notice to Parent of its decision to
take any such action, (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and
its representatives and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its representatives regarding
such Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that the Company (x) will not,
will not allow the Company Subsidiaries to, will not permit or authorize the
directors and officers of the Company to, and will instruct the Company
Representatives not to, disclose any information to such Person without first
entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which shall
be provided, promptly after its execution, for informational purposes only, to
Parent) and (y) will as promptly as reasonably practicable provide to Parent
any information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries provided or
made available to such other Person (or its representatives) which was not
previously provided or made available to Parent.



(c) The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day) notify Parent in writing in the event that the
Company receives any written Acquisition Proposal, including the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
(i) keep Parent informed, in all material respects, on a reasonably prompt
basis, of the status, and details of any such Acquisition Proposal (including
any change to the material terms and conditions thereof) and (ii) provide to
Parent as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within one (1)
Business Day and at least one (1) Business Day prior to making any
determination with respect to such Acquisition Proposal) after receipt or
delivery thereof copies of all written material (including draft agreements)
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal
exchanged between the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Company
Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal (or its representatives), on the other hand.



(d) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or take
any action or make any public announcement inconsistent with the Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation (it being understood that, except as specified in
Section 5.4(g) below, taking a neutral position or no position with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification), (iii)
following the date any Acquisition Proposal or any material modification
thereto is first made public, sent or given to the shareholders of the
Company, fail to issue a press release that expressly reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days following Parent's written
request to do so (which request may only be made once with respect to any such
Acquisition Proposal and each material modification thereto) (any action set
forth in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), a "Change of Company Board
Recommendation"), (iv) allow or cause the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, would not include an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring the Company to
abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or (v) take any action pursuant to
which any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
affiliates) or Acquisition Proposal would become exempt from or not otherwise
subject to any take-over statute or certificate of incorporation provision
relating to Acquisition Proposals.



(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(d), at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and so long as
the Company is in compliance with this Section 5.4, if (i) the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel,
constitutes a Superior Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is not
withdrawn, or (ii) there occurs any change, event, occurrence, effect or
development that (A) is material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, (B) does not involve or relate to an Acquisition Proposal,
and (C) is not known to the Company Board as of the date hereof, the Company
Board may, in the cases of clauses (i) or (ii), make a Change of Company Board
Recommendation if (and only if) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that the
failure to do so would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; provided, however, that the Company Board may not make a Change of
Company Board Recommendation unless (1) the Company has provided prior written
notice to Parent that the Company Board intends to effect a Change of Company
Board Recommendation (a "Notice of Change of Recommendation"), which notice
shall specify the reasons therefor and, in the case of a Superior Proposal,
include the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and attach
a copy of the most current draft of any written agreement relating thereto,
(2) the Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent (including by making
Company Representatives reasonably available to negotiate) with respect to any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent for at least five
(5) Business Days following receipt by Parent of such Notice of Change of
Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that, in the case of a Superior
Proposal, if Parent has committed to any changes to the terms of this
Agreement and there has been any subsequent amendment to any material term of
such Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall provide a new Notice of Change
of Recommendation and an additional three (3) Business Day period from the
date of such notice) and (3) taking into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement committed to by Parent to the Company, the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel, that the failure by it to make a Change of Company Board
Recommendation would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal continues to
meet the definition of the term "Superior Proposal". The parties agree that
nothing in this Section 5.4(e) shall in any way limit or otherwise affect the
Company's right to terminate this Agreement under Section 7.1(f). The parties
agree that nothing in this Section 5.4(e) shall in any way limit or otherwise
affect Parent's right to terminate this Agreement under Section 7.1(e). Any
such Change of Company Board Recommendation shall not change the approval of
this Agreement or any other approval of the Company Board in any respect that
would have the effect of causing any corporate takeover statute or other
similar statute or any provision of the Company Charter to be applicable to
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and so long as
the Company is in compliance with this Section 5.4, if the Company receives an
Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, constitutes a
Superior Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn, the
Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f) to enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company
shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.4(f), and any
purported termination pursuant to this Section 5.4(f) shall be void, unless
(i) concurrently with such termination the Company pays (or causes a third
party to pay) the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section
7.2(b)(i), (ii) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent that
the Company intends to terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (a "Notice of Superior
Proposal"), which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal and attach a copy of the definitive agreement proposed
to be entered into with respect to such Superior Proposal, (iii) the Company
has negotiated in good faith with Parent (including by making the Company's
Representatives reasonably available to negotiate) with respect to any changes
to the terms of this Agreement committed to by Parent for at least five (5)
Business Days following receipt by Parent of such Notice of Superior Proposal
(it being understood and agreed that if Parent has committed to any changes to
the terms of this Agreement and there has been any subsequent amendment to any
material term of such Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall provide a new
Notice of Change of Recommendation and an additional three (3) Business Day
period from the date of such notice) and (iv) taking into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company, the Company
Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, that such Superior Proposal continues to meet
the definition of the term "Superior Proposal" as defined in Section 8.4 and
the failure by it to terminate this Agreement to enter into the definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal would be a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.



(g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of
the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company or would be
required by Law (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the fact
that a disclosure or other action may be deemed permissible by virtue of this
sentence does not in and of itself mean that such disclosure or other action
does not constitute a Change of Company Board Recommendation and the issuance
by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen" statement
pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of
Company Board Recommendation).



Section 5.5 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.

 (a) The Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i)
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other

applications and filings to be made under the HSR Act or with the FCC, which
shall be made at a time mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in
connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required
under or with respect to the Company Required Governmental Approvals, the DPA
and any other applicable Law; provided, that the Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other in connection with determining whether any action by
or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings. Each of Merger Sub
and the Company shall have the right to review and approve in advance drafts
of all such necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings and other
documents made or prepared in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
The Company and Parent shall furnish to each other all information required

the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.



(b) In the application filed with the ACC for the ACC Approval, Merger Sub and
the Company shall agree to include specific commitments and agreements in such
application to implement the principles set forth in Section 5.5(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. The Company agrees that it will not agree to, or
accept, any additional or different agreements, commitments or conditions in

(c) Neither Ultimate Parent, Parent nor the Company, directly or indirectly
through one or more of their respective affiliates, shall take any action,
including acquiring or making any investment in any corporation, partnership,
limited liability company or other business organization or any division or
assets thereof, that would reasonably be expected to cause a material delay in
the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Article VI or the consummation
of the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps and
to make, or cause to be made, any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control,
competition or trade regulation Law or any other Law applicable to the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Merger that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Effective
Time and the Closing, respectively, to occur as promptly as practicable (and
in any event, no later than the Extended Outside Date), including (A)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition
of such assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or (B) accepting any operational restrictions,
including restrictions on the ability to change rates or charges or standards
of service, or otherwise taking or committing to take actions that limit
Parent's or any Parent Subsidiary's freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain or freely operate, any of the assets, properties, licenses,
rights, product lines, operations or businesses of Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, in each case as may be required in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the lifting or dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying
the Effective Time or the Closing, as applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not be
required to, and the Company shall not, in connection with obtaining any
consents or approvals hereunder, or in connection with otherwise complying
with any provisions of this Agreement, consent to or take any action of the
types described above, including proposing or making any divestiture or other
undertaking or proposing, accepting or entering into any consent decree, hold
separate order or operational restriction, other than as specifically set
forth in Section 5.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case, that,
(x) individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, financial
condition or results of operations of Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole; or (y) individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of Ultimate
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the
Merger (any such divestiture or other undertaking, a "Regulatory Burdensome
Effect"); provided, for purposes of this sentence Ultimate Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger, shall be
deemed to be 100% of the size and scale (financially, commercially,
operationally and otherwise) as the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.



(d) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to obtain any
third party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii)
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as
applicable; provided, however that the Company and Parent shall coordinate and
cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers
are required to be obtained from parties to any Company Scheduled Contracts in
connection with consummation of the Merger and in seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers. In the event that either party shall fail to
obtain any third party consent described in this Section 5.5(d), such party
shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall take any such actions
reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect
upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries and their
respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result, after
the Effective Time, as applicable, from the failure to obtain such consent.



(e) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 5.5,
each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal
proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the
other parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other
parties of any communication to or from the Federal Trade Commission, the
Department of Justice, the FERC, the FCC, the Arizona Department of
Environmental Quality ("ADEQ"), the ACC, CFIUS or any other Governmental
Entity regarding the Merger. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with
the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other
parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in
connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Entity or by any Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding, each party hereto will use
reasonable efforts to permit authorized representatives of the other parties
to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding.



(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Company prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete unilateral control and supervision over its business operations.



Section 5.6 Certain Notices. From and after the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly after obtaining knowledge
thereof, notify the other party hereto of: (a) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to
effect the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not
to be satisfied; (b) the failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the
case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in
any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; (c) any
material actions, suits, claims or proceedings with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement commenced against the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or Parent, as the case may be (and the Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any
shareholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without Parent's prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)); and (d) any written notice or
other written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not cure any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice.



Section 5.7 Public Announcement. The Company, on the one hand, and Merger Sub
and Parent, on the other hand, agree to (i) consult with each other before
issuing any press release or public statement announcing the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, (ii) provide to each other for review a copy of
any such press release or public statement and (iii) not issue any such press
release or public statement prior to providing each other with a reasonable
period of time to review and comment on such press release or public
statement. Prior to making any material, broad-based written communications to
the employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary generally that
primarily relates to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide Parent with a copy of
the intended communication and provide Parent with a reasonable period of time
to review and comment on the communication.



Section 5.8 Employee Benefit Matters.



(a) From and after the Effective Time and for the period ending on the second
anniversary of the Effective Time (the "Benefit Protection Period"), the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain for the benefit of the employees of the
Company and Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Company Employees") (i) an annual base salary and incentive compensation
opportunities that are no less favorable than the annual base salary and
incentive compensation opportunities (including substituting comparable
incentive compensation opportunities for equity-based compensation
arrangements) provided to such Company Employee under the Company Benefit
Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) benefits to each
Company Employee that, on a plan-by-plan basis, are no less favorable than the
benefits under each applicable Company Benefit Plan provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any equity-based
compensation arrangements).



(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.8(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and continue without
amendment during the Benefit Protection Period or, if sooner, until all
obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Company Benefit Plans,
disclosed in Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter or entered into
after the date hereof to the extent permitted by Section 5.1(a)(x), that
constitute employment, severance and termination plans, policies, programs,
agreements and arrangements (including any change in control or severance
agreement between the Company and any Company Employee), in each case, as in
effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event), without any
amendment or modification, other than any amendment or modification required
to comply with applicable Law or as consented to by the parties thereto.



(c) With respect to any compensation or benefit plan, program, arrangement or
agreement including any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance
plans), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting, benefit
accruals and early retirement subsidies, each Company Employee's service with
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, to the extent service with
the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such Company
Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to the extent such service
was credited for similar purposes under a similar Company Benefit Plan;
provided, however, that such service need not be recognized (i) for purposes
of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan other than any
Single Employer Plan, or (ii) to the extent that such recognition would result
in any duplication of benefits.



(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, to waive, or cause to be waived, with respect to the
Company Employees any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively
at work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan
maintained by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries in which Company
Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from
and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall
cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to
recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or
her eligible dependents) under any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Company
Employee (and dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, to the extent so recognized under such applicable Company
Benefit Plan.



(e) Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall: (i) confer
upon any Company Employee or another employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or any other Person, any rights or remedies, including any right
to employment or continued employment for any period or terms of employment,
of any nature whatsoever; (ii) be interpreted to prevent or restrict Parent,
or any Parent Subsidiary, including the Surviving Corporation, from modifying
or terminating the employment or terms of employment of any Company Employee
or such other employee including the amendment or termination of any Company
Benefit Plan or any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or
arrangement according to its terms, after the Effective Time; or (iii) be
treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or
other employee benefit plan or arrangement.



(f) Upon each of (i) March 1, 2014 and (ii) the earlier to occur of March 1,

2015 and the date which is 30 days after the Effective Time, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each Company Employee who participates
in an annual incentive plan maintained by the Company and continues to be an
employee of the Surviving Corporation through each such applicable date, a
payment in an amount that is consistent with the past practices of the
Company; provided, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in calculating the level of attainment of the performance criteria
applicable to any such incentive compensation, the Company (or the Surviving
Corporation) shall exclude any expenses or costs

 associated with or arising as a result of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any non-recurring charges that
would not reasonably be expected to have been incurred had the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not occurred.



(g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 5.8, with respect to
any Company Employee whose terms and conditions of employment are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement between the Company or any Company Subsidiary
and a labor union, the terms and conditions of such employees shall instead be
governed by the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement. The
Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall take or
cause to be taken such actions as are required pursuant to the terms of any
applicable collective bargaining agreement covering employees of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

"fair price," "business combination" or other anti-takeover Law becomes, or is
deemed to be, applicable to the Merger, including the acquisition of Shares
pursuant thereto, or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
then each of the Company, Parent, the Company Board and the Parent Board shall
take all action reasonably available to it and grant such approvals to render
such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.



Section 5.10 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.



(a) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify
and hold harmless all past and present directors, officers and employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the same extent such Persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company By-
laws, the articles of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational
or governing documents, of any Company Subsidiary, and indemnification
agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with any
directors, officers, and employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless such persons to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval, adoption, execution and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Surviving
Corporation shall advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation with respect to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant
to this Section 5.10(a) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Company Charter, the Company By-laws, the articles of incorporation and
bylaws, or equivalent organizational documents, of any Company Subsidiary, and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement
and filed as an exhibit to a Company SEC Document, including any expenses
incurred in enforcing such Person's rights under this Section 5.10, regardless
of whether indemnification with respect to or advancement of such expenses is
authorized under the Company Charter, the Company By-laws, the articles of
incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational documents, of any
Company Subsidiary, or such indemnification agreements; provided, however,
that the director, officer or employee to whom expenses are advanced undertakes to repay such advanced expenses to Parent and
the Surviving Corporation if it is ultimately determined that such director,
officer or employee is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Section 5.10(a). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at
or after the Effective Time) is made against such persons with respect to
matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.10(a)
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.



(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors, officers and
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for periods at or prior
to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Charter and
the Company By-laws. The indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on
the date of this Agreement as disclosed on Section 5.10(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter with any of the directors, officers or employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation, without any further action, and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.



(c) For the benefit of the Company's directors and officers, as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted,
prior to the Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to
the Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance") that is substantially equivalent to
and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the Company's
existing policy (true and complete copies of which have been previously
provided to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that the portion
of the premium payable in respect of each year of such coverage shall not
exceed 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement (which annual premium is disclosed on Section 5.10(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter). If the Company is unable to purchase such DandO Insurance
prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, as of the Effective Time, obtain and fully
pay the premium for DandO Insurance that is substantially equivalent to and in
any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the Company's existing
policy (true and complete copies of which have been previously provided to
Parent); provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of
the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement; and
provided, further, that if the annual premium would at any time exceed 300%,
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to provide the maximum available
coverage as may be obtained for 300% from an insurance carrier having a
minimum A.M. Best credit rating of A- or higher. The Surviving Corporation
shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor
the obligations thereunder, for a period of not less than six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time.

merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.



(e) The obligations under this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any past or present
directors, officers and employees of the Company to whom this Section 5.10
applies without the consent of such affected Person (it being expressly agreed
that the persons for whose benefit this Section 5.10 applies are express third
party beneficiaries of this Section 5.10).

Subsidiaries in a public offering document, participating in customary due
diligence sessions that may be conducted by the underwriters of any securities
offering and to provide any necessary "comfort letters" and to prepare and
deliver other customary documents and instruments. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.18 shall require the cooperation or
participation of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Company
Representatives to the extent it would (A) unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise
unreasonably interfere with the prompt and timely discharge by the Company's
or any Company Subsidiary's employees of their normal duties, (B) cause any representation or warranty in this
Agreement to be breached, any condition to Closing set forth in Article VI to
fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement, (C)
require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to pay any out-of-
pocket fees or expenses prior to the Closing that are not promptly reimbursed
by the Parent, (D) require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to pledge any
assets as collateral, or pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other liability in connection with the Financings prior to the Closing, or
otherwise involve any binding commitment by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries unless such commitment is conditioned on the Closing and
terminates automatically and without liability to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries upon the termination of this Agreement or (E) cause any
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
incur any personal liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.18 shall require the Company Board to
take any action to approve any Financing.



(b) Parent shall (i) promptly upon request by the Company reimburse the
Company for all documented reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives in connection
with the Financings or the performance by the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives of the obligations contemplated
by this Section 5.18 and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and its
Affiliates and Representatives from and against any and all losses, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or

negligence or willful and material breach of the obligations of the Company,
its Affiliates or Representatives under this Agreement.



(c) Parent acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding the Company's
obligations under this Section 5.18, none of the obtaining of the Financing or
any alternative financing or the completion of any issuance of securities
contemplated by the Financing are a condition to the Closing, and reaffirms
its obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and independently
of the availability of the Financing or any alternative financing or the
completion of any such issuance, subject to the applicable conditions set
forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.

obligations of the Company to effect the Merger are also subject to the
satisfaction or waiver by the Company at or prior to the Effective Time of
each of the following additional conditions:



(a) Representations and Warranties. (i) Each of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement (other than

Effective Time as though made on and as of the Effective Time (except that

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

(A) by (1) either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section
7.1(c) or (2) Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(g), (B) prior to the termination
pursuant to Section 7.1(b), the Company Shareholder Meeting or the breach of

involving the Company shall have been made to the Company or the Company Board
or publicly disclosed and, in each case, not withdrawn and (C) within twelve
(12) months after the termination of this Agreement the Company shall have

this Section 7.2(b)(ii), the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 8.4, except that all percentages

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

(A) by (1) either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section
7.1(c) or (2) Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(g), and (B) prior to the
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b), the Company Shareholder Meeting or the
breach or failure to perform giving rise to Parent's right to terminate under
Section 7.1(g), as the case may be, an Acquisition Proposal involving the

Days after the date of such demand, by wire transfer of same day funds, for
all fees and expenses incurred or paid by or on behalf of Parent in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including all fees and expenses incurred in connection with Parent's equity
and debt Financing and fees and expenses of counsel ("Parent Transaction

(c) Any payment under Section 7.2(b) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.



(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) without these agreements,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not enter into this Agreement. It is
acknowledged and agreed that the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but
rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is payable;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit Parent's rights with
respect to any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by Ultimate Parent,
Parent or Merger Sub as a result of the willful and material breach by the
Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement (including any such case in which the Company
Termination Fee or Parent Transaction Expenses is payable pursuant to this
Section 7.2, to the extent any such liability or damage suffered

 by Parent exceeds the amount of the Company Termination Fee or Parent
Transaction Expenses payable pursuant to this Section 7.2, it being the intent
that any Company Termination Fee or Parent Transaction Expenses shall, to the
extent of such payment, serve as credit against and off-set any liability or
damage suffered by Parent as a result of the willful and material breach by
the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement). In no event shall the Company be required to pay
to Parent more than one Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.2(b). In
the event that any payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 7.2 is
not paid by the date so required, such amount payable shall bear interest at a
rate equal to the greater of (i) the current per annum interest rate published
by the Federal Reserve Board in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519)
(Selected Interest Rates) as the "bank prime loan" rate and (ii) five percent
(5%) per annum. The unsuccessful party in any action to enforce the provisions
of this Section 7.2 shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by the successful party to such action.



Section 7.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of
Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that,
after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, no amendment may be made
which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange,
requires further approval by the Company's shareholders without obtaining such
further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto.



Section 7.4 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other,
(b) waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the other
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance by the other with any of the covenants or conditions contained
herein; provided, however, that after receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, there may not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement which
decreases the Merger Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of
the Company's shareholders hereunder without the approval of such shareholders
at a duly convened meeting of the Company's shareholders called to obtain
approval of such extension or waiver. Any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or
parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist
on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure.



ARTICLE VIII GENERAL PROVISIONS

representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective

Section 8.6 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.



Section 8.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.



Section 8.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
Company Disclosure Letter, Parent Disclosure Letter and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.



Section 8.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or
transferred, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of
the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties,
except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to
(i) one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Ultimate
Parent at any time and (ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person; provided,
that no such transfer or assignment shall relieve Ultimate Parent, Parent or
Merger Sub from any of its obligations hereunder or make it more difficult for
Ultimate Parent to comply with its obligations under the Ultimate Parent
guarantee set forth in Section 8.15. Any assignment or transfer in violation
of the preceding sentence shall be void.



Section 8.10 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than: (a)
any Persons entitled to indemnification under the provisions of Section 5.10,
with respect to such provisions, who shall be entitled to enforce their rights
under this Agreement as third-party beneficiaries; (b) the shareholders of the
Company, in the event of a termination of this Agreement as a result of a
breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, subject to Section 7.2(a),
with respect to the lost opportunity to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the rights granted
pursuant to this clause (b) shall only be enforceable by the Company on behalf
of the shareholders of the Company (and not directly by any such shareholder)
(it being understood and agreed that any and all interests in such claims
shall attach to the Shares and subsequently trade and transfer therewith and,
consequently, any damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or received
by the Company with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred by the
Company in connection therewith) may, in the Company's sole and absolute
discretion, be (i) distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company to the
holders of Shares of record as of any date determined by the Company or (ii)
retained by the Company for the use and benefit of the Company on behalf of
its shareholders in any manner the Company deems fit); and (c) the
shareholders of the Company, after the Effective Time, with respect to the
right of such shareholders to receive Merger Consideration for any Share such
shareholder holds.



Section 8.11 Mutual Drafting; Interpretation. Each party hereto has
participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges
is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the
context requires: (i) the singular number shall include the plural, and vice
versa; (ii) the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter
genders; (iii) the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter
genders; and (iv) the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine
genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Except as
otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections" and
"Exhibits," are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits to this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to
"$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically
provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. The
words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when
used in this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement.



Section 8.12 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury.



(a) Except to the extent the ABCA is mandatorily applicable to the Merger,
this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Delaware without regard to Laws that may be applicable under
conflicts of laws principles that would cause the application of the Laws of
any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.



(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any appellate court from therefrom in the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware and any appellate court from any thereof) in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating hereto or
thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such court,
(ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in such court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such court,
and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in such
court located in Delaware. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 8.3. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law.



(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO

EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES THE
FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 8.12(c).



Section 8.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by
electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.



Section 8.14 Specific Performance.



(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that each party
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief without the posting of any bond, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically in the courts of the State of Delaware
and of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware the terms
and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereby
further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing: (i) the Company shall
be entitled to specific performance (A) to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of, Section 5.5 by Parent or
Merger Sub or Section 8.15 by Ultimate Parent and (B) if (x) all conditions in

Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub and/or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, including to cause Ultimate Parent, Parent
and/or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2, on the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement; and (ii) Parent and Merger

be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied and (B) the Company fails to
complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to Section 1.2, to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement by the
Company and/or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, including to cause the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in accordance with
Section 1.2, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.
Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that
(x) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.



(b) The parties further agree that (i) the seeking of the remedies provided
for in Section 8.14(a) shall not in any respect constitute a waiver by any
party seeking such remedies of its respective right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to it under this Agreement, including under Section 7.2, in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in Section 8.14(a)
are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in
this Agreement shall require a party to institute any proceeding for (or limit
a party's right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under
Section 8.14(a) prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under Article VII (and pursuing damages after

such termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant
to Section 8.14(a) or anything set forth in this Section 8.14(b) restrict or
limit a party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms
of Article VII or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be
available then or thereafter.



Section 8.15 Ultimate Parent Guarantee.



(a) Ultimate Parent hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally
guarantees to the Company the due, prompt and punctual payment and performance
when due of all of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations and agreements under
this Agreement up to and including the Closing, including the consummation of
the Merger, the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and the
performance of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations under Sections 2.2 and
5.5, it being understood that Ultimate Parent shall have no obligation to
guarantee any post-Closing obligations or agreements. Ultimate Parent's
obligations are unconditional irrespective of any circumstances which might
otherwise constitute, by operation of law, a discharge of a guarantor and it
shall not be necessary for the Company to institute or exhaust any remedies or
causes of action against Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person as a
condition to the obligations of Ultimate Parent hereunder.



(b) Ultimate Parent hereby represents and warrants to the Company that it: (i)
is a corporation or other legal entity duly incorporated or organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization and has requisite corporate or other legal
entity, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted; (ii) is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties
or assets or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
or materially impair the ability of Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or to perform its obligations hereunder; and (iii) owns, directly or
indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other
Equity Interests in Parent.



(c) Ultimate Parent hereby represents and warrants to the Company that: (i) it
has the requisite corporate or other legal entity, as the case may be, power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger; (ii) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Ultimate Parent, and the performance by Ultimate Parent of its obligations
hereunder, have been duly and validly authorized by all requisite corporate or
other legal entity, as the case may be, action on the part of Ultimate Parent
and no other corporate or other legal entity, as the case may be, proceedings
on the part of Ultimate Parent, and no shareholder or other equityholder
votes, are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to perform its obligations hereunder; (iii) this Agreement has been duly authorized and validly executed
and delivered by Ultimate Parent and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
Ultimate Parent, enforceable against Ultimate Parent in accordance with its
terms, except that (x) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting creditors' rights generally and (y) the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject
to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought; and (iv) none of the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement by Ultimate Parent will (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both): (x) conflict with or violate any provision
of the articles of incorporation or bylaws, or any equivalent organizational
or governing documents, of Ultimate Parent; (y) conflict with or violate any
Law applicable to Ultimate Parent or any of its properties or assets; or (z)
require any consent or approval under, violate, conflict with, result in any
breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or constitute a default under, or
result in termination or give to others any right of termination, vesting,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Ultimate Parent pursuant to, any
Contract or permit to which Ultimate Parent is a party or by which it or any
of its respective properties or assets are bound, except, with respect to
clauses (y) and (z), for any such conflicts, violations, consents, breaches,
losses, defaults, other occurrences or Liens which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Ultimate Parent to perform its obligations
under this Agreement.
