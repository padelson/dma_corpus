3. Representations and Warranties of the Selling Parties.
   ------------------------------------------------------

     The Selling Parties jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Buyer, in each case except as set forth in the subsection and paragraph of the
Disclosure Schedule corresponding to such subsection or paragraph of this
Section 3, as follows:

     3.1. The Seller; Subsidiaries; Investments.

          (a) The Seller is a Delaware corporation, duly organized, validly
     existing, and in good standing under the laws of Delaware. The Seller's
     certificate of incorporation and bylaws as incorporated by reference in the
     2000 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2000 (the "2000 Fiscal
     Year End") are accurate and complete copies thereof and have not been
     subsequently amended. All of the Seller's Subsidiaries are listed on
     Exhibit 21 to the 2000 10-K, and all such Subsidiaries are wholly-owned.
     The Seller and each of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and is
     in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction listed in
     Section 3.1(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, which such jurisdictions are the
     only jurisdictions where the nature of the activities conducted by it or
     the character of the property owned, leased or operated by it make such
     qualification necessary or appropriate, except for any failure to be so
     qualified that has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
     individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Seller and
     each of its Subsidiaries has full corporate power and authority and all
     licenses, permits, and authorizations necessary to carry on the businesses
     in which it is engaged and in which it presently proposes to engage and to
     own and use the properties owned and used by it, except where any failure
     to have such power, authority or authorization has not had and would not
     reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
     Material Adverse Effect. The Seller has delivered to the Buyer correct and
     complete copies of the charter and bylaws, or any other similar governing
     or organizational documents, of each of its Subsidiaries (each as amended
     to date). Neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default
     under or in violation of any provision of its charter, bylaws or any other
     similar governing or organizational documents.

     ownership interest or to which the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries have
     extended any loan or similar investment. With respect to each Person set
     forth in Section 3.1(b)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Seller
     nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liability in respect of or other

     ownership interest of, or other investment in, such Person. Except as set
     forth on Section 3.1(b)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule, no Person other
     than the Selling Parties has any right, title or interest in any capital
     stock of, or other ownership interest in, any Person set forth in Section
     3.1(b)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule or in any of their respective profits,
     earnings, gains or losses or any warrant, option or similar right to
     acquire any such capital stock or ownership interest. Except as set forth
     in Section 3.1(b)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Seller nor
     any of its Subsidiaries has any joint venture, partnership or other
     Contractual Obligation with James Shooter or otherwise with respect to the
     ventures known as "Broadway Comics" or "Defiant Comics".

     3.2. Authorization. Each of the Selling Parties has the power and authority

permit the execution and delivery by each of them of this Agreement and the
documents required to be executed and delivered by each of them pursuant hereto,
the performance by each of them of their respective obligations hereunder and
thereunder, and the consummation by each of them of the transactions
contemplated herein and therein, have been duly and properly taken. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of the Selling Parties
and constitutes, subject to obtaining the Approval Order in order to consummate
the Closing, the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of them,

          the possession of the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries that are

          substantially all masters, duplicate masters (including foreign
          language dubbed or titled versions), sub-masters or other pre-print
          elements or similar tangible assets) and (y) the address and/or
          location of all material tangible assets in the possession of the
          Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries that are included in the
          Acquired Assets (including the location of all material masters,

          sub-masters or other pre-print elements or similar tangible assets)

          sub-masters or other pre-print elements or similar tangible assets).

          (c) Condition and Storage of Certain Assets. For substantially all
     Works and for each material Work, there exist original or duplicate
     negatives or other appropriate

     and customary pre-print elements and duplicating materials, sound tracks
     and other materials, owned and controlled by the Seller and/or one or more
     of its Subsidiaries and sufficient to create masters, duplicate masters and
     sub-masters in a manner sufficient to conduct the Business. The Seller
     and/or its Subsidiaries are storing substantially all Works and each
     material Work in a manner which in the exercise of reasonable business
     judgment is sufficient to preserve such Works for exploitation in the
     conduct of the Business. Since December 25, 1999, no master or sub-master
     embodying any of the Works has suffered any material damage or been
     destroyed or misplaced or otherwise lost, except for (i) ordinary wear and
     tear, (ii) instances where that same has since been replaced, or (iii)
     instances where the same is capable of being replaced at a nominal cost not
     exceeding $10,000 with respect to any single item or $50,000 in the
     aggregate.

          (d) Equipment and Similar Tangible Assets. The Seller's and its
     Subsidiaries' respective buildings, real property, improvements, machinery,
     equipment, and other similar material tangible assets are, in the

     maintained, in the aggregate, in accordance with normal industry practice,
     are in good satisfactory operating condition and repair (subject to normal
     wear and tear), and are suitable for the purposes for which they are
     currently used.

     3.6. All Assets Necessary to Conduct Business. The Acquired Assets comprise
all of the assets, properties and rights of every type and description, real,
personal, tangible and intangible (other than the Excluded Assets) held or used
by the Selling Parties in and, in the reasonable opinion of the management of
the Selling Parties, necessary to, the Business as currently conducted.

     3.7. Financial Statements; SEC Reports.

     reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents with the
     Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") from January 27, 2000

     2000 10-K, the "SEC Reports"). The Seller has delivered to the Buyer a
     stand-alone balance sheet as of the 2000 Fiscal Year End and an income
     statement for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2000 for GB Canada, copies
     of which are attached hereto as Exhibit F (the "GB Canada Stand-Alone
     Financials"). The financial statements contained in the SEC Reports (or
     incorporated therein by reference), and the 2000 Audited Financial
     Statements (collectively, the "Financial Statements"), were prepared in
     accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods specified
     therein (except, in the case of the unaudited interim consolidated
     financial statements, as may be permitted under Form 10-Q of the Securities
     Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), are correct and
     complete in all material respects, present fairly, in all material
     respects, the financial condition of the Seller and its Subsidiaries as of
     such dates and the results of operations of the Seller and its Subsidiaries
     for such periods specified therein and are consistent with the books and
     records of the Seller and its Subsidiaries. The unaudited interim
     consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
     2000

     interim consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with
     the requirements of the Exchange Act, except for the inclusion of
     footnotes. In the opinion of the Seller, the unaudited interim consolidated
     financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal
     recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the
     consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of
     the Seller and its Subsidiaries, for the periods indicated. The GB Canada

     with GAAP; (iii) are fairly presented in all material respects; and (iv)
     are consistent with the books and records of the Seller and its
     Subsidiaries. The Execution Date Schedule of Liabilities is attached as
     Exhibit C-1 and reflects liabilities recorded in the books and records of
     the Seller and its Subsidiaries which have been determined in accordance
     with the Company's standard practices subject to the adjustments included
     in Exhibit C-1. The Closing Date Schedule of Liabilities will be in the
     same form as the Execution Date Schedule of Liabilities and it will be
     prepared in accordance with the procedures specified in Exhibit E.

          (b) On the date of filing thereof, each SEC Report complied in all
     material respects with the then applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
     and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the
     rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder (other than with
     respect to the failure of the Seller to timely file (i) the 2000 10-K and
     (ii) the Seller's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for its fiscal quarter
     ending March 31, 2001) and did not contain any untrue statement of a
     material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
     circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the
     Seller's Subsidiaries is required to file any statements or reports with
     the SEC. As of their respective dates, all reports and statements filed by
     the Seller with the SEC prior to the Closing Date will comply in all
     material respects with the then applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
     and the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
     thereunder and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
     omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
     make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
     are made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of the
     Seller to be included in such reports and statements will be prepared in
     accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods specified
     therein and will be correct and complete in all material respects, will
     present fairly the financial condition of the Seller and its Subsidiaries
     as of such dates and the results of operations of the Seller and its
     Subsidiaries for such periods and will be consistent with the books and
     records of the Seller and its Subsidiaries.

     aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; (iv) to the Knowledge of the Seller
     and its Subsidiaries, since April 1, 1998 and prior to the Execution Date,

     a Material Adverse Effect).

     therein) is $744,684.

     3.16. Notes and Accounts Receivable. The notes and accounts receivable of

                                      -36-

<PAGE>


          (c) All insurance policies (taken together) of the Seller and its
     Subsidiaries provide adequate coverage for all normal risks incident to the
     Seller's and its Subsidiaries' assets, properties and business operations.

     3.18. Litigation. Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports or in Section 3.18
of the Disclosure Schedule, (a) as of the Execution Date there are no judicial
or administrative actions, claims, suits, proceedings or investigations pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Seller and its Subsidiaries, threatened, that have
had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect and (b) there are no judicial or administrative actions,
claims, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Seller and its Subsidiaries, threatened, that question the validity of this
Agreement or of any action taken or to be taken pursuant to or in connection
with the provisions of, or that seeks rescission of or to enjoin the
consummation of, this Agreement. Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports or in
Section 3.18 of the Disclosure Schedule, as of the Execution Date, there are no
judgments, orders, decrees, citations, fines or penalties heretofore assessed
against the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries affecting the Acquired Assets
or Assumed Liabilities, except for those that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. The Seller has provided or made available to the Buyer correct
and complete copies of all audit inquiry response letters prepared to date by

correspondence received between the Execution Date and the Closing Date.

     3.19. Employees. Since January 27, 2000, neither the Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries has experienced any labor disputes or work stoppage due to labor
disagreements. The Seller and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws respecting employment and employment
practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours and have not
been and are not engaged in any unfair labor practice as defined in the National
Labor Relations Act, as amended, the violation of which has had or would be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no unfair labor
practice charge or complaint against the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries
pending or threatened before the National Labor Relations Board. No grievance
which might have an adverse effect on the Seller and its Subsidiaries and their
respective operations or prospects nor any arbitration proceeding arising out of
or under any collective bargaining agreement is pending and no pending claims
therefore have been made. No collective bargaining agreement of the Seller
and/or any of its Subsidiaries restricts (to a material degree) any of them from
relocating, closing or subcontracting any of its operations. With respect to
current employees, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has any
collective bargaining relationship or duty to bargain with any Labor
Organization (as such term is defined in Section 2(5) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended) or (ii) has recognized any Labor Organization as the
collective bargaining representative of any of its current employees. None of
the current employees of the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries is
represented by a labor union, nor is there, to the Knowledge of the Seller and
its Subsidiaries as of the Execution Date, any organization effort currently
being made or threatened by or on behalf of any labor union to organize any
current employees of the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries. No Selling Party
is a party to any collective bargaining agreement with respect to its current
employees. No Selling Party has any Liability arising under


                                      -37-

<PAGE>


any collective bargaining agreement other than for post-retirement medical
and/or life insurance benefits arising solely under collective bargaining
agreements identified on Section 3.19 of the Disclosure Schedule.

     3.20. Employee Benefits.

          (a) Seller Plans. Section 3.20(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets
     forth all Employee Benefit Plans (i) which are maintained by the Seller
     and/or any of its Subsidiaries or by any member of their Related Group, or
     to which the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries or any member of their
     Related Group contribute or are required to contribute or with respect to
     which the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries or any member of their
     Related Group have or may have any Liability or become subject to a Lien
     under ERISA or the Code, and (ii) which benefit any present or former
     employee, director or independent contractor (or any dependent or
     beneficiary thereof) of the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries or any
     member of their Related Group (a "Seller Plan"). For purposes of this
     Agreement, the term "Employee Benefit Plan" means any plan, program,
     agreement, policy or arrangement (a "plan"), whether or not reduced to
     writing, that is: (w) a welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section
     3(1) of ERISA (a "Welfare Plan"); (x) a pension benefit plan within the
     meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA; (y) a stock bonus, stock purchase, stock
     option, restricted stock, stock appreciation right or similar equity-based
     plan; or (z) any other deferred-compensation, retirement, welfare, benefit,

     a group of individuals.

          (b) Documentation. With respect to each Seller Plan, the Seller has
     provided to the Buyer accurate, current and complete copies of each of the
     following: (1) where the plan has been reduced to writing, the plan
     document together with all amendments; (2) where the plan has not been
     reduced to writing, a written summary of all material plan terms; (3) where
     applicable, copies of any trust agreements, custodial agreements, insurance
     policies, administration agreements and similar agreements, and investment
     management or investment advisory agreements; (4) copies of any summary
     plan descriptions, employee handbooks or similar employee communications;
     (5) in the case of any plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
     401(a) of the Code, a copy of the most recent determination letter from the
     IRS and any related correspondence; (6) in the case of any funding
     arrangement intended to qualify as a VEBA under Section 501(c)(9) of the
     Code, a copy of the IRS letter determining that it so qualifies; (7) in the
     case of any plan for which Forms 5500 are required to be filed, a copy of
     the three most recently filed Forms 5500, with schedules and financial
     audits, if required, attached; and (8) copies of any notices, letters or
     other correspondence from the United States Internal Revenue Service or the
     United States Department of Labor relating to the plan.

          (c) Defined Benefit Pension Plans. Except as specified in Section
     3.20(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Seller and/or any of its
     Subsidiaries nor any member of their Related Group have ever maintained or
     been required to contribute to any Employee Benefit Plan subject to Title
     IV of ERISA. Section 3.20(c) of the Disclosure Schedule specifies which of
     the Employee Benefit Plans listed in such Section 3.20(c) are
     "multiemployer plans" as that term is defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of
     ERISA.


                                      -38-

          (d) Plan Qualification; Plan Administration; Certain Taxes and
     Penalties. Each Seller Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
     401(a) of the Code is so qualified. Each Seller Plan, including any
     associated trust or fund, has been administered in accordance with its
     terms and with applicable law. Nothing has occurred with respect to any
     Seller Plan that has subjected or could subject any employee of the Seller
     and/or any of its Subsidiaries or any member of their Related Group to a
     Tax under Sections 4973 or 4975 of the Code or to a penalty or Liability
     under Section 502 of ERISA.

          (e) All Contributions And Premiums Paid. Except as specified in
     Section 3.20(e) of the Disclosure Schedule, all required contributions to
     and premium payments (including PBGC premiums) on account of each Seller
     Plan have been made. No event has occurred that has resulted in or could
     subject the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries or any member of their
     Related Group to a Tax under Section 4971 of the Code or the assets of any
     of them to a Lien under Section 412(n) of the Code. Except to the extent
     set forth in Section 3.20(e) of the Disclosure Schedule, no Employee
     Benefit Plan is or within the last three calendar years has been the
     subject of examination by a government agency or a participant in a
     government sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance or similar program.

          (f) Plans Adequately Funded, Etc. Except as described in Section
     3.20(f) of the Disclosure Schedule, in the case of each Seller Plan subject
     to Title IV of ERISA, other than any such plan that is a "multiemployer
     plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, (i) the current
     fair market value of the assets of the plan equals or exceeds the present
     value of all benefit liabilities under the plan determined on a plan
     termination basis, and (ii) no "reportable event" (as that term is defined
     in Section 4043 of ERISA), other than any such event for which the
     reporting requirements have been waived by regulation, has occurred. No
     event has occurred that could subject the Seller and/or any of its
     Subsidiaries or any member of their Related Group to Liability under
     Sections 4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Neither the Seller and/or any of its
     Subsidiaries nor any member of their Related Group under Part 1 of Subtitle
     E of Title IV of ERISA is subject to any Liability on account of any
     "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.

          (g) Claims. Section 3.20(g) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each
     and every pending or, to the Knowledge of the Seller and its Subsidiaries
     or a member of their Related Group, threatened lawsuit, claim or other
     controversy relating to a Seller Plan, other than claims for benefits in
     the normal course.

          (h) Retiree Benefits; Certain Welfare Plans. Except as described in
     Section 3.20(h) of the Disclosure Schedule and other than as required under
     Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, no Seller Plan that is a Welfare Plan
     provides benefits or coverage following retirement or other termination of
     employment. Nothing has occurred with respect to any Seller Plan that is an
     Employee Benefit Plan described in Section 4980B of the Code that could
     subject the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries or any member of their
     Related Group to a Tax under Section 4980B of the Code. Each welfare
     benefit trust or fund that constitutes or is associated with a Seller Plan
     and that is intended to be exempt from federal income tax under Section
     501(c)(9) of the Code is so exempt.


                                      -39-

<PAGE>


          (i) No Restrictions On Termination. Except to the extent set forth in
     Section 3.20(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, no provision of any Seller
     Plan, other than any such plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the
     meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, would result in any limitation on
     the ability of the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the
     plan with respect to employees of the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries
     without material Liability.

          (j) Unfunded Liabilities. The Financial Statements of the Seller and
     its Subsidiaries accurately reflect the present value (as accounted for in
     accordance with GAAP) of all unfunded liabilities of all the Employee
     Benefit Plans of the Seller and its Subsidiaries and all members of their
     Related Group as of the relevant dates specified therein.

          (k) Non-U.S. Plans. Without limiting the applicability of other
     provisions of this Section 3.20, with respect to any plan, agreement,
     policy or arrangement that it is maintained outside of the United States
     (the "Foreign Plans"), except as set forth in Section 3.20(k) of the
     Disclosure Schedule, each such plan has been administered in accordance
     with its terms and complies with the requirements prescribed by any Laws in
     all respects. With respect to the Foreign Plans, the Seller has provided to

     Execution Date have been made or accrued and all required contributions to
     and premium payments on account of each Foreign Plan required to be made
     through the Closing shall be made on or before the Closing Date. Except as
     set forth in Section 3.20(k) of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no
     unfunded Liabilities under any Foreign Plan. Except as set forth in Section
     3.20(k) of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no severance or other
     benefits required by Law or the terms of any Foreign Plan to employees
     covered thereby by reason of the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement.

          (b) In addition, from and after the Execution Date until the Closing
     Date the Selling Parties will provide (i) full and complete copies of the
     check register of the Seller and each of its Subsidiaries, (ii) for any

     the Seller's negotiation strategies in connection with the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement provided directly or indirectly by the
     Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates
     (excluding for these purposes any Person who is deemed an Affiliate
     hereunder solely as a result of the ownership of securities but not
     excluding any such Person that is acting at the direct or indirect request
     or direction of any Selling Party), advisors or representatives to any
     bank, lender or source of funding or financing, any holder of its

     however, that if such information has previously been provided to the
     Buyer, the Seller shall notify the Buyer in writing, in advance, that such
     information will be provided to such other Person; provided, further, that
     if the Buyer informs the Seller that it desires to receive such information

     business days after the Buyer has so informed the Seller) provide a true
     and complete copy of such information to the Buyer.

          (d) No later than five business days prior to the date that is
     scheduled for the Closing, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer and its
     legal, accounting and financial representatives the Closing Date Schedule
     of Liabilities and a statement setting forth an estimate of the amounts to
     be set forth in the Certificate of Certain Cash Amounts. Thereafter,
     pursuant to (in the case of clause (A) below only) Exhibits C-1 and E, on
     the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Seller (in consultation
     with the Buyer and its legal, accounting and financial representatives)
     will make adjustments to (A) the items listed in such Closing Date Schedule
     of Liabilities for the purpose of calculating the Excess Accrued
     Liabilities, and (B) the estimates set forth in the statement (referred to
     in the immediately preceding sentence) estimating the amounts to be set
     forth in the Certificate of Certain Cash Amounts, on a current basis, and

     financial representatives a statement setting forth in reasonable detail
     such adjustments to the items referred to in clauses (A) and (B), all
     pursuant to procedures mutually satisfactory to the Buyer and the Seller.
     The Seller expressly agrees to provide the Buyer and its legal, accounting
     and financial representatives with access to work papers related to the
     preparation of the Execution Date Schedule of Liabilities, the Closing Date
     Schedule of Liabilities and the other statements referred to in the
     previous sentence and to all books and records that are required to verify
     the same.

          (e) Intentionally Deleted.

     5.3. Notice of Developments. Each Party will give prompt written notice to
the other Party of any development causing, or which creates a reasonable
likelihood of causing, a breach of any of its own representations and warranties
in Section 3 and Section 4 or an inability of such Party to deliver the closing
bring-down certificate to be delivered by it pursuant to Section 6.1 or Section
6.2, as the case may be. No disclosure by any Party pursuant to this Section
5.3, however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or
to prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty, or breach of
covenant or to satisfy any closing condition. Neither the covenants contained in
this Section 5.3 nor any remedy for a breach thereof shall survive the Closing.

     5.4. Hart-Scott-Rodino Cooperation. The Buyer and the Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall cooperate with each other (at their respective sole cost and
expense) to comply with, and provide the information required by, the pre-merger
notification and waiting period rules of the HSR Act, any Federal Trade
Commission regulations, and any provisions or regulations of or relating to the
Clayton Act. In that connection, the Buyer (or its ultimate parent entity, if
any) and the Seller (or its ultimate parent entity, if any) shall each make its
respective pre-merger notification filing with the Federal Trade Commission as
soon as practicable, but in any event no later than the first business day after
the date the Approval Order is entered by the Bankruptcy Court, provided that,
if the Approval Order is so entered prior to August 8, 2001, the Buyer (or its
ultimate parent entity, if any) and the Seller (or its ultimate parent entity,
if any) shall each make its respective pre-merger notification filing no later
than August 8, 2001.

     5.5. Intentionally Deleted.

     5.6. Intentionally Deleted.

     5.7. Good Faith. Each of the Parties will use commercially reasonable
efforts to take all actions and to do all other things necessary, proper, or
advisable (including, to the extent within such Party's control, such of the
same as necessary to cause the conditions to the other Parties' obligations
hereunder to be timely satisfied) in order to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

     5.8. Public Announcements. The Seller and its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and the Buyer, on the other, will consult with each other before, and
obtain the other party's consent with respect to, issuing any press release,
making any filing with the SEC or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall
not issue any such press release, make any such SEC filing or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation and consent, except to the extent
that compliance with Law requires a party to issue a press release or public
announcement or make an SEC filing without such consultation and consent;
provided that the press release attached hereto as Exhibit J is expressly agreed
to among the Parties. Any consent required pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

     5.9. Future SEC Filings. The Seller will deliver to the Buyer as soon as
they become available true and complete copies of any report or statement filed
by it with the SEC subsequent to the Execution Date.

     5.10. Intentionally Deleted.

     5.11. Intentionally Deleted.

     5.12. Certain Artech Matters.

          (a) Intentionally Deleted.

          (b) From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer will provide reasonable
     assistance to the agents and other representatives of the bankruptcy estate
     of the Selling Parties (the "Estate") in connection with negotiating the
     release of the Artech Escrowed Funds and other related matters. Such
     assistance shall be at the expense of the Estate. In the event that the
     Buyer receives any Artech Assets or the proceeds thereof, including any
     Artech Escrowed Funds, the Buyer shall hold the same in trust for the
     benefit of the Estate and shall promptly deliver such assets and proceeds
     to the Estate, net of the amount of any expenses related to the recovery of
     such assets and proceeds not paid by the Estate pursuant to the immediately
     preceding sentence.

          (c) The Buyer agrees that it shall not settle any dispute relating to
     any Artech Assets or Artech Liabilities without the prior written consent
     of a duly authorized representative of the Estate.


                                      -47-

<PAGE>


          (d) It is further understood that as part of the resolution of any
     dispute relating to the Artech Escrow, the Estate may agree or otherwise
     find itself the owner of certain inventory located at the Artech facility
     that are not Artech Assets in that such inventory was never owned by the
     Selling Parties. The Estate will have the right to sell such inventory, and
     the Buyer will have the option, in its sole discretion, to negotiate with
     the Estate for the purchase of such inventory, but neither party will be
     under any obligation to the other in this regard.

          (e) The Selling Parties shall not agree to any amendment or
     modification or grant any waiver with respect to any provision contained in
     any Artech Agreement, which amendment or waiver would have an adverse
     effect on the Buyer. The Seller shall notify the Buyer promptly following
     the time that any Selling Party becomes aware of any breach by Artech under
     the Printing Services Agreement dated as of November 29, 1999, between
     Artech and the Seller (the "PSA") or the Artech Asset Purchase Agreement.
     The Selling Parties shall strictly enforce the terms of the PSA and the
     Artech Asset Purchase Agreement to the extent the failure to do so could
     reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the Buyer or any of its
     Affiliates. The Buyer shall have the right to pursue or to direct one or
     more of the Selling Parties to pursue any claim based upon any such breach.
     The Selling Parties shall take such actions as may be reasonably requested
     by the Buyer in the pursuit of any such claim and, except as may be
     prohibited by applicable Law, shall make available to the Buyer all
     witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Selling
     Parties' possession or under the Selling Parties' control relating thereto.
     The Selling Parties will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
     into any settlement with respect to any such claim without the prior
     written consent of the Buyer. The Buyer shall promptly reimburse the
     Selling Parties for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
     incurred by them in connection with actions taken at the request of the
     Buyer in pursuit of any such claim or otherwise required by this Section
     5.12(d).

     5.13. Buyer DIP Facility. If, at any time following the entry by the
Bankruptcy Court of the Approval Order, the Seller reasonably believes that the
borrowing availability under the DIP Facility is or will soon be less than
$1,000,000, Classic shall, upon the written request of the Seller, provide the
Seller (or another designated Selling Party) with one or more loans (the "Buyer
DIP Facility") in an aggregate amount not to exceed $5,000,000 at any one time
outstanding; provided that (a) the obligation of Classic to enter into the Buyer
DIP Facility and provide loans thereunder shall be subject to execution of
documentation reasonably satisfactory to Classic, (b) Classic shall not be
obligated to provide any loans under the Buyer DIP Facility prior to the entry
of an order by the Bankruptcy Court reasonably acceptable to Classic, (c) the
terms of the Buyer DIP Facility shall provide that all amounts outstanding
thereunder shall be due and payable upon the earlier to occur of (i) December
31, 2001 and (ii) the Closing Date, (d) the interest rate for loans under the
Buyer DIP Facility shall be the "Prime Rate" (as defined in the DIP Facility)
plus 3.00% and (e) the obligations of the Selling Parties under the Buyer DIP
Facility will be subordinate only to the obligations of the Selling Parties
under the DIP Facility, and will be secured by a Lien on substantially all of
the assets of the Selling Parties, which Lien shall be junior in priority only
to the Liens granted pursuant to the DIP Facility. Upon the Closing, the
obligations of the Selling Parties under the Buyer DIP Facility shall be
satisfied


                                      -48-

<PAGE>


upon the payment of the Cash Purchase Price (as reduced pursuant to clause (dd)
of the definition of "Cash Purchase Price").

     5.14. Certain Payments.

          (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Selling Parties shall pay, promptly
     when due, all amounts in respect of royalties and profit participations
     owing under each of the Contractual Obligations listed in the exhibit to
     the agreement referred to in Section 6.1(d) of the Disclosure Schedule;
     provided, however, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
     the Seller's failure to fulfill this covenant (i) shall not, in and of
     itself, serve as a basis for the Buyer terminating this Agreement and (ii)
     shall entitle the Buyer to the reduction in the Cash Purchase Price
     described in subsection (bb) of the definition thereof.

          (b) Intentionally Deleted.

          (c) Nothing contained in this Section 5.14 shall be construed to limit
     the obligations of the Selling Parties in Section 5.1.

          (d) Insurance Matters. With respect to each of the insurance policies
     listed in Section 3.17 of the Disclosure Schedule that do not constitute
     Seller Insurance (other than the insurance policies covering director and
     officer liability), the Seller shall, upon request by the Buyer, use
     commercially reasonable efforts to have the Buyer named as an additional
     named insured, to the extent permitted under the terms of such policies.

     material respects as of the Closing Date.

          (b) Performance by the Seller and its Subsidiaries. The Seller and its

     resulted in, or that would reasonably be expected to result in, a Material
     Adverse Effect, provided that any change, circumstance or event of the type
     described in Exhibit H shall not constitute a Material Adverse Effect for
     purposes of this Section 6.1(c).

     transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) cause any of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be rescinded following
     consummation, or (iii) have a material adverse effect on the right of the
     Buyer to own the Acquired Assets or to operate the Business (and no such
     injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling, or charge shall be in effect).

          (f) Absence of Other Legal Prohibition. There shall not be any other
     legal restriction that would make consummation of the transactions
     contemplated hereby illegal or would otherwise have, or be reasonably
     likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

     form reasonably acceptable to the Buyer. The Selling Parties shall have
     filed one or more affidavits or certificates of such service with the
     Bankruptcy Court in the Case (the "Affidavits of Service").

          (h) Bankruptcy Court Action. The Bankruptcy Court shall have entered
     the Approval Order in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit G (the "Approval

     Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise of all of the Contractual
     Obligations included in the Acquired Assets, find void and unenforceable
     any provision which prohibits, restricts or conditions the assignment of
     any of the Contractual Obligations included in the Acquired Assets and/or

     Obligations as between Random House, Inc. and Classic, and find that the
     time to assume such Contractual Obligations has not expired and that such
     Contractual Obligations are in full force and effect and free from default
     (other than for cure amounts), and (vi) shall not impose upon the Buyer any
     financial obligation to provide "adequate assurances" (as such term is used

     Contractual Obligation assigned pursuant to this Agreement. The Approval
     Order shall be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
     Buyer, and the Approval Order shall be a final order which is not subject
     to any appeal and/or which has not been reversed, modified, rescinded, or

     Parties.

The Selling Parties may waive any condition specified in this Section 6.2 if
they execute a writing so stating at or prior to the Closing and such waiver
shall not be considered a waiver of any other provision in this Agreement unless
such writing specifically so states.

7. Confidentiality.
   ----------------

     The Seller and each of its Subsidiaries will treat and hold as confidential
all of the Confidential Information, will refrain from using or disclosing to
any Person any of the Confidential Information, and, after the Closing, will
deliver promptly to the Buyer or, at the request and option of the Buyer,
destroy all tangible embodiments and all copies of any Confidential Information
(and certify such destruction to the Buyer) which is in his, her or its
possession other than such information as constitutes an Excluded Asset or
relates solely to an Excluded Asset or Retained Liability; provided that, prior
to the Closing, the Selling Parties may use and disclose Confidential
Information (i) to any other Selling Party, or their respective employees,
advisors, accountants, designees and representatives in the Ordinary Course of
Business and with such protections and agreements concerning the obligation to
treat and hold such information as confidential as are consistent with the
practices of the Selling Parties prior to the Execution Date and (ii) to the
Buyer and the Buyer's counsel, accountants and representatives in connection
with this Agreement. In the event that the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries
is requested or required (by oral question or request for information or
documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative
demand, or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, such Party
will notify the Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that the Buyer
may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance


                                      -53-

<PAGE>


with the provisions of this Section 7. If, in the absence of a protective order
or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries
is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information
to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, that Party may disclose the
Confidential Information to the tribunal; provided, however, that the disclosing
Party shall use his, her or its reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request and
expense of the Buyer, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as the Buyer shall designate.

8. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated as follows:
   -----------

     8.1. Mutual Agreement. The Parties may terminate this Agreement by mutual
written consent at any time prior to the Closing (which such consent shall be
signed by each Party hereto and effective when so signed).

     8.2. Certain Seller Non-Compliance. The Buyer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement in any of the following events: (i) in the event the
Seller and its Subsidiaries shall fail to make their pre-merger notification
filing with the Federal Trade Commission no later than the first business day
after the date the Approval Order is entered by the Bankruptcy Court (or, if the
Approval Order is entered prior to August 8, 2001, no later than August 8,
2001), or shall otherwise fail to comply in any material respect with any of the
terms and provisions of Section 5.4 hereof; and (ii) in the event the Bankruptcy
Court shall fail to enter the Approval Order in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit G in all material respects within 60 days after the Execution Date
(calculated in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 9006). Any notice of termination
under this Section 8.2 may be sent by the Buyer to the Seller by facsimile, c/o
Philip Galanes, Esq., (212) 547-6771, and shall be effective when so sent;
provided, however, that in the case of any termination by the Buyer pursuant to
this Section 8.2, the Buyer shall exercise its right to terminate this Agreement
not later than five business days after the delivery of notice by the Seller to
the Buyer in accordance with Section 11.9 stating that an event identified in
this Section 8.2 has occurred.

     8.3. Certain Buyer Rights to Terminate. The Buyer may terminate this
Agreement by giving written notice to the Selling Parties at any time prior to
the Closing in any of the following events (which such notice shall be made and
effective as provided in Section 11.9 hereof): (i) in the event there shall have
been any change, circumstance or event which constitutes or has resulted in, or
that would reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect, at
any time since July 25, 2001 (provided that any change, circumstance or event of
the type described in Exhibit H shall not constitute a Material Adverse Effect
for purposes of this Section 8.3(i)), and the Buyer is not entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2 or sub-sections (ii) and (iii) of this
Section 8.3; (ii) in the event the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries has
breached any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement
(other than as set forth in Sections 5.14(a), 10.8(e) and 10.8(g)) the result of
which breach is to cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(a) or (b) not
to be satisfied (provided that any failure by any Selling Party to provide the
notice required pursuant to Section 5.3 shall only be deemed a breach of the
representation or warranty with respect to which such notice should have been
made); or (iii) in the event the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
December 31, 2001, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under
Section 6.1 hereof (unless the failure


                                      -54-

<PAGE>


results primarily from the breach by the Buyer of any representation, warranty,
or covenant contained in this Agreement).

     8.4. Certain Seller Rights to Terminate. The Selling Parties, acting
jointly, may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Buyer at
any time prior to the Closing in any of the following events (which such notice
shall be made and effective as provided in Section 11.9 hereof): (i) in the
event the Buyer has breached any representation, warranty, or covenant contained
in this Agreement the result of which breach is to cause the conditions set
forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b) not to be satisfied (provided that any failure by
the Buyer to provide the notice required pursuant to Section 5.3 shall only be
deemed a breach of the representation or warranty with respect to which such
notice should have been made); or (ii) in the event the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before December 31, 2001, by reason of the failure of any
condition precedent under Section 6.2 hereof (unless the failure results
primarily from the breach by the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries of any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement). A
termination pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 8.4 is referred to herein as
a "Buyer Default Termination".

9. Liabilities in the Event of Termination.
   ----------------------------------------

     9.1. Intentionally Deleted.

     9.2. Expense Reimbursement. Subject to the proviso in the last sentence of
this Section 9.2, in the event that either (a) this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Sections 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3 of this Agreement (each, an "Expense
Termination Event") or (b) the Case is dismissed or converted to a Chapter 7
proceeding, or a plan of reorganization is filed, then neither the Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates or representatives shall have any Liability hereunder to the
Seller and its Subsidiaries and, to the exclusion of any other remedies the
Buyer may have (other than those provided under Sections 9.1 and 9.4) against
the Seller and any of its Affiliates, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer, all
reasonable documented out-of-pocket costs and fees and expenses incurred by the
Buyer, or by its Affiliates, in connection with the due diligence review of the
Business, negotiation and documentation of this Agreement and other actions
taken in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby incurred at any
time from and after April 30, 2001, including (i) reimbursement of all filing
fees paid in connection with filings under the HSR Act, and (ii) reimbursement
of all fees and expenses paid to the Buyer's lawyers, accountants and other
professional or financial advisers, and its lenders or other potential financing
sources (including commitment fees, and fees and expenses of such lenders' or
other potential financing sources' lawyers, accountants and other professional
advisors); provided that (A) such costs, fees, and expenses shall be subject to
Bankruptcy Court approval (as to reasonableness), (B) none of the foregoing fees
shall be reimbursable to the extent such fees were paid or are payable to any
Affiliate of the Buyer (it being understood that out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by such Affiliates shall be reimbursable) and (C) the
aggregate amount of such reimbursement pursuant to this Section 9.2 shall not,
in any event, exceed an aggregate of $1,000,000 (the "Expense Reimbursement").
The Expense Reimbursement payable by the Seller to the Buyer hereunder shall be
paid in immediately available funds immediately upon the earlier to occur of (a)
the occurrence of an Expense Termination Event and (b) the effective date of a
reorganization plan filed by the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that the foregoing Expense Reimbursement obligations in this
Section 9.2 shall not apply if the Buyer had


                                      -55-

<PAGE>


previously terminated this Agreement solely because the condition set forth in
Section 6.1(d) was not satisfied with respect to any particular Contractual
Obligation as a result of the Bankruptcy Court denial of a motion to assume and
assign any such Contractual Obligation on the ground that there was not adequate
assurance of future performance by the Buyer (as assignee) as required by
Bankruptcy Code Section 365(f)(2)(B) (a "Specified Buyer Termination").

     9.3. Termination by Reason of Buyer Default. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to a Specified Buyer Termination or pursuant to Section 8.4
by reason of a Buyer Default Termination, then neither the Selling Parties nor
any of their respective Affiliates or representatives shall have any Liability
hereunder to the Buyer, and the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller and any
of its Affiliates shall be strictly limited to retention of the Acquired Assets
and the Deposit. In no event shall the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
representatives have any Liability to the Seller and any of its Affiliates
hereunder other than as provided in the immediately preceding sentence in the
event this Agreement terminates as a result of a Buyer Default Termination, and
any claim, right or cause of action by the Seller and any of its Affiliates
against the Buyer or its Affiliates or representatives other than as provided in
immediately preceding sentence is hereby fully waived, released and forever
discharged. In no event shall any Party or its respective Affiliates or
representatives have any Liability to any other Party for special, consequential
or punitive damages, and any claim, right or cause of action or for any damages
that are special, consequential or punitive or for specific performance of this
Agreement is hereby fully waived, released and forever discharged.

     9.4. Return of Deposit. Upon any termination of this Agreement for any
reason (other than by reason of a Buyer Default Termination or a Specified Buyer
Termination), the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Buyer the Deposit (together
with any interest earned thereon). Upon termination of this Agreement by the
Seller as a result of a Buyer Default Termination or a Specified Buyer
Termination, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Seller the Deposit (together
with any interest earned thereon).

The Selling Parties and the Buyer agree that (i) the amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 9 are commercially reasonable and necessary to induce the Buyer to
enter into and consummate the transactions between the Buyer and the Selling
Parties contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) such amounts are the sole and
exclusive remedy prior to Closing for any breach of a representation, warranty
or covenant.

10. Additional Obligations.
    -----------------------

     10.1. Further Assurances. At any time and from time to time after the
Closing, at the request and expense of the Buyer and without further
consideration, the Seller and its Subsidiaries will execute and deliver such
other instruments of transfer, and provide testimony by affidavit or other
appropriate means, and take such other action as the Buyer may reasonably
request to transfer to the Buyer (or its designee), and to confirm the Buyer's
(or its designee's, the case may be) title to or interest in, the Acquired
Assets, assist the Buyer at the Buyer's expense in exercising all rights with
respect thereto, and consummate the other transactions contemplated hereby.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if after the Closing any third
party shall be found to possess any Acquired Asset of which the Buyer is
entitled to possession by virtue of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Seller and its


                                      -56-

<PAGE>


Subsidiaries shall take all commercially reasonable steps to cause such Acquired
Assets to be furnished and delivered to the Buyer or its designees.

     10.2. Financial Statements. At any time and from time to time, after the
Closing Date, at the reasonable request of the Buyer and without further
consideration, the Selling Parties will fully cooperate with the Buyer to
provide accounting or financial information concerning the Business, the
Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, in connection with the preparation
of any audited financial statements in accordance with Regulation S-X
promulgated under the Securities Act.

     10.3. Change of Corporate Name; Domain Names. The Selling Parties agree
that, promptly after the Closing, they will file such certificates or other
documents at their own expense and to take such other actions as are necessary
in order to effectuate a change of name to new names bearing no resemblance to
their present names and to change the caption of the Case. The Buyer is hereby
authorized to file such certificates or other documents in order to effectuate
such changes of name after the Closing as the Buyer shall elect if any of the
Selling Parties fails to comply with the preceding sentence within 30 days after
the Closing. With respect to each Internet domain name currently registered in
the name of any of the Selling Parties or any of their respective predecessors
in interest or divisions or any other names under which any Selling Party
conducts or has conducted business (collectively, the "Domain Names"), none of
the Selling Parties, from and after the Closing Date, (x) will e-mail or
otherwise deliver the deletion template to Network Solutions, Inc., (y) will
otherwise delete, any Domain Name, or (z) will register with any registrar any
Internet domain name which is confusingly similar to the Domain Names.

     10.4. Tax Cooperation. From and after the Closing, each of the Parties
hereto shall provide such necessary information as any other Party hereto may
reasonably request at the requesting Party's expense in connection with the
preparation of such Party's Tax Returns, or to respond to or contest any audit,
prosecute any claim for refund or credit or to otherwise satisfy any legal
requirement relating to Taxes of the Seller and its Subsidiaries or the
Business.

     10.5. Certain Taxes.

          (a) Unless otherwise exempt under section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy
     Code, all state and local sales, transfer, transfer gains, excise,
     value-added or other similar taxes, including all state and local taxes in
     connection with the transfer of the Acquired Assets that may be imposed by
     reason of the sale, transfer, assignment and delivery of the Acquired
     Assets shall be borne by the Seller. The Buyer agrees to take such actions
     and to execute such certificates and other documents as from time to time
     shall be reasonably requested by the Seller in order to minimize the amount
     of any taxes described in the first sentence of this Section 10.5(a).

          (b) The Seller shall, on or before the Closing, deliver to the Buyer a
     certificate issued by the Minister of National Revenue of Canada pursuant
     to Section 116 of the Income Tax Act (Canada), the effect of which is to
     prevent the imposition of Liability on the Buyer for any Canadian income
     taxes, interest or penalties or additions thereto, in respect of the
     proposed disposition by the Selling Parties of any Acquired Assets


                                      -57-

<PAGE>


     ("Canadian Taxes"), the disposition of which is subject to Canadian Taxes
     (a "Section 116 Certificate"). In the event that the Section 116
     Certificate has not been delivered to the Buyer on or before the Closing,
     the Buyer will be entitled to withhold and remit to Canadian taxing
     authorities a portion of the Purchase Price, the withholding and remittance
     of which would, in the Buyer's reasonable judgment, be sufficient to
     reimburse the Buyer for its obligations to withhold in respect of, and
     otherwise satisfy any Liability for, any or all Canadian Taxes. In any case
     where the Buyer withholds and remits any amount pursuant to this section,
     the Buyer shall be deemed to have paid such amount to the Seller as part of
     the Purchase Price.

     10.6. Transfer of Certain Funds Received Post-Closing. With respect to any
and all amounts received or collected by any of the Selling Parties from and
after the Closing (a) attributable to, or in respect of, any of the Works,
Marks, Copyrights, any accounts receivable of the Seller and/or any of its
Subsidiaries or any other Acquired Asset, and (b) which become the property of
the Buyer as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Selling Parties shall provide notice of such receipt or
collection to the Buyer and pay promptly (and in any event within five business
days of their receipt or collection) to the Buyer any and all such amounts so
received or collected by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified by the Buyer or by other means acceptable to the Buyer.


     10.7. Expenses. Except as contemplated by Sections 2.5(b) and 9.2, each
Party will bear his, her or its own costs and expenses (including legal and
accounting fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby whether or not consummated.

     10.8. Employees.

          (a) While the Selling Parties shall be under no obligation to
     terminate the employment of any person employed by any of the Selling
     Parties (each, a "Business Employee"), the Buyer will not assume any
     obligations or liabilities for any of the Business Employees, other than
     Liabilities under Acquired Contracts (specifically, the employment
     agreements between the Seller and each of Richard Snyder, Philip Galanes
     and Colin Finkelstein, which agreements are being assumed by Classic).
     However, the Buyer will, separate and apart from any obligations the
     Selling Parties have, provide for the Business Employees (other than
     Messrs. Snyder, Galanes and Finkelstein) after the Closing Date in one of
     the following two ways, in the Buyer's sole discretion: the Buyer will (x)
     offer employment to such Business Employees at substantially the same base
     remuneration that such employee received immediately prior to Closing; or
     (y) if and to the extent that any such Business Employee is not offered
     employment by the Buyer, such Business Employee shall receive, if and to
     the extent not covered by any severance payments actually made by the
     Selling Parties, as a transition payment from the Buyer, a cash payment
     equal to two weeks' regular base salary for each year of service by such
     Business Employee with the Seller, subject to a maximum payment hereunder
     of $80,000 for each such Business Employee.

          (b) Intentionally Deleted.


                                      -58-

<PAGE>


          (c) Intentionally Deleted.

          (d) Intentionally Deleted.

          (e) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall have paid in cash in full
     all bonuses of any kind or nature with respect to any fiscal year prior to
     the 2001 fiscal year that, as of December 31, 2000, had been earned by any
     employee of the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries but that have not
     been paid as of the Execution Date, in each case funded solely pursuant to
     the DIP Facility contemplated by Section 5.1(b)(i) or capital contributions
     made after the Execution Date; provided, however, that notwithstanding
     anything herein to the contrary, the Seller's failure to fulfill this
     covenant (i) shall not serve as a basis for the Buyer terminating this
     Agreement and (ii) shall entitle the Buyer to the reduction in the Cash
     Purchase Price described in subsection (bb) of the definition thereof.

          (f) The Seller shall pay in cash any and all severance payments
     arising prior to the Closing Date in full as and when due to any employee
     of the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries entitled to such payments, in
     each case funded solely pursuant to the DIP Facility contemplated by
     Section 5.1(b)(i) or capital contributions made after the Execution Date.
     The Seller shall not amend any such severance arrangements on or before the
     Closing Date in a manner adverse to the Buyer.

          (g) Prior to the Petition Date, the Seller shall have paid in cash in
     full all sales commissions of any kind or nature with respect to any fiscal
     year prior to the 2001 fiscal year that, as of December 31, 2000, had been
     earned by any employee of the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries but
     that have been not paid as of the Petition Date; provided, however, that
     notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Seller's failure to
     fulfill this covenant (i) shall not serve as a basis for the Buyer
     terminating this Agreement and (ii) shall entitle the Buyer to the
     reduction in the Cash Purchase Price described in subsection (bb) of the
     definition thereof.

     10.9. Notices and Access Letters. Promptly after the Closing, the Seller
shall execute and deliver to each of the Persons listed in Section 3.5(b)(ii) of
the Disclosure Schedule a Notice and Acknowledgment of Transfer substantially in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit K and shall use reasonable commercial
efforts to obtain an "access letter" or similar document from each such third
party permitting the Buyer or its authorized representatives or agents to have
physical access to any Acquired Asset in the possession of such third party (or
its agents). To the extent the Seller has not executed and delivered such Notice
and Acknowledgment of Transfer to the Persons listed in Section 3.5(b)(ii) of
the Disclosure Schedule and obtained such access letters or similar documents
within 10 business days after the Closing, the Seller hereby authorizes the
Buyer to execute and deliver on behalf and in the name of the Seller such Notice
and Acknowledgment of Transfer to such Persons and to obtain such access letters
or similar documents.

rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

     11.2. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents referred to
herein) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes any
prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or between the Parties
or their respective Affiliates, written or oral, to the extent they related in
any way to the subject matter hereof.

     11.3. Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other Party; provided, however, that: (i) the Buyer may assign any or all
of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates and
designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder
(provided that no such assignment or designation shall relieve the Buyer of its
obligations hereunder and provided, further, that no such assignment or
designation shall be made if the result thereof would be to render the Closing
more difficult to effect), (ii) the Buyer shall allocate and apportion, as
between the two entities constituting the Buyer and their respective Affiliates,
the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities as described in Exhibit D-8, which
Exhibit shall be provided by the Buyer no later than one day following the
Execution Date, and (iii) the Buyer and its Affiliates may assign all or any
portion of their rights hereunder to any of their respective lenders as
security.

     11.4. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the
Buyer and the Selling Parties and no waiver of any right under this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Person
against whom enforcement of such waiver is sought. No waiver by any Party of any
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence.

     11.5. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of law or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. The
Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Section 11.5 shall
in any way limit, restrict or impair the right of the Buyer or the Seller to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Section 8 hereof
whereupon the provisions of Section 9 hereof shall take effect according to
their terms.

     11.6. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.

     11.7. Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

     11.8. Waivers Under Indiana Law. The Buyer represents and warrants that the
Buyer is aware of the purpose and intent of the disclosure document required
under the Indiana Responsible Property Transfer Law, Indiana Code 13-25-3, and
hereby waives delivery of disclosure documents at least thirty (30) days prior
to the transfer of the Crawfordsville Facilities from the Seller or its
Subsidiaries to the Buyer. The Buyer agrees that no disclosure document shall be
required to be completed by the Seller or its Subsidiaries to the extent the
Crawfordsville Facilities do not fall within the definition of "property" for
purposes of Indiana Code 13-25-3, or if the Seller and its Subsidiaries are not
required by law to provide the disclosure document.

     11.9. Notices. All notices, requests, demands, claims, and other
communications hereunder will be in writing. Other than the notice referred to
in Section 8.2 (for which the procedures specified in such section shall
govern), any notice, request, demand, claim, or other communication hereunder
shall be deemed duly given (i) upon electronic confirmation of facsimile, (ii)

Any Party may send any notice, request, demand, claim, or other communication
hereunder to the intended recipient at the address set forth above using any
other means (including personal delivery, expedited courier, messenger service,
telecopy, telex, ordinary mail, or electronic mail), but no such notice,

other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other Party
notice in the manner herein set forth.

     11.10. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic laws of the State of New York without giving effect
to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New
York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of
any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

     11.11. Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this


                                      -62-

<PAGE>


Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by
virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. The word
"including" shall mean including without limitation. Definitions are equally
applicable to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined, and
references to the masculine, feminine or neuter gender include each other
gender. The words "hereof", "herein", "hereunder" and words of similar import
shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or
provision of this Agreement, and reference to a particular section of this
Agreement shall include all subsections thereof. It is expressly agreed and
understood that time shall be considered of the essence in connection with the
performance of the respective agreements, covenants and obligations hereunder of
each Party hereto. Neither the listing nor description of any item, matter or
document in any Section of the Disclosure Schedule nor the furnishing or
availability for review of any document shall be construed to modify, qualify or
disclose an exception to any representation or warranty of any Party made herein
or in connection herewith, except to the extent that such modification,
qualification or exception is described in the section of the Disclosure
Schedule corresponding to such representation or warranty or such section of the
Disclosure Schedule specifically cross-references another section of the
Disclosure Schedule in which such modification, qualification or exception is
described. The Parties intend that each representation, warranty, and covenant
contained herein shall have independent significance. If any Party has breached
any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any respect, the
fact that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating to
the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which
the Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant. All
covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of a Party made herein and
in the certificates, exhibits and schedules hereto shall be deemed to have been
relied on by the other Parties hereto, notwithstanding any investigation made by
or on behalf of any of the Parties or any opportunity therefor or any
constructive knowledge thereby obtained.

     11.12. Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules. The Exhibits and Schedules
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof.

     11.13. Bankruptcy Court Jurisdiction. THE BUYER AND THE SELLING PARTIES
AGREE THAT THE BANKRUPTCY COURT SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION DURING THE
CASE OVER ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE BUYER AND THE SELLING PARTIES, AND SHALL
OTHERWISE HAVE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ALL DISPUTES AND MATTERS, IN EACH
EVENT RELATING TO ANY OF (i) THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY DOCUMENT EXECUTED PURSUANT HERETO AND/OR (ii) THE
ACQUIRED ASSETS AND/OR ASSUMED LIABILITIES, AND THE BUYER AND EACH OF THE
SELLING PARTIES EACH EXPRESSLY CONSENTS TO SUCH JURISDICTION.

     11.14. Survival. The representations and warranties contained in Sections 3
and 4 of this Agreement shall not survive the Closing. The covenants of the
Parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing, except that the
covenants contained in Section 5.3 shall not survive the Closing.
