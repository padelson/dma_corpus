AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this " _Agreement_ ")
dated as of June 9, 2017, is by and between Carolina Financial Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (" _Carolina Financial_ "), and First South Bancorp,
Inc., a Virginia corporation (" _First South_ "). Except as otherwise set
forth herein, capitalized and certain other terms used herein shall have the
meanings set forth in Section 10.1 of this Agreement.

  



  

 _RECITALS_

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Carolina Financial and First
South have determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective companies and shareholders for Carolina Financial to acquire First
South pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and have unanimously approved
the merger of First South with and into Carolina Financial, with Carolina
Financial being the surviving entity (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby the issued and
outstanding shares of First South Common Stock will be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration from Carolina Financial;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Carolina Financial has adopted this
Agreement, duly authorized the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and resolved to recommend that Carolina Financial's
stockholders approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of First South has adopted this Agreement,
duly authorized the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, and resolved to recommend that First South's shareholders approve
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger;

  



  

WHEREAS, it is intended that, immediately following the Merger, or as soon as
is practicable thereafter, First South Bank, a North Carolina bank and wholly-
owned subsidiary of First South, will be merged with and into CresCom Bank, a
South Carolina banking corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Carolina
Financial, so that CresCom Bank is the surviving bank;

  



  

WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, Carolina Financial and First South desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in connection with
the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual warranties,
representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, and other good
and valuable consideration and the receipt and sufficiency of which are
acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

  



  

Article 1 
 TRANSACTIONS AND TERMS OF MERGER

   | 1.1| _Merger._ 
---|---|--- 
  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
First South shall be merged with and into Carolina Financial pursuant to
and with the effect provided in Section 252 of the DGCL and Section 13.1-716
of the VSCA, and Carolina Financial shall be the Surviving Corporation
resulting from the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the Laws of the
State of Delaware. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence
of First South shall cease. The Merger shall be consummated pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, which has been approved and adopted by the
respective Boards of Directors of Carolina Financial and First South.

  



  

   


--- 

 



    



   | 1.2| _Time and Place of Closing._ 
---|---|--- 
  

The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 12:01 A.M. Eastern Time on the date that the Effective Time
occurs (the " _Effective Date_ "), or at such other time as the Parties,
acting through their authorized officers, may mutually agree. The Closing
shall be held at such location as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties
and may be effected by electronic or other transmission of signature pages,
as mutually agreed upon.

  



   | 1.3| _Effective Time._ 
---|---|--- 
  

 The Merger shall be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger reflecting the Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") and Articles of Merger reflecting the Merger with the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the " _Articles of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective (the " _Effective Time_ ") when the Certificate of Merger and Articles of Merger have been filed or at such later time as may be mutually agreed upon by Carolina Financial and First South and specified in the Certificate of Merger and Articles of Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by the authorized officers of each Party, the Parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur within 10 business days after the last of the following dates to occur: (i) the effective date (including expiration of any applicable waiting period) of the last required Consent of any Regulatory Authority having authority over and approving or exempting the Merger, (ii) the date on which the shareholders of First South approve this Agreement; and (iii) the date on which the stockholders of Carolina Financial approve this Agreement.

  



   | 1.4| _Restructure of Transaction._ 
---|---|--- 
  

Carolina Financial shall have the right to revise the structure of the Merger
contemplated by this Agreement by merging First South with and into a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Carolina Financial, _provided,_ that no such revision to
the structure of the Merger (i) shall result in any changes in the amount or
type of the consideration which the holders of shares of First South Common
Stock are entitled to receive under this Agreement, (ii) would unreasonably
impede or delay consummation of the Merger, or (iii) imposes any less
favorable terms or conditions on First South or First South Bank. In such
event, Carolina Financial will give written notice to First South in the
manner provided in Section 10.8, which notice shall be in the form of an
amendment to this Agreement, in the form of a proposed amendment to this
Agreement, or in the form of an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of
Merger and Reorganization, and the addition of such other exhibits hereto as
are reasonably necessary or appropriate to effect such change.

  



   | 1.5| _Bank Merger; Directors and Officers of the Surviving Bank._ 
---|---|--- 
  

(a)  Concurrently with or as soon as practicable after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, CresCom Bank and First South Bank
shall enter into the Bank Agreement of Merger, in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ , with such changes thereto as Carolina Financial and First South
mutually agree to, pursuant to which First South Bank will merge with and into
CresCom Bank (the " _Bank Merger_ "), with CresCom Bank as the surviving
institution (the " _Surviving Bank_ "). The Parties intend that the Bank
Merger will become effective simultaneously with or immediately following the
Effective Time.

  

   

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)  The Bank Agreement of Merger shall provide that the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Bank shall be the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of CresCom Bank as in effect immediately
prior to the Bank Merger until otherwise duly amended or repealed.

  

(c)  The Bank Agreement of Merger shall provide that the
directors of the Surviving Bank shall be the directors of CresCom
Bank serving immediately prior to the Bank Merger from and after the
effective time of the Bank Merger, in accordance with the Surviving Bank's
Bylaws, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing
to be a director. Prior to the effective time of the Bank Merger, CresCom
Bank shall take all action necessary to appoint Bruce W. Elder as a director
of the Surviving Bank, to be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the next business
day following the effective time of the Bank Merger, and to cause Mr. Elder
to be nominated as a board nominee for re-election by the shareholders at the
next annual meeting of shareholders of the Surviving Bank following his
appointment to the Board of Directors of the Surviving Bank. It is anticipated
that the directors of First South Bank in office immediately prior to the
effective time of the Bank Merger, other than Mr. Elder, shall serve as the
Surviving Bank's Eastern North Carolina Advisory Board and shall be entitled
to receive a fee of $500.00 for each advisory board meeting attended. The
Surviving Bank's Eastern North Carolina Advisory Board is expected to meet no
less than three times per year.

  

(d)   The Bank Agreement of Merger shall provide that the
officers of the Surviving Bank shall be the officers of CresCom Bank serving
immediately prior to the Bank Merger, together with such additional persons as
may hereafter be appointed, from and after the effective time of the Bank
Merger in accordance with the Surviving Bank's Bylaws, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an officer.
Concurrently with or as soon as practicable after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each of Bruce W. Elder, who shall be the
President of North Carolina Banking of the Surviving Bank, and Cornelius F.
Sullivan, who shall be the Senior Vice President and Raleigh Area Executive of
the Surviving Bank, shall enter into employment agreements in the forms
attached hereto as _Exhibits H and I_ , respectively, which shall become
effective only upon the Effective Time.

  

1.6   _Tax Treatment of the Merger._

  



  

It is intended by the Parties that the Merger constitute a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties hereby adopt
this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). All of the Parties agree to
cooperate and use their best efforts in order to qualify the transactions
contemplated herein as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the
Code, to not take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause the
Merger to fail to so qualify, and to report the Merger for federal, state and
any local income Tax purposes in a manner consistent with such
characterization.

---|---|---

to be a director. Prior to the Effective Time, Carolina Financial shall take
all action necessary to appoint a representative of First South's board
of directors, as mutually agreed upon by First South and Carolina Financial,
as a Class II director and a representative of First South's board of
directors, as mutually agreed upon by First South and Carolina Financial, as a
Class III director of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation ,
to be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the next business day following the
Effective Time, and to cause such representatives to be nominated as board
nominees for election by the stockholders to the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Corporation at the next annual meeting of stockholders of the
Surviving Corporation at which such director's class is nominated for re-
election following their appointment to the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of Carolina Financial in office
immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with such additional persons
as may hereafter be appointed, shall serve as the officers of the Surviving
Corporation from and after the Effective Time in accordance with
the Surviving Corporation's Bylaws, until the earlier of their resignation or

Article 3 
 MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES

   | 3.1| _Effect on First South Common Stock._ 
---|---|--- 
  

(a)  At the Effective Time, in each case subject to Sections
3.1(b), 3.1(c), 3.1(d) and 3.1(f), by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Parties, each share of First South Common Stock that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
the Extinguished Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.5200
shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of Carolina Financial Common Stock (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

  

(b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and
notwithstanding the approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of
Carolina Financial and/or the shareholders of First South, the Exchange Ratio
shall be decreased as set forth in Section 3.1(c) if (A) the Carolina
Financial Average Closing Price is greater than $35.14, and (B) (x) the number
obtained by dividing the Carolina Financial Average Closing Price by the
Initial Price (the " _Closing Price Change Ratio_ ") is more than 0.15
greater than (y) the number obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the
Initial Index Price (the " _Index Change Ratio_ ").

  

(c)  If the conditions of Section 3.1(b) are satisfied, the
Exchange Ratio shall become the ratio obtained by multiplying (A) the
quotient of the Per Share Purchase Price divided by the Carolina Final Average
Closing Price by (B) the sum of the Index Change Ratio plus 0.15.

  

(d)  At the Effective Time, all shares of First South Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each
certificate previously representing any such shares of First South Common
Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and each non-certificated share of First South
Common Stock (the " _First South Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive applicable payments as set forth in
Section 3.8.

  

   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(e)  If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
First South Common Stock, First South Options, or the outstanding shares of
Carolina Financial Common Stock or any rights with respect to Carolina
Financial Common Stock pursuant to stock options or other equity-based awards
granted by Carolina Financial under the Carolina Financial Corporation 2013
Equity Incentive Plan (the " _Carolina Financial Awards_ ") shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or
kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse
stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, then an appropriate
and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Per Share Purchase Price.
For the avoidance of doubt, Carolina Financial shall have the right to grant
additional Carolina Financial Awards prior to the Effective Date under the
Carolina Financial Corporation 2013 Equity Incentive Plan without
triggering an adjustment to the Per Share Purchase Price under this Section
3.1(e).

  

(f)  Each share of First South Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by either of
the Parties or their respective Subsidiaries (in each case other than shares
of First South Common Stock held on behalf of third parties or as a result of
debts previously contracted) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor, and
shall cease to exist (the " _Extinguished Shares_ ").

   | 3.2| _Exchange Procedures._ 
---|---|--- 
  

(a)  Promptly after the Effective Time, Carolina Financial
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this
Section 3.2, the Merger Consideration and cash in an aggregate amount
sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares of Carolina Financial
Common Stock to which holders of First South Common Stock may be entitled
pursuant to Section 3.6 (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event
the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of
the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Carolina
Financial shall promptly make available to the Exchange Agent the amounts so
required to satisfy such payment obligations in full. The Exchange Agent shall
deliver the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Carolina Financial Common Stock out of the Exchange Fund. Except
as contemplated by this Section 3.2 and Section 3.6, the Exchange Fund will
not be used for any other purpose.

  

(b)  Unless different timing is agreed to by Carolina
Financial and First South, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, but in any event no more than seven business days after
the Effective Time, Carolina Financial shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to the former shareholders of First South appropriate transmittal materials
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or other instruments theretofore representing shares
of First South Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificates or other instruments to the Exchange Agent). In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of First South Common Stock represented by one
or more Certificates or First South Book-Entry Shares that are not registered
in the transfer records of First South, the Merger Consideration payable for
such shares as provided in Section 3.1 may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate or Certificates or First South Book-Entry Shares representing
such shares are delivered to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence such transfer and by evidence reasonably satisfactory to
the Exchange Agent that such transfer is proper and that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. In the event any Certificate or First South
Book-Entry Shares representing First South Common Stock shall have been lost,
mutilated, stolen, destroyed or are otherwise missing, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate or First South
Book-Entry Shares to be lost, stolen, mutilated, destroyed or otherwise
missing and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of
a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or Carolina Financial with
respect to such Certificate or First South Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, mutilated, stolen, or destroyed
Certificate or First South Book-Entry Shares the Merger Consideration as
provided for in Section 3.1. The Exchange Agent may establish such other
reasonable and customary rules and procedures in connection with its duties
as it may deem appropriate. Carolina Financial shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent in connection with the
distribution of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1. Carolina
Financial or its Exchange Agent will maintain a book entry list of Carolina
Financial Common Stock to which each former holder of First South Common
Stock is entitled. Certificates evidencing Carolina Financial Common Stock
into which First South Common Stock has been converted will not be issued.

  

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(c)  Unless different timing is agreed to by Carolina Financial
and First South, after the Effective Time, each holder of shares of First
South Common Stock (other than Extinguished Shares) issued and outstanding at
the Effective Time shall surrender the Certificate or Certificates or First
South Book-Entry Shares representing such shares to the Exchange Agent and
shall promptly upon surrender thereof receive in exchange therefor the
consideration provided in Section 3.1, without interest, pursuant to this
Section 3.2. The Certificate or Certificates of First South Common Stock so
surrendered shall be duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require. Carolina Financial shall not be obligated to deliver the
Merger Consideration to which any former holder of First South Common Stock
is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders such
holder's Certificate or Certificates or First South Book-Entry Shares (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.2(b)) for exchange
as provided in this Section 3.2. Similarly, no dividends or other
distributions in respect of the Carolina Financial Common Stock shall be paid
to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Certificates or First South
Book-Entry Shares until such Certificate or Certificates or First South Book-
Entry Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
3.2(b)) are surrendered for exchange as provided in this Section 3.2. Any
other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, neither any Carolina
Financial Entities, nor any First South Entities, nor the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any holder of First South Common Stock for any amounts
paid or properly delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Law.

  

(d)  Each of Carolina Financial and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of First South Common Stock
and First South Options such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law or by any Taxing Authority or
Governmental Authority. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld by
Carolina Financial, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of First South
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Carolina Financial, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

  

(e)  Any portion of the Merger Consideration and cash delivered
to the Exchange Agent by Carolina Financial pursuant to Section 3.2(a) that
remains unclaimed by the holder of shares of First South Common Stock for 12
months after the Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment
thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Carolina Financial. Any
holder of shares of First South Common Stock who has not theretofore complied
with Section 3.2(c) shall thereafter look only to Carolina Financial for the
consideration deliverable in respect of each share of First South Common Stock
such holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement without any
interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of First South Common
Stock or First South Book-Entry Shares are not surrendered or the payment for
them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of
Carolina Financial Common Stock and cash would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority, the unclaimed items shall, to the
extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become
the property of Carolina Financial (and to the extent not in its possession
shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor
any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of stock
represented by any Certificate or First South Book-Entry Shares for any
consideration paid to a Governmental Authority pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Carolina Financial
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer
books of First South to establish the identity of those persons entitled to
receive the consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be
conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to
ownership of stock represented by any Certificate or Certificates or First
South Book-Entry Shares, Carolina Financial and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deposit any consideration represented thereby in escrow with an
independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims
thereto.

(f)  Adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of First
South shall constitute ratification of the appointment of the Exchange Agent.

   | 3.3| _Effect on Carolina Financial Common Stock._ 
---|---|--- 
  

At and after the Effective Time, each share of Carolina Financial Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of Carolina Financial
and shall not be affected by the Merger.

  



   | 3.4| _First South Options and Equity-Based Awards._ 
---|---|--- 
  

(a)  Prior to the Effective Time, First South shall offer to
enter into a Stock Option Cash-Out Agreement in the form of _Exhibit G_ with
each holder of First South Options having an exercise price per share less
than the per share value of the Merger Consideration to cash out their First
South Options.

  

(b)  As of the Effective Time, Carolina Financial shall have
the right to (i) either assume any options or other stock-based awards ("
_First South Options_ ") substantially in accordance with the terms of the
First South Equity Plans and the option grants or other award agreements by
which they are evidenced in accordance with the terms of the First South
Equity Plans or (ii) replace the First South Options with substantially
identical awards under any plans sponsored by Carolina Financial under which
options and other stock-based awards are granted, and the award agreements
thereunder (each, a " _Carolina Financial Stock Plan_ "), such that after the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any First South
Options, the First South Options shall be converted into and become rights
with respect to Carolina Financial Common Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, (A) each First South Option assumed or replaced by Carolina Financial
may be exercised solely for shares of Carolina Financial Common Stock, (B)
the number of shares of Carolina Financial Common Stock subject to such First
South Option shall be equal to the number of shares of First South Common
Stock subject to such First South Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole
share), and (C) the per share exercise price under each such First South
Option shall be adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent). It is intended that the foregoing assumption shall be
undertaken in a manner that will not constitute a "modification" as defined
in Section 424 of the Code, as to any stock option which is an "incentive
stock option." Carolina Financial and First South agree to take all steps
necessary to effect the provisions of this _Section 3.4(b)_.

  

(c)  First South's Board of Directors and its compensation
committee shall not make any grants of First South Options following the
execution of this Agreement.

(d)  To the extent permitted under applicable Law and the terms
of the First South Bancorp, Inc. 1997 Stock Option Plan, as amended, and the
First South Bancorp, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the "
_First South Equity Plans_ "), First South's Board of Directors or its
compensation committee shall make any adjustments and amendments to or make
such determinations with respect to the First South Options necessary to
effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.4.

   | 3.5| _Rights of Former First South Shareholders._ 
---|---|--- 
  

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of First South shall be
closed as to holders of First South Common Stock and no transfer of First
South Common Stock by any holder of such shares shall thereafter be made or
recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions
of Section 3.2, each Certificate or First South Book-Entry Shares theretofore
representing shares of First South Common Stock (other than Certificates or
First South Book-Entry Shares representing Extinguished Shares), shall from
and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in Article 3.

  



   | 3.6| _Fractional Shares._ 
---|---|--- 
  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of First South Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger, who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Carolina
Financial Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates or First
South Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder), shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part
of a share of Carolina Financial Common Stock multiplied by the Carolina
Financial Average Closing Price. No such holder will be entitled to
dividends, voting rights, or any other rights as a shareholder in respect of
any fractional shares _._

   | 4.6| _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities._ 
---|---|--- 
  

No First South Entity has any Liabilities required under GAAP to be set forth
on a consolidated balance sheet or in the notes thereto that are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a First South

respect to, or obligated to guarantee or assume any Liability of any Person

   | 4.8| _Tax Matters._ 
---|---|--- 
  

(a)  Each of the First South Entities has timely filed with the
appropriate Taxing Authorities, all material Tax Returns in all jurisdictions
in which Tax Returns are required to be filed, and such Tax Returns are
correct and complete in all material respects. None of the First South
Entities is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any
Tax Return. All material Taxes of the First South Entities to the extent due
and payable (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been fully and
timely paid. There are no Liens for any material Taxes (other than a Lien for
current real property or _ad valorem_ Taxes not yet due and payable, or for
Taxes being contested in good faith for which adequate reserves are
established in the First South Financial Statements) filed of record on any
of the Assets of any of the First South Entities. No written claim has ever
been made by any Taxing Authority in a jurisdiction where any First South
Entity does not file a Tax Return that such First South Entity may be subject
to Taxes by that jurisdiction.

  

   

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)  None of the First South Entities has received any written
notice of assessment or proposed assessment in connection with any Taxes.
There are no ongoing or pending claims, audits, or examinations regarding any
Taxes of any First South Entity or the assets of any First South Entity. No
officer or employee responsible for Tax matters of any First South Entity
expects any Taxing Authority to assess any additional material Taxes for any
period for which Tax Returns have been filed. No issue has been raised by a
Taxing Authority in any prior examination of the First South which, by
application of the same or similar principles, could be expected to result in
a proposed material deficiency for any subsequent taxable period. None of the
First South Entities has waived any statute of limitations in respect of any
Taxes that remain in effect or agreed to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

  

(c)  Each First South Entity has complied in all material
respects with all applicable Laws relating to the withholding of Taxes and
the payment thereof to Governmental Authorities, including Taxes required to
have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee or independent contractor, and Taxes required to be withheld and paid
pursuant to Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code or similar provisions under
foreign Law.

  

(d)  The unpaid Taxes of each First South Entity (i) did not,
as of the most recent fiscal month end, materially exceed the reserve for Tax
Liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
most recent balance sheet (rather than in any notes thereto) for such First
South Entity and (ii) do not materially exceed that reserve as adjusted for
the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with past
custom and practice of the First South Entities in filing their Tax Returns.

  

(e)  Except as disclosed in Section 4.8(e) of the First South
Disclosure Memorandum, none of the First South Entities is a party to any Tax
allocation or sharing agreement and none of the First South Entities has been
a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax
Return (other than a group the common parent of which was First South) or has
any Liability for Taxes of any Person (other than First South or any of its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, or as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise.

  

(f)  During the five-year period ending on the date hereof,
none of the First South Entities was a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" as defined in, and in a transaction intended to be
governed by Section 355 of the Code.

  

(g)  None of the First South Entities has made any payments, is
obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any contract that could
obligate it to make any payments, for which a deduction could be disallowed
under Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code, or that would be subject to
withholding under Section 4999 of the Code. None of the First South Entities
has been or will be required to include any adjustment in taxable income for
any Tax period (or portion thereof) pursuant to Section 481 of the Code or
any comparable provision under state or foreign Tax Laws as a result of
transactions or events occurring prior to the Closing. There is no material
taxable income of First South that will be required under applicable tax law
to be reported by Carolina Financial for a taxable period beginning after the
date of the Effective Time which taxable income was realized prior to the
Closing Date. Any net operating losses of the First South Entities disclosed
in Section 4.8(g) of the First South Disclosure Memorandum are not subject to
any limitation on their use under the provisions of Sections 382 or 269 of the
Code or any other provisions of the Code or the Treasury Regulations dealing
with the utilization of net operating losses other than any such limitations
as may arise as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

   

 | 13| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(h)  Each of the First South Entities is in compliance in all
material respects with, and its records contain all information and documents
(including properly completed IRS Forms W-9) necessary to comply in all
material respects with, all applicable information reporting and Tax
withholding requirements under federal, state, and local Tax Laws, and such
records identify with specificity all accounts subject to backup withholding

Act of 1986, (ii) "tax-exempt use property" within the meaning of Section
168(h)(1) of the Code, (iii) "tax-exempt bond financed property" within the
meaning of Section 168(g) of the Code, (iv) "limited use property" within the
meaning of IRS Revenue Procedure 76-30, (v) tangible property used
predominantly outside the United States, or (vi) subject to any provision of
state, local or foreign Law comparable to any of the provisions listed above
in this paragraph.

  

(k)  No First South Entity has any "corporate acquisition
indebtedness" within the meaning of Section 279 of the Code.

  

(l)  First South has disclosed on its federal income Tax
Returns all positions taken therein that are reasonably believed to give rise
to substantial understatement of federal income tax within the meaning of
Section 6662 of the Code.

For purposes of this Section 4.8, any reference to First South or any First
South Entity shall be deemed to include any Person that merged with or was

   | 4.9| _Allowance for Possible Loan Losses; Loan and Investment
Portfolios, etc._ 
---|---|--- 
  

(a)  First South's allowance for possible loan or lease losses
(the " _Allowance_ ") is, and has been since January 1, 2016, in material
compliance with First South's methodology for determining the adequacy of its
allowance for loan losses as well as the standards established by applicable
Governmental Authorities and the Financial Accounting Standards Board in all
material respects.

  

(b)  As of the date hereof, all loans, discounts and leases (in
which any First South Entity is lessor) reflected on First South's Financial
Statements were, and with respect to the consolidated balance sheets delivered
as of the dates subsequent to the execution of this Agreement will be as of
the dates thereof, (a) at the time and under the circumstances in which made,
made for good, valuable and adequate consideration in the ordinary course of
business and, to the Knowledge of First South, are the legal and binding
obligations of the obligors thereof, (b) evidenced by genuine notes,
agreements, or other evidences of indebtedness and (c) to the extent
secured, to the Knowledge of First South, have been secured by valid liens
and security interests which have been perfected. Accurate lists of all
loans, discounts, other real estate owned and financing leases as of June 9,
2017 and on a monthly basis thereafter, and of the investment portfolios of
each First South Entity as of such date, have been and will be made available
to Carolina Financial concurrently with the First South Disclosure
Memorandum. Except as specifically set forth in Section 4.9(b) of the First
South Disclosure Memorandum, neither First South nor First South Bank is a
party to any written or oral loan agreement, note, or borrowing arrangement,
including any loan guaranty, that was, as of the most recent month-end (i)
delinquent by more than 30 days in the payment of principal or interest, (ii)
otherwise in material default for more than 30 days, (iii) classified as
"substandard," "doubtful," "loss," "other assets especially mentioned" or any
comparable classification by First South or under the standards of any

corporation or enterprise controlling, controlled by or under common control
with any of the foregoing, or (v) in material violation of any Law.

  

(c)  All securities held by First South or First South Bank, as
reflected in the consolidated balance sheets of First South included in the
First South Financial Statements, are carried in accordance with GAAP,
specifically including Accounting Standards Codification Topic 320,
Investments - Debt and Equity Securities. Except for pledges to secure public
and trust deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, to the Knowledge of
First South, none of the securities reflected in the First South Financial
Statements as of March 31, 2017, and none of the securities since acquired by
First South or First South Bank is subject to any restriction, whether
contractual or statutory, which impairs the ability of First South or First
South Bank to freely dispose of such security at any time, other than those
restrictions imposed on securities held to maturity under GAAP, pursuant to a
clearing agreement or in accordance with laws.

  

(d)  Section 4.9(d) of the First South Disclosure Memorandum
lists all interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements, futures and
forward contracts and other similar risk management arrangements, whether
entered into for First South's own account, or for the account of First South
Bank or its customers, and all such risk management agreements or arrangements
were entered into (a) in the ordinary and usual course of business consistent
with past practice and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and regulatory policies, and (b) with counterparties believed to
be financially responsible at the time; and each of them constitutes the
valid and legally binding obligation of First South or First South Bank,
enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights or by general equity principles), and is in full
force and effect. Neither First South nor First South Bank, nor to the First
South's Knowledge, any other party thereto, is in breach of any material
obligation under any such agreement or arrangement.

   | 4.10| _Assets._ 
---|---|--- 
  

(a)  Except as disclosed or reserved against in the First South
Financial Statements, the First South Entities have good and marketable
title, free and clear of all Liens except those permitted in Section 4.10(e),
to all of their respective Assets that they own. In addition, to First
South's Knowledge, all tangible properties used in the businesses of the First
South Entities are in good condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and
are usable in the ordinary course of business consistent with First South's
past practices.

  

(b)  All Assets which are material to First South's business,
held under leases or subleases by any of the First South Entities, are held
under valid Contracts enforceable in accordance with their respective terms
(except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive
relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
may be brought), and to the Knowledge of First South each such Contract is in
full force and effect.

  

(c)  The First South Entities currently maintain insurance,
including bankers' blanket bonds, with insurers of recognized financial
responsibility in such amounts as management of First South has reasonably
determined to be prudent. None of the First South Entities has received
notice from any insurance carrier that (i) any policy of insurance will be
canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, (ii)
premium costs with respect to such policies of insurance will be
substantially increased, or (iii) similar coverage will be denied or limited
or not extended or renewed with respect to any First South Entity, any act or
occurrence, or that any Asset, officer, director, employee or agent of any
First South Entity will not be covered by such insurance or bond. There are
presently no claims for amounts exceeding $50,000 individually or in the
aggregate pending under such policies of insurance or bonds, and no written
notices of claims in excess of such amounts have been given by any First
South Entity under such policies. First South has made no claims, and no
claims are contemplated to be made, under its directors' and officers' errors
and omissions or other insurance or bankers' blanket bond.

  

(d)  The Assets of the First South Entities include all
material Assets required by First South Entities to operate the business of
the First South Entities as presently conducted. All real and personal
property which is material to the business of First South or First South Bank
that is leased or licensed by it is held pursuant to leases or licenses which
are valid and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms (except
in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is
subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be
brought) and, to the Knowledge of First South, such leases and licenses will
not terminate or lapse prior to the Effective Time or thereafter by reason of
completion of the Merger. To the Knowledge of First South, all improved real
property owned or leased by First South or First South Bank is in material
compliance with all applicable laws, including zoning laws and the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990.

  

(e)  Each First South Entity has fee simple title to all the
real property assets reflected in the First South Financial Statements as
being owned by a First South Entity or acquired after the date thereof (except
properties sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the
ordinary course of business) (the " _First South Realty_ "), free and clear of
all Liens of any nature whatsoever, except (i) statutory Liens securing
payments not yet due, (ii) Liens for real property or ad valorem Taxes not
yet delinquent (or being contested in good faith and for which adequate
reserves have been established), (iii) easements, rights of way and other
similar encumbrances and matters of record that do not materially adversely
affect the use of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected
thereby as used by a First South Entity on the date hereof or otherwise
materially impair business operations at such properties, as conducted by a
First South Entity on the date hereof and (iv) such imperfections
or irregularities of title or Liens as do not materially affect the use of
the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise
materially impair business operations at such properties as used on the date
hereof.

---|---|--- 

 



    

(f)  To the Knowledge of First South, the First South Realty
and the real property with respect to which a First South Entity is the
lessee (the " _First South Leased Real Properties_ ") are in material
compliance with all applicable building, fire, zoning (or are legal
nonconforming uses allowed under applicable zoning ordinances) and other
applicable laws, ordinances and regulations and with all deed restrictions of
record, no written notice of any material violation or material alleged
violation thereof has been received in the past three years that has not been
resolved, and there are no proposed changes therein that would materially and
adversely affect the First South Realty, the First South Leased Real
Properties or their uses. First South has no Knowledge of any proposed or
pending change in the zoning of, or of any proposed or pending condemnation
proceeding with respect to, any of the First South Realty or the First South
Leased Real Properties which may materially and adversely affect the
First South Realty or the First South Leased Real Properties or the current
use by a First South Entity thereof.

   | 4.11| _Intellectual Property._ 
---|---|--- 
  

Each First South Entity owns or has a license to use all of the Intellectual
Property used by such First South Entity in the course of its business,
including sufficient rights in each copy possessed by each First South
Entity. Each First South Entity is the owner of or has a license, with the
right to sublicense, to any Intellectual Property sold or licensed to a third
party by such First South Entity in connection with such First South Entity's
business operations, and such First South Entity has the right to convey by
sale or license any Intellectual Property so conveyed. To the Knowledge of
First South, no First South Entity is in material Default under any of its
Intellectual Property licenses. No proceedings have been instituted, or are
pending or to First South's Knowledge threatened, which challenge the rights
of any First South Entity with respect to Intellectual Property used, sold, or
licensed by such First South Entity in the course of its business, nor has
any person claimed or alleged that any First South Entity has misappropriated
any rights to such Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of First South, the
conduct of the business of the First South Entities does not infringe any
Intellectual Property of any other person. No First South Entity is obligated
to pay any recurring royalties to any Person with respect to any such
Intellectual Property, other than any license or maintenance fees specified
in a license agreement with such party. First South does not have any
Contracts with its directors, officers, or employees which require such
officer, director, or employee to assign any interest in any Intellectual
Property to a First South Entity and to keep confidential any trade secrets,
proprietary data, customer information, or other business information of a
First South Entity, and to First South's Knowledge, no such officer,
director, or employee is party to any Contract with any Person other than a
First South Entity which requires such officer, director or employee to
assign any interest in any Intellectual Property to any Person other than a
First South Entity or to keep confidential any trade secrets, proprietary
data, customer information, or other business information of any Person other
than a First South Entity. To First South's Knowledge, no officer, director,
or employee of any First South Entity is party to any confidentiality,
nonsolicitation, noncompetition, or other Contract which restricts
or prohibits such officer, director, or employee from engaging in activities
competitive with any Person, including any First South Entity.

activities of any nature seeking to impose, or that are reasonably likely to
result in, any material liability or obligation of the First South Entities
arising under any Environmental Law pending or, to First South's Knowledge,
threatened against the First South Entities. To First South's Knowledge,
there is no reasonable basis for, or circumstances that are reasonably likely
to give rise to, any such proceeding, claim, action, investigation or
remediation by any Governmental Authority or any third party that would give
rise to any material liability or obligation on the part of the First South
Entities. None of the First South Entities is subject to any
agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any
Governmental Authority or third party imposing any liability or
obligation with respect to any of the foregoing. Each property owned or
operated by First South, and, to First South's Knowledge, any property in
which any of the First South Entities holds a security interest, is in
material compliance with all Environmental Laws.

   | 4.15| _Employee Benefit Plans._ 
---|---|--- 
  

(a)  First South has disclosed in Section 4.15(a) of the First
South Disclosure Memorandum, and has delivered or made available to Carolina

Employee Benefit Plan currently adopted, maintained by, sponsored in whole or
in part by, or contributed or required to be contributed to by any First South
Entity or any ERISA Affiliate thereof for the benefit of employees, former
employees, retirees, directors, independent contractors, or their respective
dependents, spouses, or other beneficiaries or under which employees,
retirees, former employees, directors, independent contractors, or
their respective dependents, spouses, or other beneficiaries are eligible to
participate (each, a " _First South Benefit Plan_ ," and collectively, the "
_First South Benefit Plans_ ") and (ii) a list of each Employee Benefit Plan
that is not identified in (i) above and in connection with which any First
South Entity or any ERISA Affiliate thereof has or reasonably could have any

(c)  Each First South Benefit Plan is in material compliance
with the terms of such First South Benefit Plan, in material compliance with
the applicable requirements of the Code, in material compliance with the
applicable requirements of ERISA, and in material compliance with any and all
other applicable Laws. Each First South ERISA Plan which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter or opinion from the IRS or, in the alternative,
appropriately relies upon a favorable opinion letter or advisory letter
issued to a prototype plan or volume submitter under which the First South
ERISA Plan has been adopted and First South is not aware of any circumstances
likely to result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter.
First South has not received any communication (written or unwritten) from any
Governmental Authority questioning or challenging the compliance of any First
South Benefit Plan with applicable Laws. No First South Benefit Plan
is currently being audited by any Governmental Authority for compliance with
applicable Laws or has been audited with a determination by any Governmental
Authority that the First South Benefit Plan failed to comply with applicable
Laws.

  

(d)  There has been no material written or, to the First
South's Knowledge, oral representation or communication with respect to any
aspect of the First South Benefit Plans made to employees of the First South
which is not in all material respects in accordance with the written or
otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of such plans. Neither First South
nor, to the Knowledge of First South, any administrator or fiduciary of any
First South Benefit Plan (or any agent of any of the foregoing) has engaged in
any transaction, or acted or failed to act in any manner, which could subject
First South or Carolina Financial to any direct or indirect Liability (by
indemnity or otherwise) for breach of any fiduciary, co-fiduciary, or other
duty under ERISA. There are no unresolved claims or disputes under the terms
of, or in connection with, the First South Benefit Plans other than claims for
benefits which are payable in the ordinary course of business and no action,
proceeding, prosecution, inquiry, hearing, or investigation has
been commenced with respect to any First South Benefit Plan other than
routine claims for benefits.

  

(e)  All First South Benefit Plan documents and annual reports
or returns, audited or unaudited financial statements, actuarial valuations,
summary annual reports, and summary plan descriptions issued with respect to
the First South Benefit Plans are correct and complete in all material
respects, and to the extent applicable, have been timely filed with the IRS or
the DOL, and distributed to participants of the First South Benefit Plans (to
the extent required by Law), and there have been no material misstatements or
omissions in the information set forth therein.

  

(f)  To the First South's Knowledge, no "Party in Interest"
(as defined in ERISA Section 3(14)) or "Disqualified Person" (as defined in
Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of any First South Benefit Plan has engaged in any
nonexempt "Prohibited Transaction" (described in Code Section 4975(c) or
ERISA Section 406).

  

(g)  No First South Entity nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has,
or ever has had, any obligation or Liability in connection with, any plan
that is or was subject to Code Section 412 or ERISA Section 302 or Title IV of
ERISA.

  

(h)  No material Liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or
is expected to be incurred by any First South Entity or any ERISA Affiliate
thereof, and no event has occurred that could reasonably result in Liability
under Title IV of ERISA being incurred by any First South Entity or any ERISA
Affiliate thereof with respect to any ongoing, frozen, terminated, or other
single-employer plan of any First South Entity or the single-employer plan of
any ERISA Affiliate. Except as may arise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, there has been no "reportable
event," within the meaning of ERISA Section 4043, for which the 30-day
reporting requirement has not been waived by any ongoing, frozen, terminated,
or other single-employer plan of First South or of an ERISA Affiliate.

  

   

 | 21| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(i)  Except as required under Part 6 of ERISA or Code Section
4980B, no First South Entity has any material Liability or obligation for
retiree or post-termination of employment or services health or life benefits
under any of the First South Benefit Plans, or other plan or arrangement, and
there are no restrictions on the rights of such First South Entity to amend or
terminate any and all such retiree or post-termination of employment or
services health or benefit plans or arrangements without incurring any
Liability. No Tax under Code Sections 4980B or 5000 has been incurred with
respect to any First South Benefit Plan, or other plan or arrangement, and no
circumstance exists which could give rise to such Taxes.

  

(j)  Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(j) of the First South
Disclosure Memorandum, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result
in any payment for or related to individual services (including severance,
unemployment compensation, "excess parachute payment" as defined under Code
Section 280G, or otherwise) becoming due from any First South Entity to any
employee, officer, director or independent contractor under any First South
Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any First South Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any such benefit, or any benefit under any life
insurance owned by any First South Entity or the rights of any First South
Entity in, to or under any insurance on the life of any current or former
officer, director, or employee of any First South Entity, or change any rights
or obligations of any First South Entity with respect to such insurance.

  

(k)  Section 4.15(k) of the First South Disclosure Memorandum
sets forth preliminary calculations, based on assumptions set forth therein,
of the following: (i) the amount of all payments and benefits to which each
individual set forth on such First South Disclosure Memorandum is entitled to
receive, pursuant to all employment, salary continuation, bonus, change in
control, and all other agreements, plans and arrangements, in connection with
a termination of employment before or following, or otherwise in connection
with or contingent upon, the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
(for the avoidance of doubt, excluding payments or benefits in respect of
vested equity awards) (each such total amount in respect of each such

South or any of its ERISA Affiliates is obligated to contribute or otherwise
has any liability or contingent liability) satisfies the requirements of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the regulations and guidance
issued thereunder (" _PPACA_ "), such that there is no Tax or penalty that

resolutions of its Board of Directors in support of, any of the actions
prohibited by this Section 6.2;

  

(v)  maintain First South Bank's allowance for loan losses in a
manner inconsistent with GAAP and applicable regulatory guidelines and
accounting principles, practices and methods consistent with past practices of
First South Bank; or

  

(w)  take any action or fail to take any action that at the time
of such action or inaction is reasonably likely to prevent, or would be
reasonably likely to materially interfere with, the consummation of the
Merger.

   | 6.3| _Adverse Changes in Condition._ 
---|---|--- 
  

Each Party agrees to give written notice promptly to the other Party upon
becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or
circumstance relating to it or any of its Subsidiaries which (i) has had or
is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a First South
Material Adverse Effect or a Carolina Financial Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable, (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, or covenants contained herein, or (iii) would be
reasonably likely to prevent or materially interfere with the consummation of
the Merger, and to use its reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly to
remedy the same.

  



   | 6.4| _Reports._

Each of Carolina Financial and its Subsidiaries and First South and the First
South Entities shall file all reports required to be filed by it with

Time and shall make available to the other Party copies of all such reports
promptly after the same are filed. First South and the First South Entities
shall also make available to Carolina Financial monthly financial statements,
copies of all written materials provided to members of First South's board of
Directors in connection with its regular monthly meetings (other than reports
or presentations prepared by the First South Financial Advisor or legal
counsel in connection with the Merger or materials containing confidential
supervisory information) and quarterly call reports following distribution to
First South's Board of Directors or filing, as applicable. The financial
statements of Carolina Financial and First South, whether or not contained in
any such reports filed under the Exchange Act or with any other Regulatory
Authority, will fairly present the consolidated financial position of the
entity filing such statements as of the dates indicated and the consolidated
results of operations, changes in shareholders' or stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for the periods then ended in accordance with GAAP (subject in the
case of interim financial statements to normal recurring year-end adjustments
that are not material). As of their respective dates, such reports of Carolina
Financial and First South filed under the Exchange Act or with any other
Regulatory Authority will comply in all material respects with the Securities
Laws and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Any financial statements contained in any other
reports to another Regulatory Authority shall be prepared in accordance with
the Laws applicable to such reports.

---|---|--- 
  

Carolina Financial acknowledges that IIPI disclosed to Carolina Financial
Entities in connection with the Agreement has been and will be disclosed

disclose IIPI, nor permit the use or disclosure of IIPI, other than for the
purposes described in 15 U.S.C. § 6802(e)(7).

  



  

Article 7 

  

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

   | 7.1| _Shareholder Approvals._ 
---|---|--- 
  

(a)  Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with its terms, First South shall submit to its shareholders this Agreement
and any other matters required to be approved by shareholders in order to
carry out the intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of that
obligation, First South shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and its
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, all action necessary to call, give
notice of, convene, and hold First South's Shareholders' Meeting as soon as
reasonably practicable. The First South Board shall recommend that its
shareholders approve this Agreement in accordance with the VSCA (the " _First
South Recommendation_ ") and shall include such recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, except to the extent the First South's Board has
made an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined below) in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. Subject to Section 7.1(b) and 7.3, First
South shall solicit and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Requisite First South Shareholder Vote.

  

(b)  Neither First South's Board nor any committee thereof
shall, except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.1(b), (i) withdraw,
qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to Carolina Financial, the First South Recommendation or (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal (each, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Requisite First South Shareholder
Vote, the First South's Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if and
only if (A) a material development or material change in circumstance occurs,
arises or becomes known to First South's Board after the date of this
Agreement unrelated to any potential or actual Acquisition Proposal (such
material development or change in circumstances being referred to as an "
_Intervening Event_ ") and First South's Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with First South's outside counsel, that in light of such
Intervening Event an Adverse Recommendation Change is required in order for
First South's Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to First South's
shareholders under applicable Law, or (B):

  

(i)  First South's Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the First South Financial Advisor and outside counsel, that
it has received an Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of
Section 7.3) that is a Superior Proposal;

  

(ii)  First South's Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with First South's outside counsel, that a failure to accept
such Superior Proposal would result in First South's Board breaching its
fiduciary duties to First South and its shareholders under applicable Law;

  

(iii)  First South's Board provides written notice (a " _Notice of
Recommendation Change_ ") to Carolina Financial of its receipt of the
Superior Proposal and its intent to announce an Adverse Recommendation Change
on the fifth business day following delivery of such notice, which notice
shall specify the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (and
include a copy thereof with all accompanying documentation, if in writing)
and identify the Person or Group making such Superior Proposal (it being
understood that any amendment to any material term of such Acquisition
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Recommendation Change, except that, in
such case, the five business day period referred to in this clause (iii) and
in clauses (iv) and (v) shall be reduced to three business days following the
giving of such new Notice of Recommendation Change);

  

   

 | 40| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(iv)  after providing such Notice of Recommendation Change, First
South shall negotiate in good faith with Carolina Financial (if requested by
Carolina Financial) and provide Carolina Financial reasonable opportunity
during the subsequent five business day period to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the First South
Board to proceed without an Adverse Recommendation Change ( _provided,
however,_ that Carolina Financial shall not be required to propose any such
adjustments); and

  

(v)  First South's Board, following such five business day
period, again determines in good faith, after consultation with the First
South Financial Advisor and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that failure to
take such action would violate their fiduciary duties to First South and its
shareholders under applicable Law.

  

(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
except to the extent prohibited by the VSCA as determined by First South
after consultation with First South's outside counsel, First South shall
submit this Agreement to its shareholders at the First South's Shareholders'
Meeting even if First South's Board has made an Adverse Recommendation
Change, in which case the First South's Board may communicate the Adverse
Recommendation Change and the basis for it to the shareholders of First South
in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto; _provided, however,_  that First South may postpone or
adjourn First South's Shareholders' Meeting: (i) with the consent of Carolina
Financial; (ii) for the absence of a quorum; (iii) to the extent necessary to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to the shareholders of First South within a
reasonable period of time in advance of First South's Shareholders' Meeting;
(iv) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies; (v) if
required by applicable Law; or (vi) if First South has provided a Notice of
Recommendation Change to Carolina Financial pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii)
and the notice period contemplated by Section 7.1(b)(iii) has not yet expired.

  

(d)  Carolina Financial shall submit to its stockholders this
Agreement and any other matters required to be approved by its stockholders
in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement, including the issuance
of the Merger Consideration. In furtherance of that obligation, Carolina
Financial shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and its Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws, all action necessary to call, give notice of,
convene, and hold Carolina Financial's Stockholders' Meeting as soon as
reasonably practicable. The Carolina Financial Board shall recommend that its
stockholders approve this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL and approve
the issuance of the Merger Consideration in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market and shall include such recommendations
in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Carolina Financial shall solicit and
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Carolina Financial
Stockholder Votes.

   | 7.2| _Securities Act Compliance._ 
---|---|--- 
  

(a)  As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, Carolina Financial shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Registration Statement, which shall include the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and constitute the prospectus relating to the shares of
Carolina Financial Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. First South will
furnish to Carolina Financial the information required to be included in the
Registration Statement with respect to its business and affairs and shall have
the right to review and consult with Carolina Financial on the form of, and
any characterizations of such information included in, the
Registration Statement prior to its being filed with the SEC. Carolina
Financial shall use reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Carolina Financial and First
South will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to their respective shareholders or
stockholders, as applicable, as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act.
Carolina Financial will advise First South, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Carolina Financial Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Registration Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to Carolina Financial or First South, or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Carolina
Financial or First South which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any of the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent
required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed by Carolina Financial with
the SEC and disseminated by First South to its shareholders and by Carolina
Financial to its stockholders.

  

   

 | 41| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)  Carolina Financial shall also take any action required to
be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the
Merger and each of Carolina Financial and First South shall furnish all
information concerning it and the holders of First South Common Stock as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

  

(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, Carolina Financial shall
notify the NASDAQ Stock Market of the additional shares of Carolina Financial
Common Stock to be issued by Carolina Financial in exchange for the shares of
First South Common Stock.

   | 7.3| _Other Offers, etc._ 
---|---|--- 
  

(a)  From the date of this Agreement through the first to occur
of the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement, each First South
Entity shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly (i) solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage,
induce or knowingly facilitate the making, submission, or announcement of any
proposal that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any
discussions (except to notify a third party of the existence of restrictions
provided in this Section 7.3 or to clarify the terms and conditions of an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal) or negotiations regarding, or disclose or
provide any nonpublic information with respect to, or knowingly take any other
action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement (including
any agreement in principle, letter of intent or understanding, merger
agreement, stock purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, or share
exchange agreement, but excluding a confidentiality agreement of the type
described below) (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") contemplating or otherwise
relating to any Acquisition Transaction, or (iv) propose or agree to do any of
the foregoing; _provided, however,_ that prior to the Requisite First South
Shareholder Vote, this Section 7.3 shall not prohibit a First South
Entity from furnishing nonpublic information regarding any First South Entity
to, or entering into a confidentiality agreement or discussions or
negotiations with, any Person or Group in response to a _bona fide_ ,
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Person or Group
(and not withdrawn) if and only if: (A) no First South Entity or
Representative or Affiliate thereof shall have violated any of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 7.3 (other than any breach of such
obligation that is unintentional and immaterial and did not result in the
submission of such Acquisition Proposal), (B) First South's Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with the First South Financial
Advisor and First South's outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
(C) First South's Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to First South and its
shareholders, (D) (1) at least two business days prior to furnishing any such
nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
such Person or Group, First South gives Carolina Financial written notice
(which may be by electronic mail) of the identity of such Person or Group and
of First South's intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into
discussions or negotiations with, such Person or Group, and (2) First
South receives from such Person or Group an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms no less favorable to the disclosing Party than the
confidentiality terms of this Agreement, and (E) contemporaneously with
furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person or Group, First
South furnishes such nonpublic information to Carolina Financial (to the
extent such nonpublic information has not been previously furnished by First
South to Carolina Financial). In addition to the foregoing, First South shall
provide Carolina Financial with at least two business days' prior written
notice of a meeting of First South's Board at which meeting First South's
Board is reasonably expected to resolve to recommend the Acquisition Agreement
as a Superior Proposal to its shareholders, and First South shall keep
Carolina Financial reasonably informed on a prompt basis, of the status and
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, including any material
amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material
terms thereof.

  

   

 | 42| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)  In addition to the obligations of First South set forth in
this Section 7.3, as promptly as practicable, after any of the directors or
executive officers of First South become aware thereof, First South shall
advise Carolina Financial of any request received by First South for
nonpublic information which First South reasonably believes could lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such request or Acquisition Proposal, and the identity of
the Person or Group making any such request or Acquisition Proposal. First
South shall keep Carolina Financial informed promptly of material amendments
or modifications to any such request or Acquisition Proposal.

  

(c)  First South shall, and shall cause its and each First
South Entity's directors, officers, employees, and Representatives to
immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions, or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and will use and cause to be used all commercially
reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar or related
agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

  

(d)  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a Party
or its Board of Directors from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, _provided, however,_
that such Rule will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action
pursuant to such Rule would otherwise have under this Agreement; (ii) making
any disclosure to First South's shareholders if First South's Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with applicable Law, (iii) informing any Person of the existence
of the provisions contained in this Section 7.3 or (iv) making any "stop, look
and listen" communication to First South's shareholders pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to First
South's shareholders).

   | 7.4| _Consents of Regulatory Authorities._ 
---|---|--- 
  

The Parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation and applications, to effect all applications, notices,
petitions and filings, and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
Consents of all Regulatory Authorities and other Persons which are necessary
or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger). The Parties agree that they will consult with each
other with respect to the obtaining of all Consents of all Regulatory
Authorities and other Persons necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein. Each Party also shall promptly advise the
other upon receiving any communication from any Regulatory Authority or other
Person whose Consent is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement which causes such Party to believe that there
is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite Consent will not be obtained or
that the receipt of any such Consent will be materially delayed.

  



  

   

 | 43| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 7.5| _Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate._ 
---|---|--- 
  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to
use, and to cause its Subsidiaries to use, its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using its commercially reasonable efforts to lift or rescind any
Order adversely affecting its ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein and to cause to be satisfied the conditions referred to
in Article 8; _provided,_ _however,_ that nothing herein shall
preclude either Party from exercising its rights under this Agreement.

  



   | 7.6| _Investigation and Confidentiality._ 
---|---|--- 
  

(a)  Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall keep the
other Party advised of all material developments relevant to its business and
the consummation of the Merger and shall permit the other Party to make or
cause to be made such investigation of its business and properties (including
that of its Subsidiaries) and of their respective financial and legal
conditions as the other Party reasonably requests, _provided, that_ such
investigation shall be reasonably related to the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not interfere unnecessarily or materially with
normal operations. No investigation by a Party shall affect the ability of
such Party to rely on the representations and warranties of the other Party.
Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, First South shall permit
Carolina Financial's senior officers and independent accountants to meet with
the senior officers of First South, including officers responsible for the
First South Financial Statements, the internal controls of First South, and
the disclosure controls and procedures of First South and First South's
independent public accountants, to discuss such matters as Carolina Financial
may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate for Carolina Financial to satisfy
its obligations under Sections 302, 404 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  

(b)  In addition to each Party's obligations pursuant to
Section 7.6(a), each Party shall, and shall cause its advisors and agents to,
maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it
by the other Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries' businesses,
operations, and financial positions and shall not use such information for any
purpose except in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each
Party shall promptly return or certify the destruction of all documents and
copies thereof, and all work papers containing confidential information
received from the other Party.

  

(c)  First South shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to exercise, and shall not waive any of, its rights under
confidentiality agreements entered into with Persons which were considering
an Acquisition Proposal with respect to First South to preserve
the confidentiality of the information relating to the First South Entities
provided to such Persons and their Affiliates and Representatives.

  

   

 | 44| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(d)  Each Party agrees to give the other Party notice as soon
as practicable after any determination by it of any fact or
occurrence relating to the other Party which it has discovered through the
course of its investigation and which represents, or is reasonably likely to
represent, either a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
or agreement of the other Party or which has had or is reasonably likely to
have a First South Material Adverse Effect or a Carolina Financial Material
Adverse Effect, as applicable.

  

(e)  Each Carolina Financial Entity shall, in accordance with
Carolina Financial's comprehensive written data security program established
and maintained pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 6801 and regulations promulgated
thereunder (" _Carolina Financial Security Program_ "), safeguard IIPI
disclosed to that Carolina Financial Entity pursuant to this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that any
Carolina Financial Entity allows a third party to access such IIPI, Carolina
Financial shall ensure that the third party safeguards that IIPI in accordance
with a data security program substantially equivalent to the Carolina
Financial Security Program.

  

(f)  Carolina Financial shall notify First South promptly (but
in no event more than 24 hours) of any Data Incident. All Carolina Financial
Entities shall promptly take all actions that are necessary and advisable to
correct, mitigate, and prevent recurrence of the Data Incident. All Carolina
Financial Entities shall cooperate fully with First South and its designees in
all reasonable efforts to investigate the Data Incident.

  

(g)  If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective
Time, each Carolina Financial Entity shall promptly return or dispose of, and
certify the return or disposal, of all IIPI received by the Carolina Financial
Entity in connection with this Agreement. Any disposal of such IIPI must be
performed in a manner that ensures that the IIPI is rendered permanently
unreadable and unrecoverable.

   | 7.7| _Press Releases._ 
---|---|--- 
  

Prior to the Effective Time, First South and Carolina Financial shall consult
with each other as to the form and substance of any press release,
communication with First South's shareholders, or other public disclosure
materially related to this Agreement, or any other transaction contemplated
hereby; _provided,_ _however,_ that nothing in this Section 7.7 shall be
deemed to prohibit any Party from making any disclosure which its counsel
deems necessary or advisable in order to satisfy such Party's disclosure
obligations imposed by Law.

  



   | 7.8| _Charter Provisions._ 
---|---|--- 
  

Each First South Entity shall take all necessary action to ensure that the
entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the
grant of any rights to any Person under the Certificate of
Incorporation, Bylaws, or other governing instruments of any First South
Entity or restrict or impair the ability of Carolina Financial or any of its
Subsidiaries to vote, or otherwise to exercise the rights of a shareholder
with respect to, shares of any First South Entity that may be directly or
indirectly acquired or controlled by them.

  



   | 7.9| _Employee Benefits and Contracts._ 
---|---|--- 
  

(a)  Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, all
persons who are employees of the First South Entities immediately prior to
the Effective Time and whose employment is not terminated, if any, at or prior
to the Effective Time (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall, at the Effective
Time, become at-will employees of the Surviving Bank or one of its
subsidiaries; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall any of the
employees of the First South Entities be officers of the Surviving Corporation
or the Surviving Bank, or have or exercise any power or duty conferred upon
such an officer, unless and until duly elected or appointed to such position
by the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Bank
and in accordance with the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or the
Surviving Bank. All of the Continuing Employees shall be employed at the will
of the Surviving Bank, and no contractual right to employment shall inure to
such employees because of this Agreement except as may be otherwise expressly
set forth in this Agreement.

  

   

 | 45| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)  As of the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee shall
be eligible to participate in each of Carolina Financial's Employee Benefit
Plans with full credit for prior service with First South and any other First
South Entity solely for purposes of eligibility and vesting, except that such
service shall also be credited for purposes of calculating benefits under
Carolina Financial's standard severance policy. For the avoidance of doubt,
each Continuing Employee who is terminated involuntarily other than for cause
(as determined by the Carolina Financial) will be eligible to receive
severance benefits under Carolina Financial's standard severance policy for
its employees, an accurate and complete description of which has been provided
to First South, in addition to outplacement assistance; _provided, however,_
that any Continuing Employees who are eligible to receive severance benefits,
change of control benefits or any payments that are enhanced on account of the
Merger pursuant to an individual employment arrangement, change of control
arrangement or deferred compensation plan other than any Retention Bonus
Agreement shall not be eligible to receive severance benefits under Carolina
Financial's standard severance policy.

  

(c)  As of the Effective Time, Carolina Financial shall make
available employer-provided benefits under Carolina Financial
Employee Benefit Plans to each Continuing Employee on the same basis as it
provides such coverage to Carolina Financial or CresCom Bank employees. With
respect to Carolina Financial Employee Benefit Plans providing health
coverage, Carolina Financial shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any pre-existing condition, eligibility waiting period, or other
limitations or exclusions otherwise applicable under such plans to new
employees not to apply to a Continuing Employee or their covered dependents
who were covered under a similar First South plan at the Effective Time of
the Merger. In addition, if any such transition occurs during the middle of a
plan year, Carolina Financial shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any such successor Carolina Financial Employee Benefit Plan providing
health coverage to give credit towards satisfaction of any annual deductible
limitation and out-of-pocket maximum applied under such successor plan for
any deductible, co-payment and other cost-sharing amounts previously paid by a
Continuing Employee respecting his or her participation in the corresponding
First South Employee Benefit Plan during that plan year prior to the
transition effective date.

  

(d)  First South shall cause each of First South's directors
who are not employees of First South or First South Bank to execute and
deliver a Non-Employee Director Non-Competition Agreement dated as of the date
hereof (and which shall be effective as of the Effective Time) in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_

  

(e)  Except as disclosed in Section 7.9 of the First South
Disclosure Memorandum, First South shall cause each of First
South's Executive Officers and directors to execute and deliver a Shareholder
Support Agreement dated as of the date hereof in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit C_ pursuant to which he or she will vote his or her shares of First
South Common Stock in favor of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

(f)  No officer, employee, or other Person (other than the
corporate Parties to this Agreement) shall be deemed a third party or other
beneficiary of this Agreement, and no such Person shall have any right or
other entitlement to enforce any provision of this Agreement or seek any
remedy in connection with this Agreement, except as may be expressly set forth
in Section 7.11. No provision of this Agreement constitutes or shall be
deemed to constitute, an employee benefit plan or other arrangement, an
amendment of any employee benefit plan or other arrangement, or any provision
of any employee benefit plan or other arrangement.

  

   

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(g)  First South shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the employees designated by Carolina Financial to execute a CresCom Merger /
Cash Retention Bonus Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_.

  

(h)  Consistent with applicable Law, First South shall notify
each holder of First South Options having an exercise price per share less
than the per share value of the Merger Consideration of such optionee's right
to enter into a Stock Option Cash-Out Agreement in the form of _Exhibit G_.

  

(i)  Concurrently with or as soon as practicable after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, Bruce W. Elder and Cornelius F.
Sullivan shall enter into employment agreements in the forms attached hereto
as _Exhibits H and I_ , respectively, which shall become effective only upon
the effective time of the Merger.

  

(j)  Upon not less than 10 days' notice prior to the Closing
Date from Carolina Financial to First South, First South shall cause the
adoption of resolutions (which are acceptable to Carolina Financial) by each
applicable First South Entity's Board of Directors terminating, amending or
causing other appropriate modification of each First South Benefit Plan as
specified by Carolina Financial in such notice, effective as of the date
which immediately precedes the Closing Date or as of the Closing Date (as
shall be specified in such notice), provided that (a) First South shall be
required to take such action only with respect to First South Benefit Plans
that may unilaterally be terminated, amended or modified, as applicable, as
requested by Carolina Financial, by a First South Entity in accordance with
the terms of the plan and applicable Law, (b) First South shall not be
required to take such action if and to the extent it would cause a plan
participant to be denied a benefit, or vesting of a benefit, that the
participant would have been entitled to under the plan if the plan had not
been so terminated, amended or modified at or prior to the Effective Time;
and (c) for the avoidance of doubt, any reasonable costs or expenses that are
incurred by a First South Entity in connection with such termination,
amendment or modification (including without limitation the payment of any
benefits or compensation) shall be considered reasonable expenses incurred by
a First South Entity in connection with the Merger. Upon such action,
participants in such applicable First South Benefit Plans that are First
South ERISA Plans shall be 100% vested in their account balances or other
applicable plan benefits.

the defense thereof, except that if Carolina Financial or the Surviving
Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties advises that there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Carolina Financial or the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them, and Carolina Financial or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided, however,_ that

any settlement effected without its prior written consent and which does not

neither Carolina Financial nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of

reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (ii)
Carolina Financial and First South will each be a party to that
