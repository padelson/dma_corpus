herein individually as a "PARTY" and collectively as the "PARTIES."   
RECITALS   A. Ackerley is a corporation engaged in multiple businesses
that directly, and through its subsidiaries Media, SSI and Aviation, owns

to purchase from Sellers, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, those assets of Sellers described herein related to such
professional sports teams, other sports-related businesses and additional
businesses, and Sellers desire Buyer to assume certain of Sellers\'
obligations under certain specified agreements that are included among the
purchased assets, which Buyer would agree to assume on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein.   C. The Boards of Directors of each of
Buyer and each Seller believes it is in the best interests of its respective
organization and owners that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated and, in furtherance thereof, has approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.   D. Buyer and Sellers desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the covenants and representations set forth herein, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the Parties agree as follows:

which may have arisen or may arise out of any one or more events, conditions

the following liabilities and obligations of the Sellers (the
"ASSUMED OBLIGATIONS"):   (i) Subject to the prorations provided for in

Leases;   (ii) Subject to the prorations provided for in Section 1.3(b),
the liabilities and obligations which arise on or after the Closing as
a result of Buyer\'s operation of the Businesses and ownership of the
Purchased Assets on and following the Closing, including without limitation
liabilities and obligations arising as a result of the application of the
[CONSTITUTION AND BYLAWS] of the Associations.   (b) Except as specifically
provided in Section 1.2(a) of this Agreement, Buyer shall not assume any
debts, liabilities, Taxes or obligations of any of the Sellers, and all
debts, liabilities, Taxes and obligations of the Sellers not so assumed are
herein referred to as the "EXCLUDED LIABILITIES".    -4-    13  1.3
CONSIDERATION FOR PURCHASED ASSETS.   (a) Consideration. On the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as full payment for
the transfer of the Purchased Assets by Sellers to Buyer and for the
noncompetition covenant in Section 5.5, at the Closing, (i) Buyer shall
deliver to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount
of US $200 million plus the estimated balance due Seller or minus the
estimated balance due Buyer, as applicable, as calculated as of the Closing
and noted on SCHEDULE 1.3(b) hereto (the "CASH CONSIDERATION") and (ii) Buyer
shall assume all of the Assumed Obligations pursuant to Section 1.2 hereof
(the Cash Consideration and such assumption, collectively, the "PURCHASE
PRICE").   (b) Certain Closing and Post-Closing Prorations, Payments
and Adjustments. All items listed on the Schedule of Prorations, SCHEDULE
1.3(b) hereto, and such other items as the Parties shall agree upon, shall be
prorated between Buyer and the Seller, according to generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis with the
Financial Schedules except as otherwise set forth in SCHEDULE 1.3(b), as of
Midnight on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and the net
amount resulting from the foregoing in favor of Buyer or the Sellers, as the
case may be, shall then be paid to Buyer or the Sellers, as the case may be
at the Closing. If all the apportionments set forth above are not
accomplished at the Closing ("DELAYED PRORATIONS"), then, as soon as
practicable thereafter and no less often than on a quarterly basis,
representatives of the Sellers and Buyer shall examine all appropriate books
and records in order to make the determination of said apportionments.
Payments in respect thereof shall be made within ten (10) days after each
such determination, provided that if payments with respect to real
or personal property taxes are based in whole or in part on the previous
year\'s taxes, there shall be a later adjustment to reflect the current
year\'s taxes when the bills are finally rendered.   (c) Prorations and
Adjustments Disputes. In the event of any dispute between the parties as to
prorations or adjustments under this Section 1.3(b) the amounts not in
dispute shall nonetheless be paid and adjusted for at the Closing (or, in the
case of Delayed Prorations, as soon as practicable after a determination of
such proration may be made) and such disputes shall be subject to arbitration
pursuant to Section 9.12 hereof.   (d) Allocation of Purchase Price. The
Purchase Price shall be allocated in its entirety among the Businesses and to
the Purchased Assets and the noncompetition covenant in Section 5.5 as
determined by Buyer within one hundred eighty (180) days after Closing (the
"ALLOCATION"); provided, further that Buyer shall provide Sellers a written
copy of the Allocation; whereupon Sellers shall have ten (10) days to provide
written comments or recommendations with respect thereto and Buyer shall
consider in good faith all such comments and recommendations. After
consideration of Sellers\' comments and recommendations, and within ten (10)
days of receipt thereof, Buyer shall prepare a final Allocation which shall
be provided to Sellers. Sellers and Buyer shall comply with the applicable
information reporting requirements of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE") and the Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder and shall file all information and Tax returns (and
any amendments thereto) in a manner    -5-    14 consistent with the
final Allocation. If, contrary to the intent of the parties hereto as
expressed in this Section 1.3(e), any taxing authority makes or proposes an
allocation different from that determined in accordance with the terms of
this Section 1.3(e), Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in
good faith to contest such taxing authority\'s allocation (or
proposed allocation), provided, however, that after consultation with the
party adversely affected by such allocation (or proposed allocation), another
party hereto may file such protective claims or returns as may reasonably be
required to protect its interests.   1.4 SALES AND USE TAXES. Buyer shall
bear and pay any and all sales and use taxes provided for in Revised Code of
Washington Chapter 82.08 arising out of the transfer of the Purchased Assets
to Buyer pursuant hereto (the "BUYER TRANSFER TAXES"). To the extent
permitted by applicable law, Sellers shall cooperate fully with Buyer in
minimizing such Buyer Transfer Taxes. To the extent any Tax authority
provides notice of an audit of the Buyer Transfer Taxes, Buyer shall promptly
assume responsibility for such audit and shall bear and pay when due any
additional Buyer Transfer Taxes (plus interest and penalties determined to be
due thereon). Seller shall bear and pay any and all transfer taxes and
similar taxes arising out of the transfer of real property to Buyer pursuant
hereto.   1.5 CLOSING.   (a) Closing Place, Time and Date. Unless this
Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, the closing
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "CLOSING") shall be
held at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional

later of (i) February 15, 2001 or (ii) the date which is five (5) business

Article VI hereof, waiver of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article
VI hereof, or at such other place and such other time and/or date as the

as Sellers may reasonably request in order to effectively make   
-6-    15 Buyer responsible for all Assumed Obligations pursuant hereto to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.   (ii) At the Closing,
Sellers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer the following,
dated as of the Closing Date and executed for and on behalf of Sellers by a
duly authorized officer thereof:   (1) a bill of sale, in customary form and

of the Purchased Assets pursuant hereto to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law.   (c) Closing. The effective date of the transfer of the
Purchased Assets from Sellers to Buyer pursuant hereto shall be 12:01 a.m. of

be conducted by Buyer and the Purchased Assets shall by held for the account
and benefit, and at the risk, of Buyer.   1.6 NONTRANSFERABLE ASSETS. To
the extent that any Purchased Asset or Assumed Obligation to be sold,
conveyed, assigned, transferred, delivered or assumed to or by Buyer pursuant
hereto, or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom, is not capable of being sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred or
delivered without the approval, consent or waiver of the issuer thereof or
the other party thereto, or any third person (including a government or
governmental unit), or if such sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer or
delivery or attempted sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery
would constitute a breach or termination right thereof or a violation of any
law, decree, order, regulation or other governmental edict, except
as expressly otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall not constitute a
sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery thereof, or an attempted
sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery thereof absent such
approvals, consents or waivers. If any such approval, consent or waiver shall
not be obtained, or if an attempted assignment of any such Purchased Asset or
the assumption of any Assumed Liability by Buyer would be ineffective so that
Buyer would not in fact receive all such Purchased Assets or assume all such
Assumed Obligations pursuant hereto, Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate in a
mutually agreeable arrangement under which Buyer would obtain the benefits
and assume the    -7-    16 obligations of such Purchased Assets and
Assumed Obligations in accordance with this Agreement, including
subcontracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to Buyer, or under which
Seller, at Buyer\'s expense, would enforce for the benefit of Buyer, with
Buyer assuming all of Seller\'s obligations thereunder, any and all rights of
Sellers against a third party thereto. From and after the Closing, Sellers
shall promptly pay to Buyer when received all monies received by
Sellers under any Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder, except to the extent the same represents an Excluded
Asset hereunder, and Buyer shall promptly pay, perform and discharge when due
all Assumed Obligations; and Buyer shall indemnify and hold Sellers harmless
from any Claims associated with any such Purchased Asset, Assumed Obligation
or such arrangement. The failure of Sellers to obtain any third party consent
hereunder shall not affect the Purchase Price if the Closing shall occur.  
1.7 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION, FURTHER ACTION. From time to time after the
Closing Date, at the request of either Party hereto and at the expense
of such Party, the Parties hereto shall execute and deliver such other
instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation and
take such action as may be reasonably necessary to transfer, convey and
assign to Buyer, and to confirm Buyer\'s title to or interest in the
Purchased Assets, to put Buyer in actual possession and operating control
thereof and to assist Buyer in exercising all rights with respect thereto.
The Sellers hereby constitute and appoint Buyer and its successors and
assigns as its true and lawful attorney in fact in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this instrument, with full power of
substitution, in the name and stead of the Sellers but on behalf of and for
the benefit of the Buyer and its successors and assigns, to demand and
receive any and all of the assets, properties, rights and businesses

collect or reduce to possession or endorse any of the Purchased Assets and to
do all acts and things in relation to the Purchased Assets which the Buyer or
its successors or assigns reasonably deem desirable.   ARTICLE II

to each such agreement: (A) the agreement, with respect to Sellers and, to
Sellers\' knowledge, all other parties thereto, is legal, valid, binding,
enforceable, and in full force and effect in all respects; (B) neither
Sellers nor, to Sellers\' knowledge, any other party is in breach or default,
and no event has occurred, which with notice or lapse of time would
constitute a breach or default, or permit termination, modification, or
acceleration, under the agreement; (C) to Sellers\' knowledge, there is
no dispute regarding the scope of such agreement or performance under
such agreement; and (D) Sellers have not received notice that any party

27 determined adversely to Sellers, could reasonably be anticipated to have

manner so as not to interfere with its normal business operations, to
its business and operations. Neither such access, inspection and furnishing

the other Parties hereunder.   4.3 NOTICE OF DEVELOPMENTS. Sellers shall
give prompt notice to Buyer of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely to cause any
representation or warranty of Sellers contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing and (ii) any failure of

notify Buyer thereof and provide Buyer with the details thereof including the
identity of the Person or Persons making such offer or proposal, and will
keep Buyer fully informed of the status and details of any such offer of
proposal. Each of Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that this Section 4.4 was a
significant inducement for Buyer and Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
the absence of such provision would have resulted in either (i) a material
reduction in the Purchase Price to be paid to Sellers or (ii) a failure to
induce Buyer and Buyer to enter into this Agreement.   As used in this
Section 4.4, "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" shall mean a proposal or offer for a
merger, consolidation or other business combination involving an acquisition
of the Businesses or any material portion of the Purchased Assets.   4.5

be required for it to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii)

submissions required by the FAA for authority to enter into an aircraft use
agreement. If the FAA does not approve such Agreement, Buyer shall have the
right but not the obligation to purchase the Aircraft, as provided in Section

to Buyer regarding interim use of the Aircraft.   4.6 ASSOCIATION APPROVALS.

any authorizations, consents, and approvals of governments and governmental
agencies in connection with the matters identified in Sections 2.3 and 2.4 of
Seller Disclosure Letter or as otherwise required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   ARTICLE V   OTHER
AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS   5.1 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Parties hereto
hereby agrees to keep such information or knowledge obtained in any due
diligence or other investigation pursuant to the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement or the effectuation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
confidential; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to
information or knowledge which (a) a party can demonstrate was already
lawfully in its possession prior to the disclosure thereof by the other
party, (b) is generally known to the public and did not become so known
through any violation of law, (c) became known to the public through no fault
of such party, (d) is later lawfully acquired by such party from other
sources, (e) is required to be disclosed by order of court or government
agency with subpoena powers or (f) which is disclosed in the course of any
litigation between any of the parties hereto. This provision supercedes and
replaces any and all prior confidentiality agreements between or among
the Parties, or between or among any of them or their Affiliates.   5.2
ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS AND FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each Party hereto, at the
request of another Party hereto, shall execute and deliver such
other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be
necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Sellers commit to pay, in the ordinary
course of business, all debts, trade payables, taxes, and employee and other
expenses related to the Businesses for all periods prior to the Closing
Date.   5.3 COLLECTION OF SELLERS\' RECEIVABLES. Sellers hereby authorize
Buyer to collect the amounts reflected on SCHEDULE 5.3 hereto (which amounts
are estimated on such schedule) ("SELLERS\' RECEIVABLES") for the account of
Sellers for a period of six (6) months after the Closing Date ("COLLECTION
PERIOD"). Within ten (10) business days after the end of each calendar month
during the Collection Period, Buyer shall pay to Sellers all Sellers\'
Receivables collected by Buyer during the preceding calendar month on account
of Sellers\' Receivables, together with an itemized listing of each
receivable collected; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
Sellers\' Receivable is    -33-    42 paid to Buyer by check, Buyer
shall not be obligated to pay to Sellers any amount represented by such check
until such check has been finally paid by the payor bank of such check (Buyer
agrees to deposit any such check reasonably promptly upon receipt). If more
than $100,000 of Sellers\' Receivables remains uncollected or unpaid to
Sellers at the end of the Collection Period, Sellers may extend the
Collection Period for an additional six (6) months. Buyer shall use the same
best efforts to collect Sellers\' Receivables as it employs in its own
collection efforts, but shall not be required to refer any of
Sellers\' Receivables to a collection agency or an attorney for collection or
use any extraordinary means of collection and shall not assign, pledge or
grant a security interest in Sellers\' Receivables to any third party, claim
a security interest or other right in and to such receivables, or compromise,
settle, or adjust any account without receiving the written approval of
Sellers. From time to time after applying the collection efforts required
herein, Buyer may determine that a specific item cannot be collected and may
render the item to Sellers for further prosecution through a collection
agency or attorney. All payments received by Buyer from any person with
respect to a single invoice on which such person owes payments to both Buyer
and Sellers shall be applied by Buyer first to payment of the portion of such
invoice which is a Sellers\' Receivable. During the Collection Period,
Sellers shall make no direct solicitation of payment of the Sellers\'
Receivables except as provided herein. All of Sellers\' Receivables not
collected by Buyer shall be returned to Sellers at the end of the Collection
Period, and Buyer shall have no responsibility for the collection of any
Sellers\' Receivable after the end of the Collection Period.   5.4 RETAINED
EMPLOYEES; BENEFITS   (a) Retained Employees.   (i) On the Closing Date,
Sellers shall terminate the employment of all persons at that time employed
by any of the Businesses whose employment is not governed by the Collective
Bargaining Agreement or who are listed on SCHEDULE 5.4(a) hereto (such listed
employees, the "SCHEDULED EMPLOYEES"). Sellers shall use their best efforts
to cause each of the Scheduled Employees to agree to have his or her
employment contract with Sellers (or any Seller) assumed by Buyer and to
further agree that such contract shall not be deemed to have terminated as a
result of the transaction contemplated herein. Sellers shall obtain a waiver
or a similar representation from each Scheduled Employee that provides that
such Scheduled Employee agrees and acknowledges that his or her contract may
be assumed by Buyer. Buyer shall concurrently offer "at-will" employment to
be effective as of the Closing Date to all of such persons whose employment
is terminated by Sellers in accordance with the first sentence of this
Section 5.4(a)(i) on terms that are substantially similar in the aggregate as
those in effect prior to Closing. Each employee of the Sellers who so becomes
an employee of the Buyer shall be referred to hereafter as a "Retained
Employee." Retained Employees shall be eligible to participate in Buyer\'s
benefit programs to the extent consistent with Buyer\'s standard
human resource policies in effect from time to time. Buyer will grant full
credit under such programs for prior service with the Sellers for purposes
of eligibility, vesting, and benefit accrual; provided, however, (A) Buyer
receives adequate records from Sellers reflecting Retained Employees\'
service; and, (B)such service crediting shall be consistent with Seller\'s
policies, the applicable plan or program, and the providers and carriers
of    -34-    43 each such program agree to credit such service upon
request of Buyer; and (C) no such service crediting for any purpose shall
result in duplicate benefits or funding.   (ii) On the Closing Date,
Sellers shall pay to such terminated employees all amounts owing to them in
connection with their employment by Seller, whether or not then due,
including but not limited to, accrued wages, salaries, vacation pay and
expense reimbursement, and shall pay to the appropriate taxing authorities on
or before the date due any amounts required to be deposited with respect to
such payments to such terminated employees.   (iii) Written contracts
between any of the Sellers and each Team player governing the Seller\'s
employment of each Team player as a player on such Team shall be included in
the Assumed Contracts.   (b) 401(k) Plan Distribution. Sellers agree and
acknowledge that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will result in, and constitute, a distributable event pursuant to
Code Section 401(k)(10)(A)(ii) (the "Distributable Event") for all Employees
of Sellers who are participants in any tax-qualified plan that has a 401(k)
component maintained by Sellers prior to the Closing Date and, accordingly,
Sellers shall provide Buyer, in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer,
evidence that Sellers recognize the Distributable Event. Sellers further
agree that on or prior to the Closing Date, all of the accounts in Sellers\'
tax-qualified plan(s) of all Employees who cease to be employees of Sellers
as a result of, or in connection with, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be fully vested.   (c) COBRA
Obligations. Sellers agree and acknowledge that the selling group (as defined
in Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-3;(a)) of which they
are a part (the "Selling Group") will continue to offer a group health plan
to employees after the Closing Date and, accordingly, that Sellers and the
Selling Group shall be solely responsible for providing continuation coverage
under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended
("COBRA"), to those individuals who are MandA; qualified beneficiaries (as
defined in Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4;(a)) with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the
"MandA; Qualified Beneficiaries"). Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Buyer for, from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses,
costs, and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) relating to, arising out of,
or resulting from any and all COBRA obligations, liabilities and claims
related to MandA; Qualified Beneficiaries. Sellers further agree
and acknowledge that in the event that the Selling Group ceases to provide
any group health plan to any employee prior to the expiration of the
continuation coverage period for all MandA; Qualified Beneficiaries (pursuant
to Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-8;(c)), then Sellers
shall provide Buyer with (i) written notice of such cessation as far in
advance of such cessation as is reasonably practicable (and in any event, at
least thirty (30) days prior to such cessation), and (ii) all information
necessary or appropriate for Buyer to offer continuation coverage to such
MandA; Qualified Beneficiaries.   (d) Pension Plan Withdrawal Liability.
Sellers agree and acknowledge, pursuant to ERISA Section 4204(a)(1)(C), that
if Buyer withdraws from the National Basketball Association Players\' Pension
Plan and/or the National Basketball Association Pension Plan for
Coaches,    -35-    44 Assistant Coaches and Trainers (collectively,
the "NBA Plans") in a complete withdrawal, or partial withdrawal with respect
to operations of the Businesses, during the five (5) plan year period
commencing with the first plan year beginning after the Closing Date (such
five (5) plan year period to be determined separately with respect to each of
the NBA Plans), then Sellers shall be secondarily liable for any withdrawal
liability that they would have had to the NBA Plans with respect to the
operations of the Businesses (but for ERISA Section 4204) if the liability of
the Buyer with respect to the NBA Plans is not fully paid. Sellers further
agree and acknowledge that they shall be solely liable for, and shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer for, from and against, any and all
claims, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees)
relating to, arising out of, or resulting from the dissolution of the
remainder of Sellers\' operations such that additional requirements
with respect to withdrawal liability under the NBA Plans are imposed by the
NBA and/or the NBA Plans on Buyer and/or Sellers.   (e) Sellers agree that,
except as specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement, they shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer for, from and against any and all
claims, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees)
relating to or arising out of, or in connection with, any employee benefit
plan, program, policy, practice or arrangement (including, without
limitation, any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)
established, sponsored, maintained, administered, contributed to or required
to be contributed to at any time by any of the Sellers or Affiliates.   5.5
NONCOMPETITION. For a period ending upon the fifth anniversary of the Closing
Date (the "Restricted Period"), neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates
shall (a) engage, directly or indirectly in the Businesses anywhere in the
world or directly or indirectly, own an interest in, manage, operate, join,
control, lend money or render financial or other assistance to or participate
in or be connected with, as an officer, employee, partner, stockholder,
consultant or otherwise, any person or entity that competes with Buyer or its
Affiliates with respect to the Businesses; or (b) solicit, attempt to
solicit, induce or otherwise cause any employee of Buyer or any of
Buyer\'s Affiliates to terminate his or her employment with Buyer or any of
Buyer\'s Affiliates; provided, however, that, for the purposes of this
Section 5.5, ownership of securities having no more than five percent (5%) of
the outstanding voting power of any competitor which are listed on any
national securities exchange or traded actively in the national over-the-
counter market shall not be deemed to be in violation of the Section 5.5 so
long as the person owning such securities has no other connection or
relationship with such competitor.   5.6 EXTENSION. The Restricted Period
shall be extended by the length of any period during which any of the Sellers
are in breach of the terms of this Article V.   5.7 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
Sellers agree that money damages would not be sufficient remedy for any
breach of this Article V and that any such breach would cause Buyer and its
Affiliates irreparable harm. Accordingly, Sellers agree that Buyer and its
Affiliates shall be entitled to specific performance, injunctive relief or
other equitable remedy, without the requirement of posting a bond with
respect to an actual or threatened breach of this Article V. Such remedy
shall not be deemed to    -36-    45 be the exclusive remedy for other
breach of this Article V but shall be in addition to all other remedies
available at law or equity.   5.8 LIMITATIONS. In the event that the
covenants set forth in this Article V are more restrictive than permitted by
the laws of the jurisdiction in which Buyer or its Affiliates seeks
enforcement thereof, each of such covenants shall be deemed limited to the
extent permitted by such laws.   5.9 REASONABLE COOPERATION OF SELLER.
Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer to the extent reasonable with Buyer\'s
efforts to obtain any required approvals or consents from the Associations;
provided, however, that this Section 5.9 shall not obligate Sellers to incur
any additional expense or liability.   5.10 PRACTICE FACILITY SIGNATURE.
Sellers agree to, as soon as practicable, at Seller\'s sole expense, make any
modifications to (or, if necessary, replace) the signage at or relating to
the Practice Facility necessary to cause such signage to be in full

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations and warranties set forth
in this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Letter, the Buyer Disclosure Letter
or in any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement,
shall survive the Closing for a period ending on the one (1) year anniversary
of the Closing, except for those set forth in Section 2.9 relating to Taxes

Indemnity.   (i) Sellers agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify
and hold harmless Buyer and its Representatives and Affiliates (collectively,
the "BUYER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS") from against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees and expenses of investigation) (hereinafter individually a
"LOSS" and collectively "LOSSES" ) arising out of, or resulting from, or
incurred with respect to, (A) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty of Sellers contained in this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Letter
(as supplemented by any Seller Disclosure Supplement) or any certificate or
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (B) any failure by Sellers
to perform or comply with any covenant contained in this Agreement, or (C)
any Excluded Liabilities. Buyer and Sellers each acknowledge that such
Losses, if any, would relate to unresolved contingencies existing at the
Closing, which if resolved at the Closing would have led to a reduction in
the aggregate Purchase Price; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be
entitled to claim a Loss to the extent Buyer has received insurance proceeds
with respect to such Loss.   (ii) Sellers shall not have any liability or
obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Person for any Losses unless
and until Officer\'s Certificates (as hereinafter defined) shall have been
delivered with respect to Losses which equal or exceed $100,000 in the
aggregate for all Losses (the "BASKET AMOUNT"). Once the Basket Amount has
been reached, all subsequent Losses (including the first $100,000) are
recoverable up to a maximum of $20,000,000 (the "Seller Cap") Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer shall be entitled to indemnification without regard to
the Basket Amount with respect to any Losses with respect to Excluded
Liabilities and such Losses shall not be included in the calculation of the
Basket Amount and shall not be limited by the Seller Cap and such right to
indemnification shall not be limited by section 7.1.   (iii) Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit the liability (i) of Sellers for any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein if the Closing shall
not occur, to the extent that such breach (or breaches), individually or in
the aggregate, amount to a failure to fulfill a condition of closing pursuant
to Section 6.1 hereof, or (ii) of Sellers for any Losses arising out of fraud
or intentional misrepresentation by any Seller.   7.3 INDEMNIFICATION BY
BUYER.   (a) Indemnity. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this Section 7.3, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless, jointly and
severally, Sellers and any successors thereto ("SELLER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS")
from and against any and all Losses arising out of, or resulting from, or
incurred with respect to, (i) any breach of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements given or made by Buyer in this
Agreement, the Buyer Disclosure Letter (as supplemented by any Buyer
Disclosure Supplements) or any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant
to this Agreement, and (ii) any and all Assumed Obligations.    -41-   
50  (b) Limitation on Indemnification by Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Seller Indemnified Person shall
be entitled to indemnification from Buyer or Buyer hereunder, and Buyer shall
not be required to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Person hereunder, for any
Losses unless and until the total of all such Losses exceeds $100,000 in the
aggregate (at which time, Seller Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to
indemnification for all Losses) or for total losses in excess of $20,000,000;
provided, however, that these limitations on liability shall not apply to the
indemnities set forth in Section 7.3(a)(ii).   7.4 INDEMNIFICATION
PROCEDURES.   (a) The parties seeking indemnification under this Article
VII (the "Indemnified Parties") shall give notice to the parties from
whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Parties") of any claim,
whether solely between the parties or brought by a third party (a "Third
Party Claim"), specifying (i) the factual basis for the claim, and (ii) the
amount of the claim. If the claim relates to a Third Party Claim, notice
shall be given by the Indemnified Parties promptly after written notice of
the action, suit, or proceeding was given to the Indemnified Parties. In all
other circumstances, notice shall be given by the Indemnified Parties
promptly after they become aware of the facts giving rise to the claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Parties\' failure to give the
Indemnifying Parties timely notice shall not preclude the Indemnified Parties
from seeking indemnification from the Indemnifying Parties except to the
extent that Indemnified Parties\' failure has materially prejudiced the
Indemnifying Parties\' ability to defend the claim or litigation.   (b)
With respect to claims between the parties, following receipt of notice from
the Indemnified Parties of a claim, the Indemnifying Parties shall have
thirty (30) business days to make any investigation of the claim that the
Indemnifying Parties deem necessary or desirable. For the purposes of
this investigation, the Indemnified Parties agree to make available to
the Indemnifying Parties and/or their authorized representatives the
information relied upon by the Indemnified Parties to substantiate the claim.
If the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying Parties cannot agree as to
the validity and amount of the claim within the 30-day period (or any
mutually agreed upon extension thereof), the Indemnified Parties may seek
appropriate resolution pursuant to Section 9.12 hereof.   (c) The
Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to conduct and control, through
counsel of their choosing, the defense, compromise or settlement of any Third
Party Claim against any Indemnified Parties as to which indemnification will
be sought by such Indemnified Parties from any Indemnifying Parties
hereunder, and in any such case the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in
connection therewith and shall furnish such records, information
and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Parties
in connection therewith; provided, that (i) the Indemnified Parties
may participate, through counsel chosen by them and at their own expense, in
the defense of any such Third Party Claim as to which the Indemnifying
Parties have so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof; (b) the
Indemnifying Parties shall pay for the fees and expenses of such Indemnified
Parties\' counsel to the extent that such Indemnified Parties have been
advised by counsel that there is a reasonable likelihood of conflict of
interest between the Indemnified Parties and the    -42-   
51 Indemnifying Parties; (c) the Indemnifying Parties shall not have the
right to settle any Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnified
Parties unless such settlement (A) releases the Indemnified Parties from all
past and future liability concerning the subject matter of the action and
(ii) has no adverse effect on the business or assets of the Indemnified
Parties; and (d) the Indemnifying Parties shall have no right to conduct or
control any defense of a claim brought by a Governmental Body without the
consent of the Indemnified Party. So long as the Indemnifying Parties are
defending in good faith any Third Party Claim as to which indemnification has
been sought hereunder, the Indemnified Parties shall not settle or compromise
such Third Party Claim. Each party shall cooperate, and cause their
respective affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any
Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records,
information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearing, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.   (d) If any Indemnified Party receives any payment
from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any indemnifiable Losses pursuant to
Section 7.2 or 7.3 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or part
of such Losses from a third party (a "POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTOR") based on the
underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential
Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.   ARTICLE VIII

terminate this Agreement by written notice if there shall be any action
taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or

Agreement by any Governmental Body, which would    -43-    52 (i)
prohibit Buyer\'s ownership or operation of all or a portion of
the Businesses or the Purchased Assets or (ii) compel Buyer to dispose of or
hold separate all or a portion of the Businesses or Purchased Assets as a

that, no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its
nature cannot be cured;   (e) Sellers may terminate this Agreement by
written notice if it is not in material breach of its obligations under this

after written notice to Buyer; provided, however, that no cure period shall
be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured;   (f) Buyer
may terminate this Agreement by written notice if an event having a material
adverse effect on Sellers or on the Purchased Assets shall have occurred
after the date of this Agreement.   8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If any Party
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 above, all rights and
obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without any liability of
any Party to any other Party (except for any liability of any Party then in
breach); provided that each Party shall remain liable for any willful
breaches of this Agreement prior to its termination and provided, further,
that the provisions contained in Section 5.1 (confidentiality) and Section 9
(miscellaneous) shall survive termination.   ARTICLE IX  
MISCELLANEOUS   9.1 PRESS RELEASES AND PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. No Party shall
issue any press release or make any public announcement relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement prior to the Closing without the prior
written approval of the other Party; provided, however, that Sellers may
correspond with third parties in writings in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer with respect to obtaining consents from such parties
pursuant to Sections 4.8 and 6.1(f). In furtherance of the foregoing
sentence, the Parties agree and acknowledge that Buyer will issue a press

specifically related to Sellers.    -44-    53  9.2 NO THIRD-PARTY

permitted assigns, other than as specifically set forth herein.   9.3 ENTIRE

successor thereto by execution of an instrument in writing.   9.5 WAIVERS.
The rights and remedies of the Parties to this Agreement are cumulative and
not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising
any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred

privilege, and no single or partial exercise of such right, power,
or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right,
power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (i) no claim or right
arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement
can be discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or
renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other
Party; (ii) no waiver that may be given by a Party will be applicable except
in the specific instance for which it is given; and (iii) no notice to or
demand on one Party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such
Party or of the right of the Party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement.   9.6 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The
parties to this Agreement acknowledge that it may be impossible to measure in
money the damages that a party would incur if any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms
and agree that each of the parties hereto shall be entitled to obtain an
injunction to require specific performance of, and prevent any violation of
the terms of, this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy available

Agreement, each party hereby waives any claim or defense therein that
an adequate remedy at law or in damages exists.   9.7 SUCCESSORS AND
ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties named herein and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Sellers may (i) assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to

Any Party may change the address to which notices, requests, demands, claims,
and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other
Parties ten (10) days\' advance written notice to the other Parties pursuant
to the provisions above.   9.11 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State
of Washington without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Washington or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Washington.   9.12 ARBITRATION. From
and after the Closing, any claim or dispute arising out of or related to this
Agreement, or the interpretation, making, performance, breach or termination
thereof, shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in King County,
Washington in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules
of the American Arbitration Association conducted by one arbitrator mutually
agreeable to the parties to such dispute. In the event that within forty-five
(45) days after submission of any dispute to arbitration, the Parties cannot
mutually agree on one arbitrator, the parties to the dispute shall each
select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a
third arbitrator and the dispute shall be resolved by the panel of three
arbitrators. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a
limited time period not to exceed forty-five (45) days and establish
procedures designed to limit the cost and time for discovery while allowing
the parties to the dispute an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgement of
the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to
discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of the dispute. The arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators,
as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and
shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys\' fees and
costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the
arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may
be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or
that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification.
The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer\'s
Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the Parties to this
Agreement.    -47-    56 Judgment upon any award rendered by the
arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each Party to
any arbitration pursuant to this Section 9.12 shall pay its own expenses; the
fees of each arbitrator and the administrative fee of the American
Arbitration Association shall be borne equally by the parties to the dispute.
Nothing contained in this Section shall limit the Parties\' rights to
injunctive relief or to specific performance.   9.13 SEVERABILITY. Any term
or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any
situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or
enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or
in any other jurisdiction.   9.14 EXPENSES. Each Party will bear its own
costs and expenses (including legal and accounting fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.   9.15 CONSTRUCTION. The Parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity
or questions of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any
federal, state, local, or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. The work "including" shall mean including without
limitation.   9.16 SELLER DISCLOSURE LETTER.   (a) All disclosures in the
Seller Disclosure Letter are made generally, and none of such disclosures
relates to any particular Section of Article II. All disclosures in the Buyer
Disclosure Letter are made generally, and none of such disclosures relates to
any particular Section of Article III. Accordingly, any numbering or
references in the Seller Disclosure Letter and the Buyer Disclosure Letter
are for convenience only and do not in any way limit, and shall not be
regarded as limiting, the disclosure concerning such numbered or referred to
Sections.   (b) In the event of any inconsistency between the statements
in the body of this Agreement and those in Seller Disclosure Letter (other
than an exception expressly set forth as such in Seller Disclosure Letter
with respect to a specifically identified representation or warranty), the
statements in the body of this Agreement will control.   (c) Statements
contained within the Seller Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be
representations and warranties under this Agreement, including, without
limitation, Article VII.   9.17 ATTORNEYS\' FEES. If any legal proceeding or
other action relating to this Agreement is brought or otherwise initiated,
the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees,
costs and disbursements (in addition to any other relief to which the
prevailing Party may be entitled).    -48-    57  9.18 FURTHER
ASSURANCES. The Parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to each other such
further information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other such other
documents, and (c) to do such other acts and things, all as the other Party
may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of
this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.   9.19 TIME

to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.    -49-    58  IN WITNESS
