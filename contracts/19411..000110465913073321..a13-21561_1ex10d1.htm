the Closing Date Net Working Capital Target exceeds the Closing Date Net
Working Capital, if applicable, minus (iii) the Closing Date Indebtedness
(defined in _Section 9.12(a)_), minus (iv) the Transaction Expenses, as

estimates of (A) the Closing Date Net Working Capital (" **Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital** "), (B) the Estimated Producer Escrow Amount and
(C) the Transaction Expenses (the " **Estimated Transaction Expenses** ").
Such statement (the " **Estimated Closing Statement** ") also shall set forth
the amount of the Closing Date Indebtedness, if applicable. The Estimated
Closing Statement shall be certified by each Manager and shall be accompanied

Section 2.3. _Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to the Holder Representative a statement setting forth Parents good
faith calculations (" **Parent s Proposed Calculations**") of the Closing
Date Net Working Capital and the Transaction Expenses (the " **Final Closing
Statement** "). Following the delivery of such statement, Parents personnel
and independent accountants shall permit the Holder Representatives agents,
representatives and accountants, subject to the execution by the Holder
Representative and/or the Holder Representatives agents, representatives and
accountants of any release or indemnification agreement required by Parents
accountants, to review and make copies of all work papers, schedules and
calculations used in the preparation thereof.

 



 

(b) If, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Final Closing
Statement, the Holder Representative disputes any aspect of the Final Closing
Statement or any of Parents Proposed Calculations, then the Holder
Representative shall, on or prior to such thirtieth (30th) day, deliver to
Parent written notice of such dispute (the " **Dispute Notice** "). If the
Holder Representative does not deliver a Dispute Notice to Parent on or prior
to such thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the Final Closing Statement,
the Final Closing Statement delivered by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_
above shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and such thirtieth
(30th) day shall be deemed to be the " **Determination Date**." Any Dispute
Notice shall be accompanied by the Holder Representatives proposed
alternative calculations (the " **Holder Representative Proposed
Calculations** ") of the Closing Date Net Working Capital and the Transaction
Expenses. Parent and the Holder Representative shall, for a period of thirty
(30) days following Parents receipt of the Holder Representative Proposed
Calculations, cooperate in good faith to determine a mutually agreeable Final
Closing Statement, which shall be final and binding upon the parties. The date
upon which such Final Closing Statement is mutually agreed to by Parent and
the Holder Representative shall be deemed to be the " **Determination Date**."
If no such agreement is reached within such thirty (30) day period, then
within fifteen (15) days of

 



      
 

 



 

the expiration of such period, the Holder Representative and Parent shall
select a mutually acceptable and nationally recognized independent accounting
firm, other than the Holder Representatives independent accountants and
Parents independent accountants (such firm, the " **Independent Accounting
Firm** ") to resolve the remaining disputed items (the " **Remaining Disputed
Items** "), within thirty (30) days of its appointment, by (x) conducting its
own review and test of the Final Closing Statement and thereafter selecting
either Parents Proposed Calculations of the Remaining Disputed Items or the
Holder Representative Proposed Calculations of the Remaining Disputed Items or
an amount in between the two and (y) delivering to Parent and the Holder
Representative a revised Final Closing Statement reflecting the Independent
Accounting Firms final determination of the Remaining Disputed Items pursuant
to clause (x), which Final Closing Statement shall be final and binding upon
the parties hereto. The date on which the Independent Accounting Firm delivers
such Final Closing Statement shall be deemed to be the " **Determination
Date**." The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
borne by the party whose calculations of the Remaining Disputed Items (a) are
not selected by the Independent Accounting Firm in its final determination of
the Remaining Disputed Items or (b) differ by the greater amount from the
Independent Accounting Firms final determination of the Remaining Disputed
Items. The parties will submit such materials and respond to such questions as
requested by the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting
Firms report will be based (to the extent the Independent Accounting Firm
considers it appropriate) on such information and on the accounting and other
records of the Company. The Independent Accounting Firms award will consist
solely of an award with respect to the Remaining Disputed Items and will not
include any other finding or award.

 



 

(c) The " **Adjustment Amount** ," which may be positive or negative, shall
mean (i) Closing Date Net Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.3(b)_ above), minus the Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital, minus (ii) the Transaction Expenses (as finally determined pursuant
to _Section 2.3(b)_ above) minus the Estimated Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(d) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number (such amount, the "
**Increase Amount** "), then promptly following the Determination Date, and in
any event within five (5) business days of the Determination Date, Parent
shall pay directly to the Class V Holders, allocated in accordance with the
applicable Future Payment Allocation Schedule (defined in _Section 2.4(b)_),
an amount sufficient to pay the Increase Amount.

 



 

(e) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the absolute value of such
amount, the " **Deficit Amount** "), then promptly following the Determination
Date, and in any event within five (5) business days of the Determination
Date, Parent and the Holder Representative shall execute joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent (defined in _Section 2.4(c)_) instructing
the Escrow Agent to pay to Parent out of the General Escrow Fund an amount
equal to the Deficit Amount.

 



 

(f) Within the longer of (i) sixty (60) days after the Closing Date or (ii)
ten (10) business days after the Determination Date, the Holder Representative
shall prepare and deliver to Parent a statement setting the proposed final
Producer Escrow Amount, subject to the approval of Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). The final Producer Escrow

 



      
 

 



 

Amount shall take into account, if applicable, any Adjustment Amount. In the
event of a disagreement between Parent and the Holder Representative with
respect to the final Producer Escrow Amount, the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be appointed to resolve such disagreement in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 2.3(b)_ hereof, and the Independent Accounting Firms
determination of the final Producer Escrow Amount shall be final and binding
on the parties. To the extent the final Producer Escrow Amount is less than
the Estimated Producer Escrow Amount (such difference, the " **Re-Calculated
Producer Escrow Adjustment** "), promptly following the date on which the
final Producer Escrow Amount is determined (the " **Re-Calculated Producer
Escrow Date** ") and in any event within five (5) business days of the Re-
Calculated Producer Escrow Date, Parent and the Holder Representative shall
execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to pay to the Class V Holders out of the Producer Escrow Fund to the
Class V Holders, allocated in accordance with the applicable Future Payment
Allocation Schedule (defined in _Section 2.4(b)_), an amount equal to the Re-
Calculated Producer Escrow Adjustment.

obligated to make the corresponding payments until such time as it receives
the applicable schedule. Each Future Payment Allocation Schedule will be
prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Company Organizational
Documents, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
(defined in _Section 2.4(c)_), and certified by the Holder Representative in

Merger Consideration equal to the sum of the General Escrow Amount and the
Estimated Producer Escrow Amount to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as

amounts referred to in clause (i), referred to as " **CEP Payments** ")
pursuant to agreements listed on subsection (xv) of _Section 3.14(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedules (" **Producer CEP Agreements** "); _provided,
however,_ that the General Escrow Participation Percentage of the full CEP
Payment otherwise actually earned by, and due and payable to, a Producer (as
adjusted herein, the " **Escrowed CEP Payment Amount** ") (I) shall not be

(e) _CEP Payments from Producer Escrow Fund_. The timing and amounts of such
CEP Payments from the Producer Escrow Fund shall be determined in accordance
with the terms of the applicable Producer CEP Agreements, as such
determination is mutually approved by both Parent and the Holder

remaining in the Producer Escrow Fund no longer necessary to pay or satisfy
CEP Payment obligations to the Producers, as determined from time to time by
the Holder Representative and approved by Parent (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), shall be referred to herein as " **Excess

the Holder Representative with respect to any Excess Producer Escrow Amount,
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be appointed to resolve such
disagreement in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.3(b)_ hereof,
and the Independent Accounting Firms determination of any Excess Producer

otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it
reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Law with respect
to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company or the Escrow Agent, as the case

deliver to the Holder Representative its determination of the allocation of
the Allocable Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ (the "

the parties hereto; provided, however, that any allocation in the Allocation
Schedule to any item of property described in Section 751(a) of the Code (a "
**Hot Asset** ") in excess of such Hot Assets book value shall be subject to
the review and agreement of the Holder Representative. Neither Parent nor any
Represented Holder shall take any position (whether in connection with audits,
Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with this _Section 2.5_ and
the Allocation Schedule, except as may be required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or similar
provision of state, local or non-United States Tax law).

reflect any such adjustment using the same methodology as used in the initial
Allocation Schedule and shall

incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of Parent or Merger
Sub or (ii) assuming that the authorizations, consents and approvals referred
to in _Section 4.3_ are obtained and the filings referred to in _Section
4.3_ are made, (x) violate any Law, judgment, writ or injunction of any
Governmental Authority or any arbitration award applicable to Parent or any of

termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets of, Parent or Merger Sub under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party, or by
which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
affected that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform, in a
timely manner, its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions.

for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub or
the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions, other than such
other consents, approvals, filings, declarations or registrations that, if not

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
Parent.

 



 

Section 4.4. _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub_. Parent owns through one
of its other wholly-owned Subsidiaries beneficially all of the outstanding

investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against
Parent or Merger Sub and neither Parent nor Merger Sub is subject to any
outstanding order, writ, judgment, injunction or decree of any Governmental
Authority that, in either case, would be reasonably likely, individually or in
the aggregate, to (a) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger or (b) otherwise prevent or materially delay performance by Parent or
Merger Sub of any closing condition set forth in _Section 6.3_ or of their
material obligations under this Agreement.

conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries, requests
or other contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written
materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal,
offer, inquiry, request or other contact).

5.3(d)_), each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties

purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event within five (5) business days of the date hereof
and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
consistent with this _Section 5.3_ necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable. Parent and the Company shall share equally the fees incurred by
Parent and the Company in connection with the aforementioned filings under the
HSR Act.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other party in connection with any filing
or submission with or to a Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or
before a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other parties
informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any
material communication received by such party from, or given by such party to,
the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, each of the parties hereto shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent reasonably practicable each

case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the
Company shall not, without Parents prior written consent, commit to any
divestiture transaction or agree to any change of or restriction on its
business, and nothing in this _Section 5.3_ shall (i) limit any applicable
rights a party may have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_
so long as such party has up to then complied in all material respects with
its obligations under this _Section 5.3_ or (ii) require Parent to offer,
accept or agree to (A) dispose of or hold separate any part of its or the
Companys business, operations, assets or product lines (or a combination of

and/or (C) restrict or change the manner in which, or whether, Parent, the

Section 5.4. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the
Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or
the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be
required by Law or in the case of Parent by its listing agreement with any
securities exchange as determined in its good faith judgment (in which case
such party shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release or
other public announcement without prior consultation insofar as practicable
with the Company).

 



 

Section 5.5. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company agrees that, prior
to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VII_, Parent and its Representatives shall be entitled to make such
investigation of the properties, assets, businesses and operations of the
Company and such examination of the books, records and financial condition of
the Company as Parent reasonably requests, and to make extracts and copies of
such books and records. No investigation by Parent prior to or after the date
of this Agreement shall diminish or obviate any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or the Holder
Representative contained in this Agreement or the Company Documents. Any such
investigation by Parent shall not unreasonably interfere with any of the
businesses or operations of the Company. In order that Parent may have full
opportunity to make such physical, business, accounting and legal review,
examination or investigation as it may reasonably request regarding the
affairs of the Company, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause its Representatives to cooperate fully with Parents Representatives
in connection with such review and examination. Parent and its Representatives
shall hold information received from the Company pursuant to this _Section
5.5_ in confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.6. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt written notice to the
Company, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions, (ii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against or otherwise involving such party or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates which relate to the Transactions, (iii) the
discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause
any representation or warranty made by such party contained in this Agreement
(A) that is qualified as to materiality to be untrue or (B) that is not so
qualified to be untrue in any material respect or, in the case of the Company,
would cause any of the information provided in the Company Disclosure
Schedules to not be true and correct as of the time such information was
provided in light of such discovery or occurrence or non-occurrence, and (iv)
any material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided,
however,_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6_
shall not (x) cure any breach of any representation of warranty of the party
giving such notice or any non-compliance by the party giving such notice with
any covenant, agreement or other provision

 



      
 

 



 

contained in this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to the party
receiving such notice in respect of such breach or non-compliance.

 



 

Section 5.7. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as may otherwise be provided herein,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger
and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 



 

Section 5.8. _Change In Control Customer Contracts_. The Company shall, prior
to the Closing Date, (i) notify each third party to the Change In Control
Customer Contracts listed on _Section 3.14(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules of the Transactions and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
request and receive a waiver, if required, of any termination rights arising
as a result of the Transactions from each such party.

 



 

Section 5.9. _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns of the
Company for Pre-Closing Tax Periods. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with past practice; provided that there is a reasonable
basis for the positions claimed on such Tax Returns. The Company shall deliver
to Parent copies of each such Tax Return at least twenty (20) days prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Return, and shall permit Parent to review and
approve such Tax Return prior to filing (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). To the extent that any such Tax Return is
required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall timely
file such Tax Return. If any such Tax Return is required to be filed by the
Company after the Closing Date, Parent shall timely file such Tax Return. If
the parties have not resolved any dispute relating to any such Tax Return
prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, then the Company or Parent,
as applicable, shall file such Tax Return as prepared, but such filing shall
not prejudice the rights of any party to pursue such dispute. The Company
shall timely pay (or cause to be paid) to the applicable Taxing Authority all
Taxes shown to be due on any Tax Return described in this _Section 5.9(a)_.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing, Parent shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and
file (or cause to be filed) when due (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to
the Company after the Closing Date in respect of any Straddle Period. A copy
of any such material Tax Return shall be delivered to the Holder
Representative at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Return, and shall permit the Holder Representative to review and approve
such Tax Return prior to filing (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). If the parties have not resolved any dispute relating to
any such Tax Return prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, then
Parent shall file such Tax Return as prepared, but such filing shall not
prejudice the rights of any party to pursue such dispute. The Holder
Representative, on behalf of the Represented Holders, shall remit to the
Parent their portion of the Taxes in accordance with _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_
with respect to any such Tax Returns not later than five (5) days prior to the
due date for filing such Tax Returns (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained).

 



 

(c) In order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to Straddle
Periods, the parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
elect with the relevant Taxing

 



       
 

 



 

Authority to treat for all purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a
taxable period of the Company (a " **Short Period** "). In any case where
applicable Law does not permit the Company to treat the Closing Date as the
last day of a Short Period, then for purposes of this Agreement, the portion
of each Tax that is attributable to the operations of the Company for the
period which would have qualified as a Short Period if such election had been
permitted by applicable Law (an " **Interim Period** ") shall be (i) in the
case of any property Tax, ad valorem Tax, or exemption, allowance or deduction
that is calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to,
depreciation and amortization deductions), the total amount of such Tax or
item for the period in question multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Interim Period, and the denominator of
which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period, and (ii) in the
case of any Tax or item not described in clause (i), the Tax that would be due
with respect to the Interim Period if such Interim Period were a Short Period
determined based upon an interim closing of the books.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent shall have the sole right to control, through counsel of its own
choosing, the defense or settlement of any claim or proceeding relating to a
Tax matter resulting in a Loss; provided that, with respect to any such Loss
for which the Holder Representative otherwise shall be liable under the
indemnification provisions hereunder, Parent (i) shall keep the Holder
Representative apprised of all developments relating to such claim or
proceeding, (ii) shall provide the Holder Representative with copies of all
correspondence from any taxing authority relating to any such claim or
proceeding, (iii) shall provide the Holder Representative in advance with any
proposed submission relating to such claim or proceeding, (iv) shall consult
with the Holder Representative in good faith concerning any such submission
and the conduct of the proceeding, and (v) shall not finally settle any such
claim or proceeding without the prior written consent of Holder Representative
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the event of
any conflict between the terms of this _Section 5.9(d)_ and _Section 8.5_,
the terms of this _Section 5.9(d)_ shall govern.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all transfer,
stamp, sales, value added, and use taxes, and similar taxes, assessments,
levies, tariffs, imposts, tolls, customs, duties, export and import fees and
charges, registration fees, and any similar costs incurred and payable under
applicable Law applicable to, or resulting from, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including any related interest, fines, and penalties, if
any (collectively, " ** _Transfer Taxes_** "), shall be shared equally by
Parent and the Holder Representative, as agent for the Company Holders
(provided that Parent shall also have the right to claim such amount owed by
the Holder Representative on behalf of the Company Holders from the General
Escrow Fund). The parties shall cooperate to pay such Transfer Taxes when due,
and file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
such Transfer Taxes as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(f) Each party hereto agrees to co-operate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of any
Tax Returns, any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
The parties further agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or

 



      
 

 



 

eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.10. _Related Party Transactions_. As of the Closing Date, all
transactions, agreements, relationships and payments set forth on _Section
3.21_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules (except for the Monte Cristo Lease
as modified effective as of the Closing and the Companys arrangements with
Diversified Health Care Services, Inc. as set forth on _Section 3.21_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedules) shall be terminated without any further
obligation of the Company and appropriate releases will be delivered in favor
of the Company.

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the date that
is ninety (90) days following the date of this Agreement (the " **Walk-Away
Date** "), _provided that_ the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to a party if the failure of the
Merger to have been consummated on or before the Walk-Away Date was primarily
due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this

representations and warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing until the eighteen (18)-month anniversary of the Closing
Date. The representations and warranties of the Company contained in this

and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 3.11 _(Taxes) and
_Section 3.19 _(Health Care Regulatory Compliance) shall survive the Closing
until ninety (90) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Section 3.3(b)_ (CEP Payments) shall survive indefinitely. The termination
of the representations and warranties provided herein shall not affect the
rights of a party in respect of any claim made by such party in a writing
received by the other party prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period provided herein. All agreements and covenants contained herein which by
their terms contemplate actions or impose obligations following the Closing
shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect in accordance

Section 8.2. _Right to Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Subject in all cases to the limits on indemnification in this _Article
VIII_, subsequent to the Closing, the Company Holders at the Effective Time
(the " **Company Holder Indemnitors** ") shall severally, and not jointly, in
proportion to the amount of General Escrow Amount then-remaining in the
General Escrow Fund to which they are or may be entitled, indemnify Parent,
its Affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, managers,
employees, stockholders, agents and other Representatives (" **Parent
Indemnitees** ") against, and hold each of the Parent Indemnitees harmless
from, any Losses to the extent incident or related to or arising out of or in
connection with:

 



 

(i) the failure of any representation or warranty of the Company in this
Agreement to be true and correct as of the date hereof and as of the Closing
Date, or if expressly made as of an earlier date, as of such date (without
giving effect to any materiality or similar qualification contained or
incorporated directly or indirectly in any representation or warranty);

 



 

(ii) the breach of any agreement, covenant or obligation of the Company set
forth in this Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) (A) any Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company (or for which
the Company could otherwise be liable) for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods
(including Taxes attributable to the portion of any Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and including any Taxes arising by reason of the transactions
contemplated hereby or the Closing itself) and (B) Taxes imposed on the
Company by reason of the application of Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6(a) (or any analogous or similar provision of Law) as a result of
being a member of a consolidated, combined or unitary group of entities on or
before the Closing Date; (collectively " **Damages** ").

 



 

(b) Parent shall indemnify the Company Holders as of the Effective Time
against, and hold each of such Company Holders harmless from, any Losses
actually paid to third parties or incurred by a Company Holder to the extent
that such Losses are incident or related to or arise out of or in connection
with:

 



 

(i) the failure of any representation or warranty of Parent in this Agreement
to be true and correct as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, or if
expressly made as of an earlier date, as of such date; and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) the breach of any agreement, covenant or obligation of Parent set forth
in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.3. _Escrow; Threshold; Limitations on Indemnity_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) The maximum Liability of the Company Holders under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ 
_(iii)_ (excluding any Liability in respect of a breach of _Section 3.3(b)_,
_Section 3.11_, or _Section 3.19_, which shall not be subject to any limit)
shall be that portion of the General Escrow Amount then-remaining in the
General Escrow Fund; _provided however_ that, to the extent the General Escrow
Fund is not available to pay and satisfy the indemnification obligations
pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ by reason of a breach of _Section 3.3(b)_,
_Section 3.11_, or _Section 3.19_ (an " **Unavailable Amount** "), each
Class V Holder shall be liable to Parent for a percentage of such Unavailable
Amount equal to the percentage of the Merger Consideration then received by
such Company Holder relative to the total Merger Consideration, and the
aggregate balance of any such Unavailable Amount shall be remain recoverable
exclusively from the Producers as provided in the terms of the applicable
Producer Agreements (all rights thereto expressly remaining exclusively with
the Company).

 



 

(ii) The amount in the General Escrow Fund shall be disbursed to the Class V
Holders and (to the extent applicable) the Producers as follows on the date
that is five (5) business days following the eighteen (18)-month anniversary
of the Closing Date (the " **Release Date** "): the difference, if positive,
obtained by subtracting from the remaining funds in the General Escrow Fund an
amount equal to the aggregate amount of unsatisfied claims for Damages of
Parent Indemnitees under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_  _(iii)_ properly made on or
prior to the Release Date in accordance with the provisions of this _Article
VIII_ and the Escrow Agreement; _provided, however,_ that an amount equal to
the corresponding aggregate Transferred Escrowed Potential CEP Payment Amounts
shall be disbursed to the Producer Escrow Fund. Further, from and after the
Release Date, to the extent that (A) any amounts have been withheld in respect
of such unsatisfied claims and (B) the applicable underlying claims are
resolved in favor of the Company Holders, such amounts shall be promptly
disbursed to the Class V Holders and (to the extent applicable) the Producers
and Producer Escrow Fund in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_. Any
disbursement to the Class V Holders and (to the extent applicable, Producers)
made pursuant to this _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ shall constitute a " **General
Escrow Payment**."

 



 

(iii) No payment from the General Escrow Fund with respect to any Damages
otherwise payable under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ shall be payable until such time
as all such Damages shall aggregate to more than $500,000 (the " **Damage
Threshold** "), after which time the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder only to the extent such Damages exceed the Damage
Threshold; _provided_ that the Damage Threshold shall not apply to any Damages
related to the failure of any of the Fundamental Representations to be true
and correct. For the avoidance of doubt, the Damage Threshold shall not apply
to any claims for indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_  _(iii)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) No payment from the General Escrow Fund with respect to any particular
Damage otherwise payable under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ shall be payable unless
such Damage (including any series of related Damages) equals or exceeds
$25,000 (the " **De Minimis Threshold** "); _provided_ , that the De Minimis
Threshold shall not apply to any Damages related to the failure of any of the
Fundamental Representations to be true and correct. For avoidance of doubt,
the De Minimis Threshold shall not apply to any claims for indemnification
under _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_  _(iii)_.

 



 

(b) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Absent fraud or intentional
misrepresentation, the indemnification provisions contained in this _Article
VIII_ are intended to provide the sole and exclusive remedy following the
Closing as to all money damages for any action arising out of the subject
matter of this Agreement (it being understood that nothing in this _Section
8.3(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall affect the parties rights to
specific performance or other injunctive relief to enforce the parties
obligations under this Agreement).

 



 

Section 8.4. _No Right of Contribution_. After the Closing, the Company Holder
Indemnitors shall have no right of contribution against Parent or the
Surviving Company for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Company.

 



 

Section 8.5. _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Indemnification Notices_. In order to obtain indemnity in respect of a
Loss as provided by this _Article VIII_, a party (a " **Claimant** ") shall
give an "Indemnification Notice" to the other party. For the purposes hereof,
an " **Indemnification Notice** " shall mean a notice signed by any officer of
the Claimant and delivered to the other party and (i) stating that the
Claimant has paid, incurred, sustained or accrued, or reasonably anticipates
that it will be obligated to pay, incur, sustain or accrue, a Loss against
which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder, (ii) specifying in
reasonable detail the nature of such Loss (including the calculation thereof
or the basis for estimation thereof), the date insofar as practicable such
Loss was paid or is expected to be incurred, sustained or accrued or the basis
on which it anticipates incurring, sustaining or accruing such Loss, and the
nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant, Tax matter or
other matter resulting in such Loss or out of which such Loss arose or to
which such Loss relates, and (iii) specifying the amount of cash to be
delivered to the Claimant (for the benefit of the pertinent Parent Indemnitee
or Company Holders) as indemnity against each such Loss. If a Loss is
anticipated but not yet incurred, sustained or accrued at the time an
Indemnification Notice is given, an additional Indemnification Notice shall be
given providing such information regarding the Loss incurred, sustained or
accrued as was not included in an earlier Indemnification Notice. In the case
where a Parent Indemnitee other than Parent shall seek to obtain the indemnity
provided by _Section 8.2_, Parent shall give an appropriate Indemnification
Notice on behalf of such Parent Indemnitee, provided that such Parent
Indemnitee has provided to Parent such information as Parent may reasonably
request for such purpose. In the case where a Company Holder shall seek to
obtain the indemnity provided by _Section 8.2_, Holder Representative shall
give an appropriate Indemnification Notice on behalf of such Company Holder,
provided that such Company Holder has provided to the Holder Representative
such information as the Holder Representative may reasonably request for such
purpose.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Third-Party Claims_.

 



 

(i) Parent (on behalf of itself and/or any Parent Indemnitee) or the Holder
Representative (on behalf of Company Holders) (as applicable, the "
**Indemnitee** ") shall give the other (the " **Indemnifying Party** ")
written notice (a " **Third Party Claim Notice** ", which may be part of an
Indemnification Notice) of any claim, assertion or action by or in respect of
a third party, including any civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory,
investigative or arbitral proceeding (a " **Third Party Claim** "), as to
which an Indemnitee may request indemnification hereunder or as to which the
Damages Threshold may be applied as soon as is practicable and in any event
within fifteen (15) days of the time that such Indemnitee learns of such Third
Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not affect the rights of the Indemnitee to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnified Party (as
such) is actually prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall
have the right, at its sole option and expense, to assume control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim that relates to any Losses with respect to
which the Indemnifying Party has acknowledged in writing its obligation to
provide indemnification for hereunder, and to employ counsel of its choosing
in connection therewith, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee; _provided, however_ , that the Holder Representative shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (unless otherwise
consented to in writing by Parent) if (A) the Third Party Claim relates to or
arises in connection with an action, suit, proceeding or claim that is
criminal in nature or being brought by a Governmental Authority, (B) the Third
Party Claim seeks an injunction restricting the conduct of the Companys
business, (C) the Third Party Claim has a reasonable likelihood of resulting
in Damages that would exceed the remaining balance of the General Escrow Fund,
or (D) the Third Party Claim involves as a claimant a customer, client or
supplier of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have fifteen (15) days after receipt of a
Third Party Claim Notice (or such shorter period of time as may be
necessitated by the nature of such Third Party Claim and specified in the
Third Party Claim Notice) to notify the Indemnitee if the Indemnifying Party
will assume the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party
has the right to and elects to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (or
the Indemnitee has consented to the Indemnifying Partys assumption of such
defense), (A) the Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ separate
counsel of its choosing at the Indemnitees expense; _provided, however_ ,
that the fees and expenses of separate counsel retained by Parent shall be
paid out of the General Escrow Fund if Parent assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim after the Holder Representative has failed to diligently defend
such Third Party Claim; and _further provided_ that the fees and expenses of
separate counsel retained by Holder Representative shall be paid by Parent (in
the case where Parent is an Indemnifying Party) if Holder Representative
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim after the Parent has failed to
diligently defend such Third Party Claim; and (B) the Indemnifying Party shall
(w) conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim with reasonable diligence
and keep the Indemnitee reasonably informed of material developments in the
Third Party Claim at all stages thereof, (x) promptly submit to the Indemnitee
copies of all pleadings, responsive pleadings, motions and other similar legal
documents and papers received or filed in connection therewith, (y) permit the
Indemnitee and its counsel to confer on the conduct of the defense thereof and
(z) permit the Indemnitee and its counsel an opportunity to review all legal
papers to be submitted prior to their submission. In the

 



      
 

 



 

case where the Holder Representative is not entitled to assume the defense of
a Third Party Claim, the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Parent
shall be paid out of the General Escrow Fund.

 



 

(iii) Any compromise, settlement or offer of settlement of any Third Party
Claim by the Holder Representative shall require the prior written consent of
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Any compromise, settlement or offer of settlement of any Third Party
Claim by Parent or any of its Affiliates shall require the prior written
consent of the Holder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(iv) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnitee within fifteen
(15) days after receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice of its assumption of
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim with the expenses of such defense to be paid out of
the General Escrow Fund, _provided, however_ , that the Indemnitee may
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim (with the same rights of
Indemnifying Party as are set forth in clause (ii)(B) above) with its own
counsel at the expense of the Indemnitee.

 



 

(c) _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_.

 



 

(i) If the Holder Representative shall object in writing to any claim or
claims for indemnification made in any Indemnification Notice within fifteen
(15) days after delivery of such Indemnification Notice, then the Holder
Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights
of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Holder
Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties.

 



 

(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation within
sixty (60) days after delivery of an Indemnification Notice, either Parent or
the Holder Representative may demand arbitration of the matter in accordance
with the following provisions of this _Section 8.5_ unless the amount of the
Loss is at issue in pending litigation or arbitration with a third party, in
which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is
ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration. If such dispute is subject
to arbitration, it shall be settled by arbitration conducted in accordance
with the rules and procedures then in effect of the American Arbitration
Association by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and the Holder
Representative. In the event that, within thirty (30) days after submission of
any dispute to arbitration, Parent and the Holder Representative cannot
mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen (15) days after the end
of such thirty (30) day period, Parent and the Holder Representative shall
each select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a
third arbitrator. If one party but not the other fails to select an arbitrator
during this fifteen (15) day period, then the parties agree that the
arbitration will be conducted by the one arbitrator selected by the party
which has made such a selection.

 



 

(iii) Any such arbitration shall be held in Phoenix, Arizona. The arbitrator
shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration shall be paid,
including the respective expenses of each party, the fees of each arbitrator
and the administrative fee of the American

 



       
 

 



 

Arbitration Association. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be,
shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce
the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity,
adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant information from the
opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a
majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions
to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions,
including attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court
of law or equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought without
substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without
substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the
three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount of any
claim for indemnification made in an Indemnification Notice shall be final,
binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. Such decision
shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and
conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded
by the arbitrator(s). Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s)
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

 



 

(iv) The foregoing arbitration provision shall apply to any dispute between
the Holder Representative and a Parent Indemnified Party under this _Article
VIII_

 



 

Section 8.6. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payment made
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration for federal, state, local and foreign income tax purposes
unless a contrary treatment is required under applicable Law.

 



 

 _ARTICLE IX_ 
_Miscellaneous_

 



 

Section 9.1. _Holder Representative_.

 



 

(a) _Holder Representative Reserve Amount_. As contemplated by _Article II_
hereof, on the Closing Date, the Holder Representative Reserve Amount shall be
withheld from the amounts otherwise payable hereunder by Parent to the Company
Holders on the Closing Date, and shall be paid by Parent directly to an
account maintained by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement (the " **Holder Representative Reserve Fund** "), as a fund for the
fees and expenses of the Holder Representative incurred in connection with
this Agreement. Any balance of the Holder Representative Reserve Fund not used
for the foregoing purpose shall be released on the Release Date to the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the Company Holders in accordance with
_Section 2.4(b)_ hereof and the Escrow Agreement (any such release, the "
**Holder Representative Reserve Payment** ").

 



 

(b) The Holder Representative shall, for each Represented Holder, have the
right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, and take all actions required or permitted under the Escrow
Agreement and this Agreement with respect to the interests and rights of such
Represented Holder with respect to any claims (including the settlement
thereof) made by a Parent Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to _Article
XIII_ (including the exercise of the power to (i) authorize the delivery of
cash from the Escrow

 



      
 

 



 

Account to Parent or to a Parent Indemnitee in satisfaction of claims by a
Parent Indemnitee, (ii) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and

documents that the Holder Representative deems necessary or appropriate in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions, (v) execute and deliver
all amendments and waivers to this Agreement that the Holder Representative
deems necessary or appropriate, whether prior to, at or after the Closing and
(vi) interpret the terms and provisions of this Agreement and all documents to
be executed and delivered in connection herewith on behalf of the Represented
Holders). In all matters relating to indemnification pursuant to _Article
XIII_, the Holder Representative shall be the only party entitled to assert
