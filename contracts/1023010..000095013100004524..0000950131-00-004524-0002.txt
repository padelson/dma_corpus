AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER  ----------------------------    AGREEMENT
AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 26, 2000 (this "Agreement"), by and
among Fortress Registered Investment Trust, a Delaware business trust
("Parent"), Fortress Brookdale Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company ("Purchaser"), owned by Parent, Health Partners, a Bermuda exempted
partnership ("Health Partners") and certain of their respective affiliates,
FBZ Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Purchaser ("Acquisition Sub") and Brookdale Living Communities, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").   WHEREAS, the managements of Parent
and Purchaser and the Committee of Independent Directors, consisting entirely
of nonmanagement directors (the "Independent Committee"), of the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Board") have determined that it is advisable
and in the best interests of their respective stockholders and members, as
the case may be, for Purchaser to acquire the Company upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;   WHEREAS, in furtherance of
such acquisition, Purchaser has agreed to commence a tender offer (the
"Offer") to purchase for cash all of the issued and outstanding shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") not already owned by Purchaser or Parent (collectively, the
"Shares"), at a price of $15.25 per share, net to the seller in cash
(such price, or such higher price per share as may be paid in the Offer,
being referred to herein as the "Offer Price"), less any amounts required by
law to be withheld and paid to governmental entities, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement;   WHEREAS, the Board, acting
upon the unanimous recommendation of the Independent Committee, and the
respective managements of Parent and Purchaser, have each approved the making
of the Offer, and the Board has determined to recommend that stockholders of
the Company (other than Parent, Purchaser and their respective affiliates)
(the "Stockholders") tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer;   WHEREAS,
Purchaser is the owner of 4,004,350 shares of Company Common Stock, and
Parent and Health Partners have agreed to contribute cash and the Convertible
Note (as hereinafter defined) respectively to Purchaser in order
to   facilitate the making of the Offer and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;   WHEREAS, it is further proposed that
following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser will cause Acquisition Sub
to merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the "DGCL");
and   WHEREAS, the Independent Committee has determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the Stockholders, and
the Board, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Independent
Committee, (i) has approved the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) recommends that the
Stockholders approve this Agreement and adopt the Merger;   NOW, THEREFORE,
in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto agree as follows:    ARTICLE I   THE OFFER AND
MERGER   Section 1.1 The Offer. (a) As promptly as practicable (but in
no event prior to Tuesday, August 1, 2000) Purchaser shall commence (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act")), the Offer to purchase for cash any and all of
the Shares at the Offer Price. Purchaser shall, on the terms and subject to
the prior satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Offer, accept for
payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer as soon as it is legally permitted to do so under applicable law.
The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to
Purchase") containing the terms set forth in this Agreement and the other
conditions set forth in Annex A hereto. Purchaser shall not decrease the
Offer Price or decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer, change the
form of consideration to be paid for Shares pursuant to the Offer, or amend
or add any other term or condition of the Offer (including the conditions
set   2   forth in Annex A hereto), in each case, in any manner adverse
to the holders of the Shares without the prior written consent of the
Company. The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twenty-fifth
(25th) business day following the date that the Offer is commenced within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act (the "Initial Expiration Date").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall, and Parent agrees to cause
Purchaser to, extend the Expiration Date of the Offer from time to time until
60 days from execution of this Agreement if, and to the extent that, at the
Initial Expiration Date of the Offer, or any extension thereof, all
conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived. In addition, the
Offer Price may be increased and the Offer may be extended to the extent
required by law in connection with such increase in each case without the
consent of the Company. If, immediately prior to the expiration date of the
Offer (as it then may be extended), the Shares tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer, together with the Shares then owned by Purchaser,
constitute less than 90% of the outstanding Shares, Purchaser may extend the
Offer for a period not to exceed ten business days, notwithstanding that all
conditions to the Offer are satisfied as of such expiration date of
the Offer.   (b) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced,
Parent and Purchaser shall file with the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto
and including the exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO"). The Schedule TO will
include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of
transmittal, summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents
(collectively, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the
"Offer Documents"). The Offer Documents will comply in all material respects
with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws. Each of Parent and
Purchaser further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Each of Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, agrees promptly to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it
shall have become false and misleading in any material respect and Purchaser
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company and its outside counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review the initial Schedule TO (and any
amendments thereto) before it is filed with the SEC. In addition, Parent and
Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel in writing with any
comments or other communications,   3   whether written or oral, that
Parent, Purchaser or their outside counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the
receipt of such comments or other communications.   Section 1.2 Company
Actions. (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and
represents and warrants that the Independent Committee has determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer
and the Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the Stockholders,
and the Board, at a meeting duly called and held and acting on the unanimous
recommendation of the Independent Committee, has (i) duly approved the
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, (ii) resolved to recommend that
the Stockholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares thereunder and approve
this Agreement and the Merger; provided, however, that such recommendation
may be withdrawn or modified in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement and (iii) approved the transfer of the Convertible Note from Health
Partners to Purchaser; provided, however, that such approval is conditioned
upon Purchaser actually purchasing Shares pursuant to the Offer.   (b)
Concurrently with the commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with
the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together
with all amendments and supplements thereto and including the
exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") which shall, subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, contain the recommendation referred to in
clause (ii) of Section 1.2(a) hereof. The Schedule 14D-9 will comply in all
material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws.
The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the
other hand, agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use
in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false
and misleading in any material respect and the Company further agrees to take
all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Purchaser
and its outside counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the
initial Schedule 14D-9 (and any amendment thereto) before it is filed with
the SEC. In addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent, Purchaser and
their outside counsel in writing with any comments or other communications,
whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel   4   may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments or
other communications.   (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company will
promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Purchaser mailing labels,
security position listings and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of
a recent date, and shall furnish Purchaser with such additional information
(including updated lists of holders of Shares and their addresses, mailing
labels and lists of security positions) and such other assistance as
Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to
the record and beneficial stockholders of the Company. Except for such steps
as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents, Parent and Purchaser
shall hold in confidence the information contained in any of such labels and
lists and the additional information referred to in the preceding sentence,
will use such information only in connection with the Offer, and, if this
Agreement is terminated, will promptly upon request of the Company destroy or
cause to be destroyed (or deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company, if
the Company so requests) all copies of such information then in its
possession or the possession of its agents or representatives.   Section
1.3 Directors. (a) Promptly upon the purchase of and payment for Shares by
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer which, when taken together with the shares of
Company Common Stock otherwise owned by Purchaser, represent at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Purchaser shall
be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the
next whole number, on the Board equal to the product of the total number of
directors on the Board (giving effect to the directors designated by
Purchaser pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by
Purchaser bears to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding minus four (4) (to give effect to the four seats on the Board
presently occupied by Wesley R. Edens, William B. Doniger, Paul H. Warren and
Mark H. Tabak). The Company shall, upon request of Purchaser, use its
reasonable best efforts promptly either to increase the size of the Board
(which, pursuant to the Company\'s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, has
a maximum number of 11 directors) or, at the Company\'s election, secure the
resignations of such number of its incumbent directors, or both, as is
necessary to enable Purchaser\'s designees to be so elected to the Board, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Purchaser\'s designees to be
so elected.   5    (b) The Company\'s obligations under Section 1.3(a)
shall be subject in all instances to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all
actions required pursuant to such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to
fulfill its obligations under Section 1.3(a), including mailing to
shareholders the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as
is necessary to enable Purchaser\'s designees to be elected to the Board, and
the Company agrees to make such mailing with the mailing of Schedule 14D-9 so
long as Parent or Purchaser shall have provided to the Company on a timely
basis the information referred to in the next sentence. Parent or Purchaser
will promptly supply the Company, in writing, any information with respect to
either of them and their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f- 1. In the event that
Purchaser\'s designees are elected to the Board prior to the Effective Time
(as defined in Section 1.5 hereof) and notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 1.3(a), until the Effective Time, the Company shall retain as members
of the Board at least three (3) directors who are directors of the Company on
the date hereof (the "Company Designees"); provided that, in such event, if
the number of Company Designees shall be reduced below three (3) for any
reason whatsoever, any remaining Company Designees (or Company Designee,
if there be only one remaining) shall be entitled to designate persons to
fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be Company Designees for purposes
of this Agreement or, if no Company Designee then remains, the other
directors shall designate three (3) persons to fill such vacancies who shall
not be stockholders, affiliates or associates of Parent or Purchaser, and
such persons shall be deemed to be Company Designees for purposes of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event that Purchaser\'s designees are elected to the Board prior to the
Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Company Designees
shall be required for the Company to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement or
agree or consent to any amendment or termination of this Agreement, (ii)
exercise or waive any of the Company\'s rights, benefits or remedies
hereunder, (iii) extend the time for performance of Parent\'s and
Purchaser\'s respective obligations hereunder or (iv) take any other action
by the Board under or in connection with this Agreement other than the
actions provided for in Section 1.9 hereof which shall not require the
approval of the Company Designees. The initial Company Designees shall be
Wayne D. Boberg, Dr. Bruce L. Gewertz and Darryl W. Hartley-Leonard.  
Section 1.4 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.5 hereof),
the Company, Purchaser and Acquisition Sub shall consummate the Merger
pursuant to which (a) Acquisition Sub or a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Acquisition Sub shall be merged   6   with and into the Company and the
separate corporate existence of Acquisition Sub shall thereupon cease, (b)
the Company shall be the successor or surviving corporation in the Merger
(the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the laws
of the State of Delaware, and (c) the separate existence of the Company with
all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue
unaffected by the Merger. Acquisition Sub may assign its rights under this
Agreement to a wholly owned subsidiary of Acquisition Sub which assumes all
applicable obligations of Acquisition Sub hereunder. Pursuant to the Merger,
(x) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by law and such Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and (y) the
Amended and Restated By-laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the Amended and Restated By-laws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and such Amended and Restated By-Laws.
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL.   Section 1.5
Effective Time. As soon as practicable, on the date of the Closing (as
defined in Section 1.6 hereof), or on such other date as the parties may
agree, Purchaser, Acquisition Sub and the Company will cause a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed and filed with the
Secretary of State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective on the date on which the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such other subsequent
time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the
"Effective Time").   Section 1.6 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on a date to be
specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business
day after satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of all of the
conditions set forth in Article VI hereof (the "Closing Date"), at the
offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New
York, New York, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto.   Section 1.7 Directors and Officers of the Surviving
Corporation. The directors of Acquisition Sub at the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed
or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or   7   removal
in accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s Restated Certificate
of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws. The officers of the
Company at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have
been duly elected or appointed or qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws.  
Section 1.8 Subsequent Actions. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation will consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Acquisition Sub
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or
Purchaser, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance,
assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
the Company, Purchaser or Acquisition Sub or otherwise, all such other
actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.   Section 1.9 Stockholders\' Meeting; Short-Form Merger. (a)
If required by applicable law in order to consummate the Merger, the
Company, acting through its Board, shall, in accordance with its Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws and applicable
law:   (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting 
of its stockholders (the "Special Meeting") as soon as practicable  following
the acceptance for payment and purchase of Shares by Purchaser  pursuant to
the Offer for the purpose of considering and taking action upon  the approval
of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement;   (ii) prepare and file
with the SEC a preliminary proxy or  information statement relating to the
Merger and this Agreement and use its  reasonable best efforts to obtain and
furnish the information required to  be included by the SEC in the Proxy
Statement (as hereinafter defined) and,  after   8    consultation with
Purchaser, to respond promptly to any comments made by  the SEC with respect
to the preliminary proxy or information statement and  cause a definitive
proxy or information statement (the "Proxy Statement")  to be mailed to its
stockholders;   (iii) include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of
the  Board that stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval of
the  Merger and the adoption of this Agreement; and   (iv) use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from holders of  Shares proxies in favor
of the Merger and take all other action necessary  or advisable to secure any
vote or consent of stockholders required by the  DGCL to effect the
Merger.   (b) Purchaser agrees that it will promptly provide the Company,
in writing, with the information concerning Parent and Purchaser required to
be included in the Proxy Statement and will vote at the Special Meeting, or
cause to be voted at the Special Meeting, all of the shares of Company Common
Stock then owned by it, Purchaser or any of its other subsidiaries and
affiliates in favor of the approval of the Merger and the adoption of this
Agreement.   (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.9(a) and (b)
hereof, in the event that Parent, Purchaser and any other subsidiary of
Parent (or any of them) shall collectively acquire at least 90% of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or otherwise
(including shares of Company Common Stock currently owned by Purchaser and
its affiliates), the parties hereto agree to take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective promptly after the
acceptance for payment of and payment for Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the
Offer without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with
Section 253 of the DGCL.   ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES  
Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any shares
of Company Common Stock or shares of Acquisition Sub (the "Acquisition Sub
Common Stock"):   9    (a) Acquisition Sub Common Stock. Each issued and
outstanding share of Acquisition Sub Common Stock (or if Acquisition Sub has
assigned its rights hereunder to a wholly owned subsidiary, each issued and
outstanding share of such subsidiary) shall automatically be converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned
Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock owned by the Company as treasury
stock and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Purchaser, Acquisition
Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser (other than shares in
trust accounts, managed accounts, custodial accounts and the like that are
beneficially owned by third parties) shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.   (c) Conversion of Shares. Each issued and outstanding
Share (other than any Dissenting Shares (if applicable and as defined in
Section 2.3 hereof)) shall automatically be converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price, payable to the holder thereof, without interest (the
"Merger Consideration"), less any amounts required by law to be withheld and
paid to governmental entities, upon surrender of the certificate formerly
representing such Share in the manner provided in Section 2.2 hereof. All
such Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance
with Section 2.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time the Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares, and such action is in compliance with
Section 5.1 hereof, the Merger Consideration will be correspondingly adjusted
on a per-share basis to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of
shares.   Section 2.2 Surrender of Certificates. (a) Paying Agent.
Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as agent for the holders of Shares in connection with the
Merger (the "Paying Agent") to receive the funds to which holders of Shares
shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) hereof. Prior to the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit or   10   cause to be deposited
with the Paying Agent such aggregate funds for timely payment of the
consideration to which such holders shall be entitled hereunder. Such funds
shall be invested as directed by Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation
pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to holders of the Shares.
Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings
shall accrue to the benefit of holders of the Shares. If the amount of funds
deposited with the Paying Agent by or on behalf of Purchaser is insufficient
to pay all of the amounts required to be paid pursuant to Sections 2.1(c) and
2.3(b) hereof, Purchaser from time to time after the Effective Time shall
take all steps necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to
legally deposit in trust additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to
make all required cash payments.   (b) Surrender Procedures. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time but in no event more than
three business days thereafter, Purchaser shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates, which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the
"Certificates"), whose Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions not inconsistent with this Agreement as Purchaser and the
Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Purchaser, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be  
11   deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this
Section 2.2.   (c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the
Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.   (d) Termination of Fund; No
Liability. At any time following 180 days after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) which had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall
be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.   (e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct or
otherwise indemnify the Surviving Corporation in a manner satisfactory to it
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen, or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Agreement.   Section 2.3 Dissenting Shares. (a) Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any Shares as to which the
holder thereof has demanded appraisal with respect to the Merger in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and as of the Effective Time has
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost his   12   right to such
appraisal ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a
right to receive cash pursuant to Section 2.1, but the holder thereof shall
be entitled to only such rights as are granted by the DGCL.   (b)
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.3(a), if any holder of Shares who
demands appraisal of his Shares under the DGCL effectively withdraws or loses
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to appraisal, then as of
the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs,
such holder\'s Shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.1(c), without interest, upon surrender of the Certificate or
Certificates representing such Shares pursuant to Section 2.2.   (c) The
Company shall give Purchaser (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal or payment of the fair value of any Shares, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served on the Company pursuant to the DGCL
received by the Company in connection therewith and (ii) the opportunity
to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. Except with the prior written consent of Purchaser,
the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, settle or offer to settle any such demands.  
Section 2.4 Option Plans; Warrants. (a) The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause, at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
then outstanding stock option (each, an "Option") granted to
certain employees and directors of the Company under the Brookdale Living
Communities, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan, 1998 Brookdale Living Communities,
Inc. Stock Incentive Plan and 1999 Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended (collectively, the "Option Plans"), whether or not
then vested or exercisable, to be cancelled. In consideration of such
cancellation of Options with an exercise price of less than the Offer Price,
the Company (or, at Parent\'s option, Purchaser), at or immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall pay to such holders of Options an amount in respect
thereof equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price
over the exercise price of such Options and (B) the number of Shares subject
to such vested or unvested Options immediately prior to their cancellation
(such payment to be net of withholding taxes, if any, and without
interest).   (b) The Board or any committee thereof responsible for
the administration of the Option Plans shall take all actions necessary so
that all such   13   Option Plans and Options with strike prices higher
than the Offer Price shall terminate as of the Effective Time.   (c) The
Company shall cause, at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Warrants (as hereinafter defined) to be cancelled for no consideration (it
being understood that such cancellation is not a condition to the
acceptance for payment of Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer).  
ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as
set forth in the SEC Documents (as defined in Section 3.7) or otherwise
disclosed to Parent and Purchaser in a schedule delivered to them at or prior
to the execution hereof (the "Disclosure Schedule"), the Company represents
and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows:   Section 3.1 Organization.
Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is a corporation (or, if not a
corporation, duly organized), validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation (or, if not a corporation,
organization) and has all requisite power (or, if a corporation, corporate
power), and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be
so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power and
authority would not have any material adverse effect upon the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have any material
adverse effect upon the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The
Company has heretofore delivered to Parent a complete and correct copy
of each of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated
By- Laws, as currently in effect, and has heretofore made available to Parent
a complete and correct copy of the equivalent organizational documents of
each of its subsidiaries, as currently in effect.   Section 3.2
Capitalization. (a) As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of
the Company consists of 75,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and
20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"Preferred Stock"). As of the close of business on July 25, 2000,
(i) 9,926,549 shares of   14   Company Common Stock were issued and
outstanding, (ii) 5,479,452 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for

issued under the Indenture dated May 14, 1999 (collectively, the "Convertible
Note"), (iii) 771,384 shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to the
Option Plans were reserved for issuance in connection with Options, (iv)
1,724,800 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and held in the treasury
of the Company, (v) 107,256 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for
issuance pursuant to warrants held by Banc One Capital Partners IV, Ltd., and
10,000 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to
warrants held by Banc One Capital Markets, Inc. (collectively, the
"Warrants"), and (vi) there were no shares of Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding. All the outstanding shares of the Company\'s capital stock are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free of
preemptive rights. Except for the Convertible Notes, Options and Warrants and
the Stockholders Agreement, as amended to date, by and among the Company,
Purchaser and Health Partners, as of the date hereof, there are no existing
(i) options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or other rights, convertible
securities, agreements or commitments of any character obligating the Company
or any of its subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital
stock or other equity interest in, the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity
interests, (ii) contractual obligations of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (iii) voting trusts or similar
agreements to which the Company is a party with respect to the voting of the
capital stock of the Company.   (b) All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock (or equivalent equity interests of entities other than
corporations) of each of the Company\'s subsidiaries are owned of record and
beneficially, directly or indirectly, by the Company.   Section 3.3
Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Company Action. The Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and, subject to obtaining the approval of its stockholders, to the extent
necessary, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement, and the
consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly
authorized by the Board and, except for obtaining the approval of its
stockholders as contemplated by Section 1.9 hereof, to the extent necessary,
no other corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement
has been duly executed and   15   delivered by the Company and (assuming
due and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent and
Purchaser) is a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such
enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting creditors\' rights generally, and (ii) equitable remedies from
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief
may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.   Section 3.4 State
Takeover Statutes. In addition to the Company\'s representations and
warranties contained in Section 1.2(a), the action taken by the Board
constitutes approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby or entered into in connection herewith by the Board under the
provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL such that Section 203 of the DGCL
does not apply to this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated
hereby (together with any similar approval made by the Board pursuant to the
Section 203 of the DGCL with respect to any affiliate or subsidiary of Parent
or Purchaser, collectively the "Section 203 Approval"). No other state
takeover statute is applicable to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.   Section 3.5 Vote Required. In the event that Section
253 of the DGCL is inapplicable and unavailable to effectuate the Merger, the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (voting as one class, with each share of
Company Common Stock having one (1) vote) entitled to be cast is the only
vote of the holders of any class or series of the Company\'s capital stock
necessary to approve the Merger.   Section 3.6 Consents and Approvals; No
Violations. Except for the filings, permits, authorizations, consents and
approvals as may be required under, and other applicable requirements of, the
Exchange Act, the Hart-Scott- Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the "HSR Act"), state securities or blue sky laws and DGCL, matters
specifically described in this Agreement and matters described in the
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (i) violate any provision of the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated By-Laws of the
Company or equivalent organizational documents of any of its subsidiaries,
(ii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due
notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration) under,   16   any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
lease, license, contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which any
of them or any of their properties or assets may be bound and which has been
filed as an exhibit to the SEC Documents (the "Material Agreements"), (iii)
violate any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or
regulation applicable to the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of their
properties or assets, or (iv) require on the part of the Company any filing
or registration with, notification to, or authorization, consent or approval
of, any court, legislative, executive or regulatory authority or agency (a
"Governmental Entity"); except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) for
such violations, breaches or defaults which, or filings, registrations,
notifications, authorizations, consents or approvals the failure of which to
obtain, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and would not materially adversely affect the
ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   Section 3.7 SEC Reports and Financial Statements. The Company
has filed all reports required to be filed by it with the SEC pursuant to
the Exchange Act and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), since January 1, 1999 (as such documents have been amended since the
date of their filing, collectively, the "SEC Documents"). The SEC Documents,
as of their respective filing dates, or if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment, (a) did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (b) complied in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder. Each of the consolidated balance sheets
(including the related notes) included in the SEC Documents presents in all
material respects the financial position of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof, and the other related
statements (including the related notes) included in the SEC Documents
present in all material respects the results of operations and cash flows of
the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the respective periods or
as of the respective dates set forth therein. Each of the consolidated
balance sheets and statements of operations and cash flows (including the
related notes) included in the SEC Documents has been prepared in all
material respects in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved, except as otherwise noted therein and subject, in the
case of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year-end
adjustments.   17    Section 3.8 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except (a)
as disclosed in the Company\'s consolidated financial statements included in
the SEC Documents and (b) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice since March 31,
2000, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
that have, or would be reasonably likely to have, a material adverse effect
on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.   Section 3.9
Absence of Certain Changes. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, since
March 31, 2000, the business of the Company and each of its subsidiaries has
been conducted in the ordinary and usual course consistent with past practice
and the Company has not (i) suffered any change having or reasonably likely
to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole; (ii) amended its Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended
and Restated By-laws; (iii) taken any action which would have been prohibited
under Section 5.1 if such section applied to the period between March 31,
2000 and the date of execution of this Agreement; (iv) declared or set aside
or paid any dividend or other distribution with respect to the Company Common
Stock; or (v) materially changed the Company\'s accounting methods.  
Section 3.10 Litigation. There is no action, suit, inquiry, proceeding or
investigation by or before any court or governmental or other regulatory or
administrative agency or commission pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge,
threatened against or involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
which questions or challenges the validity of this Agreement, other than
those (i) disclosed in the SEC Documents or (ii) the outcome of which would
not (A) have, or reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on
the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) reasonably
be expected to materially impair or delay the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.   Section 3.11 Employee
Benefit Plans; ERISA. (a) The Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of each deferred compensation and each incentive compensation,
stock purchase, stock option and other equity compensation plan, program,
agreement or arrangement; each severance or termination pay, medical,
surgical, hospitalization, life insurance and other "welfare" plan, fund or
program (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")); each profit- sharing, stock
bonus or other "pension" plan, fund or program (within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA); each employment, termination or severance agreement; and each
other employee benefit plan,   18   fund, program, agreement or
arrangement (such a plan, program, agreement, arrangement or program, a
"Plan"; collectively "Plans"), in each case, that is sponsored, maintained or
contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company or by any
trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that together with the
Company would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section
4001(b) of ERISA ("ERISA Affiliate"), or to which the Company or an ERISA
Affiliate is party, whether written or oral, for the benefit of any employee
or former employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Neither the
Company, any of its subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has any
commitment or formal plan, whether legally binding or not, to create any
additional employee benefit plan or modify or change any existing plan that
would affect any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries.   (b) The Company has heretofore delivered or made available
to Parent true and complete copies of each Plan and any amendments thereto
(or if a Plan is not a written Plan, a description thereof), any related
trust or other funding vehicle, any summaries required under ERISA or the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Code"), the most recent annual reports filed,
and the most recent determination letter received from the United States
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to each Plan intended to
qualify under Section 401 of the Code.   (c) No Plan is subject to Title IV
or Section 302 of ERISA.   (d) To the Company\'s knowledge, neither the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, any Plan, any trust created thereunder,
nor any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction in
connection with which the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any Plan, any
such trust, or any trustee or administrator thereof, or any party dealing
with any Plan or any such trust could reasonably be subject to either a civil
penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed
pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.   (e) Each Plan has been
operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and applicable law, including but not limited to ERISA and the
Code.   (f) Each Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified, and the trusts maintained
thereunder are exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code. Each
Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) has satisfied
such requirements.   19    (g) No Plan provides medical, surgical,
hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for
employees or former employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for
periods extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service,
other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law, (ii) death benefits under
any "pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the
current or former employee (or his beneficiary).   (h) No amounts payable
under the Plans will fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by
virtue of Section 280G of the Code.   (i) The consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, either alone or in combination
with another event, (i) entitle any current or former employee or officer of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount of, compensation due any such employee or officer.   (j) There are
no pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened or anticipated claims
by or on behalf of any Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any
such Plan, or otherwise involving any such Plan (other than routine claims
for benefits).   Section 3.12 No Default; Compliance with Applicable Laws.
The business of the Company and each of its subsidiaries is not in default
(with or without due notice or the passage of time or both) or violation of,
any term, condition or provision of (i) their respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws or similar organizational documents, (ii) any
Material Agreement or (iii) any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment,
decree, order, arbitration award, concession, grant, franchise, permit or
license or other governmental authorization or approval applicable to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, excluding from the foregoing clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii), defaults or violations which would not have a material
adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.  
Section 3.13 Taxes. (a) The Company and each of its subsidiaries have duly
filed all Tax Returns (as defined in Section 3.13 (i) below) that
are required to be filed excluding only such Tax Returns as to which any
failure to file does not have a material adverse effect on the Company and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and have duly paid or caused to be duly
paid in full or made provision in accordance with GAAP (or there has been
paid or provision has been made on their behalf) for the payment of all
material Taxes (also as defined in Section 3.13 (i)   20   below) for
all periods or portions thereof ending through the date hereof. All such Tax
Returns are correct and complete in all material respects and accurately
reflect all liability for material Taxes for the periods covered thereby. All
material Taxes owed and due by the Company and all of its subsidiaries
relating to operations on or prior to March 31, 2000 (whether or not shown on
any Tax Return) have been paid or have been adequately reflected on the
Company\'s consolidated financial statements included in the SEC
Documents. Since March 31, 2000, the Company has not incurred liability for
any material Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business. Neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received written notice of any claim
made by an authority in a jurisdiction where neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries file Tax Returns, that the Company is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction.   (b) Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations in any jurisdiction in
respect of material Taxes or material Tax Returns or agreed to any extension
of time with respect to a material Tax assessment or deficiency.   (c) No
federal, state, local or foreign audits, examinations or other administrative
proceedings have been commenced or, to the Company\'s knowledge, are pending
with regard to any material Taxes or material Tax Returns of the Company or
of any of its subsidiaries. No written notification has been received by the
Company or by any of its subsidiaries that such an audit, examination or
other proceeding is pending or threatened with respect to any material Taxes
due from or with respect to or attributable to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any material Tax Return filed by or with respect to
the Company or any of its subsidiaries. To the Company\'s knowledge, there is
no dispute or claim concerning any material Tax liability of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries either claimed or raised by any taxing authority in
writing.   (d) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to
any agreement, plan, contract or arrangement that could result, separately or
in the aggregate, in a payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code.   (e) Neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries has filed a consent pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code
(or any predecessor provision) concerning collapsible corporations, or agreed
to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to any disposition of a
"subsection (f) asset" (as such term is defined in Section 341(f)(4) of the
Code) owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.   21    (f) No
taxing authority has asserted in writing a claim against the Company or any
of its subsidiaries under or as a result of Section 482 of the Code or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law.   (g) None of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries has been a member of any affiliated group within
the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code, or any similar affiliated or
consolidated group for tax purposes under state, local or foreign law (other
than a group the common parent of which is the Company), or has any liability
for Taxes of any person (other than the Company and its subsidiaries) under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign law as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any material
tax sharing, tax indemnity or other agreement or arrangement with any entity
not included in the Company\'s consolidated financial statements included in
the SEC Documents.   (h) There are no material liens for Taxes upon the
assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries which are not provided for
in the Company\'s consolidated financial statements included in the SEC
Documents, except liens for Taxes not yet due and payable.   (i) For
purposes of this Agreement, "Taxes" shall mean any and all taxes, charges,
fees, levies or other assessments, including, without limitation, income,
gross receipts, excise, real or personal property, sales, withholding, social
security, occupation, use, service, service use, value added, license, net
worth, payroll, franchise, transfer and recording taxes, fees and charges,
imposed by the IRS or any taxing authority (whether domestic or foreign
including, without limitation, any state, local or foreign government or any
subdivision or taxing agency thereof (including a United States possession)),
whether computed on a separate, consolidated, unitary, combined or any other
basis; and such term shall include any interest, penalties or additional
amounts attributable to, or imposed upon, or with respect to, any such taxes,
charges, fees, levies or other assessments. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Tax Return" shall mean any report, return, document, declaration or other
information or filing required to be supplied to any taxing authority
or jurisdiction (foreign or domestic) with respect to Taxes.   Section 3.14
Title to Properties; Encumbrances. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries
has fee simple title to all of the real properties which it purports to own.
All such real properties are not subject to any mortgages, title defects or
objections, liens, claims, charges, security interests or other encumbrances
("En-   22   cumbrances"), which would cause a material adverse effect on
the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and are not subject to
any rights of way, building use restrictions, exceptions, variances,
reservations or limitations ("Property Restrictions"), which would cause a
material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, except (i) Property Restrictions imposed or promulgated by law or any
governmental body or authority with respect to real property, including
zoning regulations, which would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) Encumbrances and
Property Restrictions disclosed on existing title reports, existing title
policies or existing surveys (in any case copies of which title reports,

whole.   Section 3.15 No Condemnation or Expropriation. Neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries has received written notice to the effect that
the whole or any material portion of the real properties owned or leased by

the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company has not
received written notice under any of such leases of any default, and, to the
Company\'s knowledge, no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute such a default by the Company or its

or circumstances that could form the basis of any Environmental Claim against
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or against any person or entity

law, except where such Environmental Claim, if made, would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. All permits and other governmental authorizations currently held or

recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) cause the Company to enter into
any letter of intent or agreement (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement")
related to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that (A) the Independent Committee determines in good faith, after
receiving advice from its financial advisor, that any such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 5.4(d) below) and (B)
the Independent Committee determines in good faith, based upon advice of its
outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary for the Independent
Committee to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders
under applicable law, the Independent Committee may (x) withdraw or adversely
modify its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer and the
Merger or the matters to be considered at the Special Meeting, (y) approve or
recommend such Superior Proposal and/or (z) terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1(c)(i) and prior to or substantially
contemporaneously with such termination, cause the Company to enter into a
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal.   (c)
For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any bona
fide proposal in writing made by a third party to acquire
"beneficial ownership" (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of
all of the assets of, or equity interest in, the Company or its subsidiaries
pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of
shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer or exchange offer or
similar transaction involving the Company or its material subsidiaries
including, without limitation, any single or multi-step transaction or series
of related transactions which is structured to permit such third party to
acquire beneficial ownership of all or substantially all of the assets of, or
a majority or more of the equity interest in, the Company or its material
subsidiaries (other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement).   (d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means
any bona fide proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, for
consideration   33   consisting of cash and/or securities, more than a
majority of the Shares then outstanding or all or substantially all the
assets of the Company, and otherwise on terms which the Independent Committee
determines in good faith to be more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders,
from a financial point of view, than the Offer and the Merger (based on
advice of the Independent Committee\'s financial advisor that the value of
the consideration provided for in such proposal is superior to the value of
the consideration provided for in the Offer and the Merger), for which
financing, to the extent required, is then committed.   Section 5.5
Publicity. The initial press release with respect to the execution of this
Agreement shall be a joint press release acceptable to Parent and the
Company; provided, that the parties hereto agree that such press
release shall include, among other things, the following statement:  
Fortress Brookdale Acquisition LLC will be paid an  expense reimbursement
payment of $750,000 in the  event that the Independent Committee of the
Company\'s  Board of Directors receives a higher offer from a  third party
and accepts that offer pursuant to the  exercise of its fiduciary duties.
Other than the  expense reimbursement payment, no other "break-up"  or
"commitment" fee would be payable in such event.  Thereafter, so long as
this Agreement is in effect, neither the Company, Parent nor any of their
respective affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior consultation of the other party, except
as may be required by law or by the applicable rules of the NASDAQ National
Market System.   Section 5.6 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to
the Company, of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which would cause any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) any material
failure of the Company, or Parent, Purchaser, or Acquisition Sub, as the case
may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.   34    Section 5.7 Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance and
Indemnification. (a) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation (or any successor to the Surviving Corporation) shall
jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless any person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, an officer, director, employee and agent (the
"Indemnified Party") of the Company and its subsidiaries against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys\'
fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, and amounts incurred in
connection with any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or
investigation (each a "Claim") to the extent that any such Claim is based on,
or arises out of, (i) the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or is or
was serving at the request of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (ii) this Agreement, or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the extent that any
such Claim pertains to any matter or fact arising, existing, or
occurring prior to or at the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under Delaware law, the Company\'s Restated Certificate of Incorporation or
Amended and Restated By-laws or any applicable indemnification agreements in
effect at the date hereof.   (b) Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain the Company\'s existing officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance policy for a period of not less than six years after the Effective
Date; provided, that Parent may substitute therefor policies of substantially
similar coverage and amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such
directors or officers.   (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7. The
provisions of this Section 5.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and
their representatives.   Section 5.8 State Takeover Laws. Notwithstanding
any other provision in this Agreement, in no event shall the Section 203
Approval be withdrawn, revoked or modified by the Board. If any state
takeover statute other than Section 203 of the DGCL becomes or is deemed to
become applicable to the Agreement, the Offer, the acquisition of Shares
pursuant to the Offer or the Merger or any other   35   transaction
provided for or contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall take all
such action as may be necessary or advisable to obtain such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary or advisable so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to minimize
the effects of any such statute on the transactions contemplated hereby.  
Section 5.9 Approvals and Consents; Cooperation. (a) The parties hereto shall

Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws;   (b)
Regulatory Approvals. All regulatory approvals and consents of third parties,
if any, shall have been obtained, except where the failure to have obtained
any such approvals and third party consents would not have a material adverse
effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (it being
understood that if Purchaser has purchased Shares pursuant to the Offer, the
failure to obtain any consent required under the Master Lease (as defined in
the Disclosure Schedule) shall not be deemed to have a material adverse
effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole);   (c)
Statutes; Court Orders. No statute, rule, regulation, order, decree or

Agreement.    ARTICLE VII   TERMINATION   Section 7.1 Termination. This
Agreement may be terminated and the Merger contemplated herein may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
any necessary stockholder approval thereof:   (a) By the mutual written
consent of Purchaser and the Company (acting through the Independent
Committee); or   37    (b) By the Company (acting through the Independent
Committee) or Purchaser:   (i) if the Offer shall have expired in
accordance with the terms  of this Agreement or Purchaser shall have
terminated the Offer, in each  case without any Shares being purchased
pursuant thereto; provided,  however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section  7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any  obligation under this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the  failure of Purchaser to purchase the Shares
pursuant to the Offer on or  promptly after the applicable expiration date;
or   (ii) if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order,  decree or
ruling or taken any other action (which order, decree, ruling or  other
action the parties hereto shall use their respective best efforts to  lift),
which permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits (x) the 
acceptance for payment of, or payment for, Shares pursuant to the Offer or 
(y) the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have 
become final and non-appealable.   (c) By the Company (acting through the
Independent Committee):   (i) if, prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant
to the Offer, a  third party shall have made an Acquisition Proposal that the
Independent  Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial  advisor, is a Superior Proposal and, subject to the Company\'s
compliance  with Section 5.4(b), a Company Acquisition Agreement shall have
been, or  substantially contemporaneously with such termination shall be,
executed  pursuant to such Superior Proposal; or   (ii) if Purchaser shall
have failed to commence the Offer on or  prior to fifteen business days
following the date of the initial public  announcement of the Offer;
provided, that the Company may not terminate  this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(c)(ii) if the cause of such  failure was the Company\'s material
breach of its obligations under this  Agreement; or   (iii) if, prior to
the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer,  Parent, Purchaser or
Acquisition Sub shall have breached or failed to  perform in any material
respect any of their respective representations,  warranties, covenants or
other obligations contained in this Agreement or  if any   38   
representation or warranty of Parent, Purchaser or Acquisition Sub shall 
have become untrue, which breach or failure to perform cannot be or has not 
been cured within ten (10) days after the giving of written notice to 
Purchaser, as applicable, except, in any case, for such breaches, untruths 
or failures to perform which are not, in the Company\'s opinion, reasonably 
likely to adversely affect Purchaser\'s ability to complete the Offer or the 
Merger; provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this  Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(iii) if the Company is then in  material
breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or other  obligations
under this Agreement.   (d) By Purchaser:   (i) if, prior to the purchase
of Shares pursuant to the Offer,  the Independent Committee shall have
withdrawn, modified or changed in a  manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser
its approval or recommendation of the  Offer, this Agreement or the Merger or
shall have recommended an  Acquisition Proposal or the Company (acting
through the Independent  Committee) shall have executed an agreement in
principle or definitive  agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal with a
person or entity other  than Parent, Purchaser or their affiliates (or the
Independent Committee  resolves to do any of the foregoing); or   (ii) if,
due to an occurrence not involving a breach by Parent,  Purchaser or
Acquisition Sub of their respective obligations hereunder,  which makes it
impossible to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in  Annex A hereto,
Purchaser shall have failed to commence the Offer in  accordance with this
Agreement; or   (iii) if, prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the
Offer,  the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its 
representations, warranties, covenants or other obligations contained in 
this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall 
have become untrue (except where the breach or untruth of such 
representations or warranties results from changes specifically permitted  by
this Agreement or from any transaction expressly consented to in writing  by
Parent) which (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set  forth in
paragraph (f) or (g) of Annex A hereto and (B) cannot be or has  not been
cured within ten (10) days after the giving of written notice to  the
Company; provided, however, that Purchaser may not terminate this  Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(iii) if Parent or Purchaser is  then in
material breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or  other
obligations under this Agreement; or   39    (e) By either the Company
(acting through the Independent Committee) or Purchaser if the Merger has not
been consummated on or before December 15, 2000, which date may be extended
by the mutual written consent of the Company and Purchaser.   Section 7.2
Effect of Termination. (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given
to the other party specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void,
and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser, Acquisition
Sub or the Company or their respective directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, representatives, agents or advisors other than, with respect to
Parent, Purchaser, Acquisition Sub and the Company, the obligations pursuant
to this Section 7.2 and Article VIII. Nothing contained in this Section 7.2
shall relieve Parent, Purchaser, Acquisition Sub or the Company
from liability for willful breach of this Agreement.   (b) In the event
that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(i) hereof or by Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) hereof, the
Company shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) business days
following such termination) pay to Purchaser by wire transfer to an account
designated by Purchaser promptly following receipt of a request therefor, an
amount equal to $750,000 for all fees and expenses incurred by Parent and
Purchaser in connection with the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but
not limited to, the fees and expenses payable to Parent\'s counsel, and all
banks, investment banking firms, other financial institutions and their
respective agents and counsel incurred in connection with acting as Parent\'s
or Purchaser\'s financial advisor with respect to, or arranging or committing
to provide or providing any financing for the transactions contemplated
hereby ("Transaction Expenses"); provided, that in no event shall such
Transaction Expenses be payable more than once. In addition, and only in the
event that the Transaction Expenses were not paid or payable pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall pay Purchaser the
Transaction Expenses if this Agreement is terminated for any reason (other
than as a result of a breach by Parent or Purchaser that resulted in the
termination of this Agreement, or a willful breach by Parent or Purchaser of
their obligations hereunder) at any time after an Acquisition Proposal has
been made by a third party (a "Third Party Acquiror") that the Company has
not rejected prior to such termination of this Agreement and, within six (6)
months after such a termination, the Company completes a merger,
consolidation or other business combination with any such Third Party
Acquiror.   40    ARTICLE VIII   MISCELLANEOUS   Section 8.1
Amendment and Modification. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be
amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or
after any vote of the stockholders of the Company contemplated hereby, by
written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective
managements (which in the case of the Company shall include approvals as
contemplated in Section 1.3(b)), at any time prior to the Closing Date
with respect to any of the terms contained herein; provided, however, that
after the approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no
such amendment, modification or supplement shall reduce or change the
Merger Consideration or adversely affect the rights of the Company\'s
stockholders (other than Purchaser or its affiliates) hereunder without the
approval of such stockholders (other than Purchaser or its affiliates).  
Section 8.2 Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties. None of
the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any schedule,
instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall

-------   CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER  -----------------------   The
capitalized terms used in this Annex A shall have the meanings set forth in
the Agreement to which it is annexed, except that the term "Merger Agreement"
shall mean the Agreement to which this Annex A is annexed.   Notwithstanding
any other provision of the Offer, subject to the provisions of the Merger
Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject
to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c)
under the Exchange Act, pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of
or, subject to the restriction referred to above, the payment for, any
tendered Shares, and may, subject to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, terminate the Offer and not accept for payment any tendered Shares
if at any time on or after the date of the Merger Agreement, and before the
time of acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer, any of the
following events shall occur:   (a) there shall be pending any suit, action
or proceeding or there shall be threatened by any Governmental Entity any
suit, action or proceeding (i) seeking to prohibit or impose any material
limitations on Parent\'s or Purchaser\'s ownership or operation (or that of
any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) of all or a material
portion of the business or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or to compel Parent or Purchaser or their respective subsidiaries
and affiliates to dispose of or hold separate any material portion of the
businesses or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates, taken
as a whole, (ii) challenging the acquisition by Parent or Purchaser of any
Shares under the Offer, seeking to restrain or prohibit the making or
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the performance of any of the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or seeking to obtain
from the Company, Parent or Purchaser any damages that are material in
relation to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iii) seeking
to impose material limitations on the ability of Purchaser, or rendering
Purchaser unable, to accept for payment, pay for or purchase some or all of
the Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, (iv) seeking to impose
material limitations on the ability of Purchaser or Parent effectively to
exercise full rights of ownership of the Shares, including, without
limitation, the right to vote the Shares purchased by it on all
matters properly presented to the Company\'s stockholders, or (v) which
otherwise is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;     (b) there shall be
any statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or injunction enacted,
entered, enforced or promulgated applicable to the Offer or the Merger, other
than the application to the Offer or the Merger of applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act, that is reasonably likely to result, directly or
indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in clauses (i) through
(v) of paragraph (a) above;   (c) there shall have occurred (i) any general
suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices for, securities in the
NASDAQ National Market System, for a period in excess of three hours
(excluding suspensions or limitations resulting solely from physical damage
or interference with such exchanges not related to market conditions), (ii) a
declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect
of banks in the United States, (iii) a commencement of a war, armed
hostilities or other international or national calamity directly or
indirectly involving the United States, (iv) any limitation (whether or not
mandatory) by any United States or foreign governmental authority on the
extension of credit by banks or other financial institutions, (v) a change in
general financial bank or capital market conditions which materially or
adversely affects the ability of financial institutions in the United States
to extend credit or syndicate loans, or (vi) in the case of any of the
foregoing existing at the time of the commencement of the Offer, a material
acceleration or worsening thereof;   (d) there shall have occurred any
material adverse change (or any development that, insofar as reasonably can
be foreseen, is reasonably likely to result in any material adverse change)
in the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;   (e) the Board or
the Independent Committee (i) shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner
adverse to Parent or Purchaser its approval or recommendation of the Offer,
this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) shall have recommended the approval or
acceptance of an Acquisition Proposal from, or similar business combination
with, a person or entity other than Parent, Purchaser or any of their
affiliates, or (iii) shall have executed any agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal from, or similar business combination with, a person or
entity other than Parent, Purchaser or their affiliates;   (f) any of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Merger
Agreement that are qualified as to materiality shall not be true and correct
and any such representations and warranties that are not so qualified shall
not be true and correct in any material respect, in each case as of the date
of the Merger Agreement and as of the scheduled expiration of the Offer
(except that those    representations and warranties which address matters
only as of a particular date shall remain true and correct as of such date),
except where the failure to be so true and correct would not reasonably be
expected to (i) have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Offer or (iii) materially increase the cost of the Offer
to Purchaser;   (g) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material
respect or to comply in any material respect with any material obligation,
agreement or covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it
under the Merger Agreement; or   (h) the Merger Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with its terms;  which in the reasonable judgment
of Parent or Purchaser, in any such case, and regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to such condition, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer
and/or with such acceptance for payment of or payment for Shares.   The
foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Parent and,
subject to the Merger Agreement, may be asserted or may be waived by
Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
the sole discretion of Parent or Purchaser. The failure by Parent or
Purchaser at any time to exercise any such rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any right and each right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may
be asserted at any time and from time to time.    '
