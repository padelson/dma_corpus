the event that the Estimated Intercompany Indebtedness  exceeds the

Notification and Consultation. From the date hereof until the Closing Date,
Covance shall cause the Company to provide notice to the Purchaser of the
Company\'s intention to enter into any material Customer Contract (a
"Proposed Transaction"), such notice to be delivered prior to such time as
the Company has entered into a binding agreement with respect to
such Proposed Transaction. After delivery of such notice to the Purchaser,
Covance shall cause the Company to provide the Purchaser with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Proposed Transaction, to consider in
good faith the Purchaser\'s views and opinions with respect to the Proposed
Transaction, including whether the Purchaser considers it advisable for the
Company to consummate the Proposed Transaction, it being understood that the
Company shall retain final authority to decide whether and on what terms to
proceed with the Proposed Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not enter into any Manufacturing Contract without the prior
consent of the Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except with respect to any letter of intent disclosed under Section
4.11 of the Disclosure Schedule.   SECTION 6.03. Access to Information. (a)
From the date hereof until the Closing Date, upon reasonable notice, Covance
shall cause the Company and each of the Company\'s officers, directors,
employees, agents, accountants and counsel, to afford the officers, employees
and authorized agents, accountants, counsel, financing sources and
representatives of the Purchaser reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, to the offices, properties, plants, other
facilities, books and records (including, without limitation, all Customer
Contracts and financial, technical and operating data) of the Company;
provided, however, that such investigation shall not unreasonably interfere
with any of the business or operations of the Company and all such
information provided to the Purchaser shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Purchaser\'s obligations under section 6.04.   (b)
In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by or against the
Company prior to the Closing, for a period of seven years, or such longer
period as may be required by Law, after the Closing, the Purchaser
shall cause the Company to (i) retain the books and records of the Company
relating to periods prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably consistent
with the prior retention practices of the Company, (ii) upon reasonable
notice, afford the officers, employees, authorized agents, accountants,
counsel and representatives of Covance reasonable access (including the right
to make, at such party\'s expense, photocopies), during normal business
hours, to such books and records, (iii) upon reasonable notice, furnish to
the officers, employees, authorized agents, accountants, counsel and
representatives of Covance, such additional financial and other information
regarding the Business relating to periods prior to the Closing as such party
may from time to time reasonably request and (iv) upon reasonable notice, use
reasonable efforts to make available to Covance, the employees of the Company
and any successors whose assistance, testimony or presence is necessary to
assist such party in evaluating any such claims and in defending such claims,
including the presence of such persons as witnesses in hearings or trials for
such purposes; provided, however, that such investigation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company or the
Purchaser, and Covance shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses thereby incurred by the Purchaser, the Company and any such
employee. The Purchaser or the Company shall condition the furnishing of any
information to Covance or any of its representatives or agents pursuant to
this Section 6.03(b) on the execution by Covance of a confidentiality
agreement on customary terms governing the disclosure of such
information.   (c) In connection with their investigation of the business of
the Company, Purchaser has received from the Company certain estimates,
projections and other forecasts for the business of the Company. The
Purchaser acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such estimates, projections and forecasts, that it is familiar with such
uncertainties, that it is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and
forecasts so furnished to it, and that it will not assert any claim against
Covance or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, stockholders, consultants, investment bankers,
accountants or representatives, or hold Covance or any such persons liable
with respect thereto. Accordingly, Covance makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any estimates, projections or forecasts referred to
in this Section 6.03(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Covance represents
and warrants that the amounts set forth as the EBIT Target in Section 2.10 
26   of the Disclosure Schedule and the amounts provided for the Company\'s
budget for the year 2001 in Section 6.01(b)(vii) of the Disclosure Schedule
were prepared in good faith based on reasonable assumptions.   SECTION
6.04. Confidential Disclosure. (a) The terms of the Confidential Disclosure
agreement between Diosynth B.V. and Lehman Brothers, Inc. dated November 16,
2000 (the "Confidential Disclosure Agreement"), are hereby incorporated by
reference, and the parties hereto agree to honor such terms as though they
were a party thereto. The terms of the Confidential Disclosure Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect after the Closing to the extent
provided therein, except (i) in respect of that portion of the Evaluation
Material (as defined in the Confidential Disclosure Agreement) exclusively
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby which shall terminate upon
the Closing, and (ii) in respect of validation protocols, standard operating
procedures, patent applications, batch records, process descriptions and
similar know-how relating to manufacturing and process development disclosed
to the Purchaser, as to which the obligations contained in the Confidential
Disclosure Agreement shall terminate on the earlier of the Closing and the
fifth year anniversary from the date hereof. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidential
Disclosure Agreement shall continue in full force and effect to the extent
provided therein.   (b) Covance shall keep, and shall cause all of its
Agents, to keep confidential, and Covance and its Agents shall not disclose
in any manner, all Purchaser Information and, after the Closing, all Company
Information. Covance and its Agents shall use the Purchaser Information and,
after the Closing, the Company Information solely for the purpose of
fulfilling the obligations and exercising the rights of Covance under this
Agreement. Covance shall not use the Purchaser Information or, after the
Closing, the Company Information, for commercial purposes or to obtain any
competitive advantage with respect to the Purchaser or, after the Closing,
the Company. Covance shall be responsible for any breach of the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.04(b) by any of its Agents. If Covance or any of
its Agents is requested by Law or Governmental Authority to disclose any
Purchaser Information or, after the Closing, any Company Information, Covance
shall provide the Purchaser with prompt notice of any such request or
requirement, so that the Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order
or other appropriate remedy. Covance shall use its reasonable best efforts to
assist the Purchaser and, if applicable, the Company in obtaining a
protective order and to delay disclosure to as late as practicable. If, in
the absence of such a protective order, Covance is nevertheless, in
the opinion of counsel, legally compelled to disclose Purchaser Information
or, after the Closing, Company Information to any Governmental Authority or
else be liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, Covance or
its Agents may disclose such information which in the opinion of counsel is
legally required to be disclosed to such Governmental Authority; provided,
however, that Covance shall give the Purchaser advance written notice of the
information to be disclosed as far in advance as practicable and, at the
Purchaser\'s request, seek to obtain assurances that it will be accorded
confidential treatment. The obligations of Covance under this Section 6.04(b)
shall survive for a period of five years following the earlier to occur of
(i) the Closing and (ii) the termination of this Agreement.   SECTION 6.05.
Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation. (a) For a period of three years after the
Closing (the "Restricted Period"), Covance shall not, and will cause its
subsidiaries not to, engage, directly or indirectly, in any business that
manufactures recombinant proteins for biotechnology and pharmaceutical
clients in preclinical, clinical and commercial scale quantities (the
"Competing Service") in any country in which, as of the Closing Date,
the Company conducts business or has customers (the "Territory"); provided
the foregoing shall not prohibit Covance or its subsidiaries from (i)
continuing to provide any service provided by Covance or its subsidiaries
(not including the Company) as of the Closing Date; (ii) acquiring, directly
or indirectly, securities listed on any national securities exchange or
traded actively in the national over-the-counter market of any Person that
provides the Competing Service in the Territory, provided that Covance and
its Subsidiaries do not, in the aggregate, own directly or indirectly more
than five percent of the outstanding voting power or capital stock of such
Person; and (iii) acquiring a company (the "Diversified Company") or a
business having not more than 10% of its gross revenues in its last fiscal
year attributable to providing the Competing Service. Notwithstanding any of
the foregoing, this Section 6.05 shall not prohibit any Person (or its
Affiliates) that Acquires Covance from providing the Competing Service,
whether by acquisition or otherwise, provided that no such Person (or any
Affiliate of such Person) may provide the Competing Service through Covance
or its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, through the use of any
persons employed by Covance at, or anytime during the six month period
preceding, the time of such acquisition of any assets or
facilities thereof.   (b) For a period of two years after the Closing,
neither Covance nor any of its subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly,
solicit or induce any employee of the Company to leave the employment of such
entity; provided that this covenant shall not be deemed breached if any such
employee is responding to general employment solicitation by Covance or any
of its subsidiaries which is not specifically directed at the employees of
the Company.   SECTION 6.06. Use of Covance\'s Names. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no interest in or right to
use the name "Covance" or any other corporate name of the Company (other than
those listed   27  in Section 6.06 of the Disclosure Schedule) or any
logo, trademark, service mark or trade name or any derivation thereof of
Covance or its Affiliates with respect to, or associated with, the foregoing
or their businesses (collectively, the "Retained Names and Marks") is being
transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and the use of any Retained Names and Marks by the Company and the
Purchaser shall cease as of the Closing. The Purchaser, on or promptly
following the Closing, will, and will cause its Affiliates (including,
without limitation, the Company) to, remove or obliterate all the Retained
Names and Marks from their corporate name (including, without limitation,
appropriate amendments to the corporate charter of the Company), signs,
purchase orders, invoices, sales orders, labels, letterheads,
shipping documents, and other items and materials of the Company and
otherwise, and not to put into use after the Closing any such items and
materials not in existence on the Closing Date that bear any Retained Name or
Mark or any name, mark or logo similar thereto, to another corporate name
that does not include the name "Covance" or any name, mark or logo similar
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser may, for a period of
twelve months following the Closing Date, use the Retained Names and Marks to
identify the Company (or, solely to the extent necessary, with respect to any
application for regulatory approval pending with any Governmental Authority
on the Closing Date, such longer period as may be necessary to secure such
approval without the delay that would otherwise be caused by filing a name
change in connection with such application) so long as such use is made in a
manner intended to indicate that the Company is no longer owned by Covance.
Without limiting the generality of the previous sentence, the Purchaser may
use any purchase orders, invoices, sales orders, labels, letterheads, or
shipping documents existing on the Closing Date that bear any Retained Name
or Mark or any name, mark or logo similar thereto where the removal of any
Retained Name or Mark or any such similar name, mark or logo would be
impractical or difficult until the earlier of the date those purchase orders,
invoices, sales orders, labels, letterheads or supping documents are finished
or six months following the Closing Date; provided, however, that the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including, without
limitation, the Company) to, use commercially reasonable efforts to place a
stamp, mark or other notation on any such item that identifies the Company as
an affiliate or business of the Purchaser (and not of Covance). The Purchaser
agrees that Covance and its Affiliates shall have no responsibility for
claims by third parties arising out of, or relating to, the use after
the Closing by the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof of any Retained Name or
Mark, and the Purchaser shall indemnify Covance and its Affiliates with
respect to any such claims.   SECTION 6.07. Insurance Coverage. As of the
Closing, Covance shall have no obligation to insure the Company or any of the
assets or properties of the Company against any Loss in and under any
insurance policy of Covance or its Affiliates, and the Purchaser shall have
no rights or obligations with respect to any such policy. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Covance shall cooperate with the Purchaser in filing claims and
shall promptly make the proceeds of such claims available to the Purchaser
regarding any covered events that occurred prior to the Closing under
Covance\'s policies providing insurance coverage on an occurrence basis;
provided, however, that the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that nothing in
this Section 6.07 shall be interpreted as a guarantee by Covance that such
policies will be available under which to make such claims or that
any proceeds will be available to the Purchaser or Covance under such
policies. Purchaser shall reimburse Covance for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in providing the cooperation required by this Section
6.07.   SECTION 6.08. Intercompany Indebtedness. After payment of
the Intercompany Indebtedness pursuant to Section 2.03(a), Covance shall
assure that there are no amounts owing as of Closing (i) from the Company to
Covance or any of its Affiliates, and (ii) from Covance or any of its
Affiliates to the Company.   SECTION 6.09. Covance Guarantees. (a) The
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and Covance shall
cooperate with the Purchaser (provided, however, that Covance and the Company
shall not be required to pay any consideration in connection therewith), to
cause Covance and its Affiliates (other than the Company) to be released as
of the Closing Date, or as soon thereafter as possible, from all guarantees
and guarantee obligations of Covance and such Affiliates relating to
obligations of the Company or otherwise relating to or for the benefit of the
Company or the Business that are listed in Section 6.09 of the Disclosure
Schedule. The Purchaser agrees to indemnify Covance and its Affiliates, in
accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in Article X hereof, for
any and all Losses incurred by Covance and its Affiliates after the Closing
Date arising out of any guarantee or guarantee obligation listed in Section
6.09 of the Disclosure Schedule, whether or not such Losses accrued prior to,
on or after the Closing except for any claims with respect to which Covance
is obligated to indemnify the Purchaser under Section 10.02.   (b)
Notwithstanding the commercially reasonable efforts undertaken by the
Purchaser under Section 6.09(a), the Purchaser shall repay the
Revolving Credit Facility at the Closing if the following conditions have not
been satisfied at or prior to the Closing: (i) the Revolving Credit Agreement
shall be amended so that prior to the Closing there shall not be an Event of
Default (as such term is defined therein) occurring upon the Closing, and
such amendment shall be reasonably satisfactory to Covance and the Purchaser,
and (ii) the Purchaser shall secure a full and unconditional release of
Covance from Covance\'s obligations under the RCF Guaranty, and such release
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Covance.   28  Covance shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, and the Purchaser shall cooperate with
Covance (provided, however, that Covance and the Company shall not be
required to pay any consideration in connection therewith or take any action
with respect to any other credit agreements between Covance and the lender
under the Revolving Credit Agreement), to obtain the amendment to
the Revolving Credit Agreement referred to in Section 6.09(b)(i).   (c) If,
notwithstanding the commercially reasonable efforts undertaken by the
Purchaser under Section 6.09(a), the Purchaser has not, at or prior to the
Closing, secured a full and unconditional release of Covance, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Covance, from Covance\'s obligations under
the Guaranty Agreements, the Purchaser, on behalf of the Company, shall
exercise the purchase option (the "Purchase Option") under Section 20.1A of
each of the Tax Retention Operating Leases as of the Closing, by delivering
to each Lessor (as defined in each Tax Retention Operating Lease) at the
Closing the election to exercise the Purchase Option in accordance with
Section 20.1A of each Tax Retention Operating Lease. In the event that the
Purchaser is required under this Section 6.09(c) to exercise the Purchase
Option, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to acquire the
Property (as such term is defined in the Tax Retention Operating Leases) at
Closing or as soon thereafter as practicable in accordance with the
applicable terms of the Tax Retention Operating Leases.   SECTION 6.10.
Regulatory and Other Authorizations. Each party hereto shall use its
reasonable efforts to obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals of all Governmental Authorities and officials that may be or become
necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of
its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and will cooperate fully with the
other parties in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals. Each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement within five Business Days of the
date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. The parties hereto will not
take any action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding
the receipt of any required approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 6.10, in order to obtain any
authorization, consent, order or approval contemplated herein, the Purchaser
shall not be required to (i) seek to lift any injunction, (ii) pay any
material consideration, (iii) divest itself of any of, or otherwise rearrange
the composition of, its assets or (iv) agree to any conditions
or requirements which are materially adverse or burdensome to the
Purchaser.   SECTION 6.11. Redemption of Company Stock Options. Prior to
the Closing, Covance shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Company to redeem and cancel all outstanding options to acquire shares of the
Company\'s capital stock, under any stock option plan of the Company or
pursuant to any agreement to which the Company or Covance is a party, (a
"Company Stock Option") whether or not such Company Stock Options are
exercisable or whether or not such Company Stock Options are vested.  
SECTION 6.12. Transition Services. (a) Covance shall provide, or cause to be
provided, to the Purchaser, solely for the benefit of the Company, such
intercompany services as set forth in Exhibit 6.12 (each a
"Transition Service" and collectively, the "Transition Services") for a
period beginning on the Closing Date and through the end of the term set
forth in Exhibit 6.12 for each Transition Service (the "Transition Period")
to the extent such Transition Services are requested from time to time by the
Purchaser or the Company during the Transition Period. Covance shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide, or cause to be provided, the Transition
Services during the Transition Period in a manner generally consistent with
the manner and level of care with which such services were previously
performed by Covance and its Affiliates in the conduct of the Business. The
Purchaser shall use its reasonable efforts to replace the Transition Services
with equivalent services as soon as practicable, and in any event, prior to
the expiration of the Transition Period.   (b) The Purchaser hereby agrees
to comply, and cause its Affiliates to comply, in all material respects with
the conditions set forth in Exhibit 6.12 for each Transition Service during
the relevant Transition Period. The Purchaser agrees that Covance and its
Affiliates shall have no responsibility for claims by third parties arising
out of, or relating to, any breach by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
of any of the conditions set forth in Exhibit 6.12 and the Purchaser shall
indemnify Covance and its Affiliates with respect to any such claims.   (c)
The Purchaser shall pay Covance the charge for each Transition Service set
forth in Exhibit 6.12. Covance will present the Purchaser with monthly
invoices for the amounts due. The Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid,
each invoice within thirty days of the date of delivery of the invoice to the
Purchaser. Any late payment shall bear interest from the thirtieth day
after the date of the invoice (the "Payment Due Date") through the date of
payment at the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank N.A. or any
successor thereto in New York, New York from time to time as its base rate
from the Payment Due Date to the date of such payment plus 2%.   29   (d)
The Purchaser shall be entitled, upon reasonable prior notice, to have
reasonable access during business hours to the records of Covance relating to
the Transition Services or to those records of any Affiliate of Covance
providing the Transition Services solely for the purpose of verifying the
accuracy of charges for the Transition Services, provided such access
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business of Covance and its
Affiliates. Any information obtained under this Section 6.12 shall be kept
confidential in accordance with Section 6.04.   (e) The obligations of
Covance to provide Transition Services shall be suspended during any period,
and to the extent, in which Covance is prevented or hindered from complying
therewith by any Law or Governmental Order or by any cause beyond the
reasonable control of Covance, including, without limitation, acts of God,
civil disturbances, acts of war or conditions arising out of or attributable
to war (whether declared or undeclared), shortage of necessary equipment,
materials or labor, or restrictions thereon or limitations upon the use
thereof. In such event, Covance shall give notice of suspension and the cause
thereof, and Covance shall resume the performance of such obligations as soon
as reasonably practicable after the removal of the cause.   (f)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Covance
nor any of its Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives or attorneys-in-fact shall be liable to
the Purchaser or the Company for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
it or such person under or in connection with the provision of Transition
Services pursuant to this Section 6.12, except that Covance shall be liable
for direct losses incurred by the Purchaser arising out of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Covance or its respective
officers, directors, employees, agents or attorneys-in-fact in the
performance of the Transition Services.   SECTION 6.13. Acquisition of the
Remaining Shares. Prior to Closing, Covance shall use its reasonable best
efforts to acquire the Shares owned by the Minority Shareholders, including,
if necessary, by exercising and completing Covance\'s call options under
Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the Capital Contribution and Shareholder Agreement,
dated as of February 22, 1995, by and among the Company, Covance, the
Minority Shareholders and Robert Amundsen.   SECTION 6.14. Further Action;
Best Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws, and execute and
deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required, to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement and to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby.   ARTICLE VII   EMPLOYEE MATTERS  
SECTION 7.01. Employment. For the two year period from the Closing, each
Company Employee (other than Company Employees who are on short-
term disability leave, vacation leave or any other leave) shall continue to
be employed by the Company at an annual rate of pay that is no less than the
annual rate of pay applicable to such Company Employee prior to the Closing;
provided that a Company Employee may be terminated at any time for cause or
in connection with any restructuring or reduction in force. Company Employees
returning from short-term disability leave, vacation leave, or any other
leave shall be offered employment upon their return to active employment on
the same terms as otherwise provided herein for Company Employees if such
return is within 6 months of the Closing Date; provided that this 6 month
period shall not apply to any Company Employee who has a statutory right to
be re-employed by the Company upon termination of such leave.   SECTION
7.02. Benefits. (a) Benefit Plans in General. Immediately prior to the
Closing, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each Company Employee
shall cease to be covered by any benefit plans maintained by Covance or its
Affiliates (other than those sponsored by the Company). For a period of at
least two years following the Closing, each Company Employee shall be covered
by compensation and benefit plans, programs and arrangements of the Purchaser
or its Affiliates including the Company (the "Purchaser Benefit Plans"), that
shall provide Company Employees with compensation and benefits that, in the
aggregate, are comparable to the compensation and benefits enjoyed by the
Company Employees immediately prior to the Closing, other than
those compensation and benefit plans, programs and arrangements providing for
annual cash bonuses or stock options, stock purchase rights or other stock-
based compensation. Each Purchaser Benefit Plan shall grant each Company
Employee credit for all employment with Covance and the Company for purposes
of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and seniority under the Purchaser
Benefit Plans, except to the extent that any such credit   30  would
result in duplication of benefits; provided however, that with respect to the
Purchaser\'s defined benefit pension plan past service will be used only
to determine eligibility to participate, future pay credits and vesting under
the plan. With respect to any medical, dental or other welfare benefits that
are provided to Company Employees under the Purchaser Benefit Plans, any
applicable pre-existing condition exclusions (except to the extent not
satisfied under the comparable Benefit Plans of Covance as of the Closing)
shall be waived, and any expenses incurred before the Closing under the
comparable Benefit Plans of Covance shall be taken into account under the
Purchaser Benefit Plans for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions for any applicable plan year
in which the Closing occurs.   (b) Severance. The amount of severance pay
entitlement on the Closing Date under the Covance Inc. Severance Pay Plan
shall be a preserved severance pay entitlement ("Preserved Severance Amount")
for each Company Employee. Should the employment of a Company Employee be
terminated by the Company upon or after the Closing Date due to a reduction
in force or position elimination or other reason not due to misconduct
(including for the first year after the Closing Date, the transfer of the
Company Employee\'s job to a location more than fifty (50) miles from his
current location of employment which such employee declines to accept), such
employee will receive from the Company severance pay under the Company\'s
severance pay policy which, with respect to service prior to the Closing
Date, shall not be less than the Preserved Severance Amount and, for up to
two years after the Closing Date, shall not be less than what the Company
Employee would have received under the Covance Inc. Severance Pay Plan had
such Company Employee continued to accrue service credit under the Covance
Inc. Severance Pay Plan until the relevant date of termination.   (c)
Retained Employee Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Covance shall retain all
liabilities, obligations and responsibilities for and with respect to (i) any
workers\' compensation claim made by any Company Employee arising from an
event, injury or illness occurring prior to the Closing and payable pursuant
to the terms of any workers\' compensation insurance policy or program
maintained by Covance or an Affiliate of Covance at the time of such event,
injury or illness, except to the extent that any such insurance policy is
maintained by or assigned to the Company, or assigned to the Purchaser or an
Affiliate of the Purchaser, as of the Closing; (ii) any claim for life
insurance, health, dental, medical or similar benefits incurred by a Company
Employee prior to the Closing and payable pursuant to the terms of any
insurance policy maintained by Covance or an Affiliate of Covance in effect
at the time such claim was incurred, except to the extent that claim is
covered in full under an insurance policy maintained by or assigned to the
Company, or assigned to the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser, as of
the Closing; and (iii) any claim for long-term or short-term disability
benefits by a Company Employee in respect of a continuous, uninterrupted
period of absence from work commencing prior to the Closing and payable
pursuant to the terms of any long-term or short-term disability insurance
policy of Covance or an Affiliate of Covance in effect as of the last day of
such Company Employee\'s attendance at work for Covance or an Affiliate
of Covance, except to the extent that such insurance policy is maintained by
or assigned to the Company or assigned to the Purchaser or an Affiliate of
the Purchaser, as of the Closing.   (d) Qualified DC Plans. Effective as of
the Closing, contributions in respect of the Company Employees under each
qualified defined contribution plan of Covance and any Affiliate of Covance,
including, the 401(k) Savings Plan (collectively, the "Covance DC Plan")
shall cease. Effective as of the Closing, the Purchasers shall establish or
designate a qualified defined contribution plan sponsored by the Purchasers
or an Affiliate of the Purchasers (the "Purchaser DC Plan) to provide
benefits to each Company Employee who, at the time of the Closing, was a
participant or eligible to be a participant in the Covance DC Plan (the "DC
Plan Participants"). Each DC Plan Participant shall receive credit under the
Purchaser DC Plan for all service with Covance and each Affiliate of Covance
and their respective predecessors prior to the Closing for the purpose of
vesting and participation as if such service was with Purchaser. The
Purchaser DC Plan shall be qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of
the Code and Purchaser shall provide to Covance as soon as practicable
following the Closing a copy of a favorable determination letter issued by
the IRS stating that the Purchaser DC Plan, meets the qualification
requirements of Sections 401(a) and Section 401(k) of the Code, and Purchaser
represents that, to its knowledge, no fact or event has occurred since the
date of such letter that could be reasonably construed as affecting the
qualified status of the Purchaser DC Plan. All Company Employees who have
account balances in the Covance DC Plan immediately prior to the Closing
shall be fully vested in all of their account balances under the Covance DC
Plan as of the Closing including, without limitation, any account balances
attributable to employer contributions. As soon as practicable after the
Closing, Covance shall make all matching and other contributions with respect
to Company Employees that are payable with respect to periods before the
Closing. Covance will permit each Company Employee who is a participant in
the Covance DC Plan to elect (i) to receive a distribution of the value in
his account less the amount of any outstanding loan to such participant under
the Plan (such participant\'s "Account Balance"), (ii) to roll over
such participant\'s Account Balance to an individual retirement account of
such participant or (iii) to roll over such participant\'s Account Balance in
cash by wire transfer (but for purposes of this clause (iii), a
participant\'s Account Balance shall include the amount of any outstanding
loan under the Covance DC Plan which loan shall also be rolled over) to the
Purchaser 401(k) Plan as soon as practicable after the   31  Closing and
the Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept such transfers,
including administration of any outstanding loans. Covance and Purchaser
shall cooperate to the extent necessary and reasonable to facilitate such
transfer (including to the extent practicable aggregating participant
wire transfers). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement
shall preclude any Company Employee from taking such other action with
respect to his or her account in the Covance DC Plan as may be permitted
under applicable law and under the terms and conditions of the Covance DC
Plan.   (e) Flexible Spending Accounts. With respect to the Covance
Flexible Spending Account Plan ("Flex Plan"), Covance shall take the
reasonable and necessary action to transfer the accounts of the participants
as of the Closing Date in the Flex Plan who are Company Employees ("Flex Plan
Participants") for the 2001 plan year to a plan established by the Purchaser.
The Purchaser shall continue to administer the accounts of the Flex Plan
Participants for the 2001 plan year. The Purchaser will reimburse Covance for
the aggregate amount, if any, reimbursed by Covance under the Flex Plan for
any Flex Plan Participants in excess of amounts withheld from the wages of
such Flex Plan Participants prior to the Closing.   (f) 2001 Annual
Bonuses. The Purchaser shall pay all annual bonuses payable to the Company
Employees for fiscal year 2001 based on the performance targets set forth on
Section 7.02(f)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule. The Purchaser agrees that no
additional bonus (other than incentives provided in connection with the
Retention Program and bonuses payable pursuant to the individual retention
arrangements listed on Section 7.02(f)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule) will
be paid to the Company Employees for fiscal year 2001.   (g) Retention
Program. The Purchaser shall provide to Covance, within 5 days following
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, a statement signed by an officer of the
Purchaser detailing the terms of the Retention Program, the names of the
Company Employees who are eligible to receive incentives pursuant to the
Retention Program, the incentives to be provided thereunder and the
dates such incentives shall be provided.   SECTION 7.03. Employee Visas.
The Purchaser agrees to provide reasonable assistance to the employees
identified in Section 7.03 of the Disclosure Schedule for whom Covance or the
Company is pursuing temporary work authorization or permanent resident status
in the completion of the specific applications or petitions for nonimmigrant
status, Alien Labor Certification, Immigrant Classification, Consular
Processing or Adjustment of Status that are pending on the Closing Date.  
SECTION 7.04. Cooperation. Covance, the Company, the Purchaser agree to
cooperate and to take all steps as shall be reasonably necessary between
the date of this Agreement and the Closing to effect the provisions of this
Article VII. In addition, Covance and the Company agree to provide the
Purchaser with such employment records as shall be reasonably necessary to
permit the Purchaser to calculate any benefits for Company Employees
contemplated by this Article VII.   ARTICLE VIII   TAX MATTERS  
SECTION 8.01. Indemnity. (a) Covance shall be responsible for, and will
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser and the Company against any and all
of the following Taxes (except to the extent current taxes on the
Closing Balance Sheet have been specifically reserved for such Taxes) and
against any loss, damage, liability or out-of-pocket expense, including
reasonable fees for attorneys and other outside consultants, incurred in
contesting or otherwise in connection with any such Taxes: (i) Taxes imposed
on the Company with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods; (ii) with respect to
taxable periods beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the
Closing Date ("Straddle Period"), Taxes imposed on the Company that are
allocable, pursuant to Section 8.01(d), to the portion of such period ending
on the Closing Date (other than Taxes which are the responsibility of the
Purchaser under this Agreement); (iii) Taxes for which the Company may be
held liable as a result of being, prior to Closing, a member of any combined,
consolidated, unitary, affiliated or other similar group for purposes of
filing Returns or paying Taxes, or as a result of being a transferee or
successor of another person; (iv) Taxes imposed on the Company and
resulting from the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
Section 4.17; and/or (v) Taxes resulting from a breach of any covenant or
agreement made by Covance under this Article VIII, provided that, except as
set forth in Section 8.01(b), no indemnity shall be provided under this
Agreement for any reduction in any net operating loss, capital loss or tax
credit carryover allocable to the Company. The Purchaser shall be responsible
for, and will indemnify and hold harmless Covance against, any and all of the
following Taxes (and against any loss, damage, liability or out-of-pocket
expense, including reasonable fees for attorneys and other outside
consultants, incurred in contesting or otherwise in connection with any such
Taxes) (A) Taxes imposed on the Company and not allocated to Covance pursuant
to the first   32  sentence hereof, for all Post-Closing Tax Periods (or
portions thereof in the case of a Straddle Period) except to the extent such
Taxes are otherwise the responsibility of Covance under this Agreement,
and/or (B) Taxes resulting from a breach of any covenant made by the
Purchaser under this Article VIII.   (b) Without duplication of any amounts
indemnified against under Section 8.01(a), Covance agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Purchaser and the Company in the event, and to the extent,
that (i) the Company NOL as reported on the U.S. federal income tax Return
that includes the Company for the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
is less than $49.5 million, or (ii) to the extent not indemnified against
under clause (i), any portion of the Company NOL is permanently disallowed in
any Tax period by the IRS or other relevant Tax authority as a result of a
Final Determination, provided that such permanent disallowance is made solely
on the grounds that the Company NOL is not bona-fide or otherwise not
properly computed as of the Closing Date, and provided further that no
indemnification shall be provided by Covance to the extent that the Company
NOL, after any such permanent disallowance, still equals or exceeds $49.5
million. The indemnification amount shall be determined as follows: (A)
in the case of an indemnity payable under Section 8.01(b)(i), an amount equal
to the product of (a) the excess of $49.5 million over the amount of the
Company NOL, and (b) 40 percent; (B) in the case of an indemnity payable
under Section 8.01(b)(ii), an amount equal to the product of (c) the amount
of the Company NOL permanently disallowed, and (d) the sum of the highest
marginal federal, state and local income tax rates (computed on an after-Tax
basis) actually applicable to the Company\'s income for any year with respect
to which such disallowance is made; and (C) in the case of any actual
penalties and interest caused by the permanent disallowance of any portion of
the Company NOL, the amount of such penalties and interest (computed on an
after-Tax basis).   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, no indemnity shall be due from Covance to the Purchaser to
the extent that (i) a portion of the Company NOL is disallowed as a deduction
in one taxable period but reattributed to another taxable period for which
the Purchaser or an Affiliate can receive a deduction in respect of that
portion of the Company NOL, or (ii) the Purchaser fails to utilize the
Company NOL during their carryover period following the Closing Date or
commits any act of omission or commission that causes a permanent
disallowance of all or a portion of the Company NOL.   (d) In the case of
Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any
such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing
Date shall be deemed equal to:   (i) in the case of Taxes that are based
upon or related to income or  receipts, or measured by capital, the amount
which would be payable if the  taxable year ended with the Closing Date;
and   (ii) in the case of Taxes (including property Taxes) imposed on a 
periodic basis or Taxes measured by the level of any item not described in 
clause (i), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the  case
of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such  Taxes for
the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the  numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on  the Closing
Date, and the denominator of which is the number of calendar  days in the
entire period.   SECTION 8.02. Tax Covenants. (a) The Purchaser (i) will not
effect any transactions on the Closing Date (other than any such transactions
expressly required by this Agreement) that could result in Tax liability to
the Company, Covance or its Affiliates in excess of any Tax liability
associated with the conduct of business in the ordinary course; (ii) will not
make or change any tax election, amend any Return, or take any other action
that will result in any material increase in the Tax liability of Covance in
respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period, unless otherwise required by
applicable law; (iii) will not make any election under Section 338 of the
Code (or under any analogous or similar rules in any other Tax jurisdiction)
with respect to the acquisition of the Shares under this Agreement; and (iv)
will forego and otherwise relinquish (and cause the Company to forego and
otherwise relinquish), by way of election or otherwise, any carryback of any
net operating loss or other Tax attribute to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and
will elect under Section 172(b)(3) of the Code (or under any analogous or
similar rules in any other Tax jurisdiction) to relinquish the entire
carryback period.   (b) Covance will not cause the Company to make or change
any tax election, amend any Return, or take any other action that will result
in any material increase in the Tax liability of the Purchaser in respect of
any taxable period ending after the Closing Date, unless otherwise required
by applicable law. For any taxable period that the Company was included in
a consolidated or combined return with Covance, Covance and the Company will
elect to forego the carryback of the Company NOL to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods.   33    SECTION 8.03. Returns and Payments. From the date of
this Agreement through and after the Closing Date, Covance shall prepare and
file or otherwise furnish in proper form to the appropriate Governmental
Authority (or cause to be prepared and filed or so furnished) in a timely
manner (taking into account all applicable extensions) all Returns relating
to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Purchaser shall do the
same for Returns relating to the Company with respect to any Post-Closing Tax
Period and for any Straddle Periods. Returns of or including the Company not
yet filed for any taxable period that begins before the Closing Date shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice (including with respect to
elections) with respect to the Company (except to the extent there is no
reasonable basis in Law for a position taken in such Return). With respect to
any Return required to be filed by the Purchaser or Covance with respect to
the Company and as to which an amount of Tax is allocable to the non-filing
party under Section 8.01(d), the filing party shall provide the other party
and its authorized representatives with a copy of such completed Return and a
statement certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Return that is allocable
to such other party pursuant to Section 8.01(d), together with appropriate
supporting information and schedules at least thirty (30) days prior to the
due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of such Return, and
such other party and its authorized representatives shall have the right to
review and comment on such Return and statement prior to the filing of such
Return. Covance and the Purchaser agree to consult and resolve in good faith
any dispute arising out of any such Return. In the event the parties are
unable to resolve any dispute within twenty (20) days following the
delivery of such Return to the other party, the parties shall resolve their
dispute by jointly requesting that an Independent Accounting Firm that is not
the past or then current principal auditors of the Purchaser or Covance or
any of their respective Affiliates resolve any issue before the due date of
such Return, in order that such Return may be timely filed. The scope of the
Independent Accounting Firm\'s review shall be limited to the disputed items.
Covance shall pay one-half, and the Purchaser shall pay one-half, of the
Independent Accounting Firm\'s fees and expenses for this purpose. As to any
other Return for or including the Company to be filed by Covance, Covance
shall deliver to Purchaser such Return (or portions thereof which relate to
the Company) and supporting information for the Purchaser\'s review and
consent, which consent shall not to be withheld unless there is no reasonable
basis for taking one or more positions in such Return, at least twenty (20)
days prior to the due date (including any applicable extensions thereof) for
the filing of such Return, provided, however, that in no event shall the
Purchaser have any rights to inspect or review the books, records, Returns or
any other proprietary documents (including work papers) of Covance that do
not involve the Company.   SECTION 8.04. Filing of Amended Tax Returns.
Covance shall be responsible for filing any amended consolidated, unitary or
other combined Returns relating to the Company for Pre-Closing Tax Periods,
including those that are required as a result of examination adjustments made
by the Internal Revenue Service or by the applicable state, local or foreign
Tax authorities for such taxable years as finally determined. For those
jurisdictions or Pre-Closing Tax Periods in which separate Returns are or
have been filed by the Company, any required amended Returns, including those
resulting from the IRS\'s or other Tax authority\'s examination adjustments,
as finally determined for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, shall be prepared by
Covance and furnished to the Company for consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), signature and filing at least 10 days prior to the
due date for filing such Returns. The Purchaser shall not file or permit the
Company to file an amended Return for a Straddle Period without the prior
written consent of Covance, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  
SECTION 8.05. Refunds and Credits. Any Tax refund or credit (including by way
of offset), or any interest with respect thereto, relating to the Company for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be the property of Covance, and if received
by the Purchaser, the Company or any Affiliate shall be payable promptly to
Covance. The Purchaser shall permit Covance, at Covance\'s expense, to direct
the prosecution of any such refund claim and, where deemed appropriate by
Covance, shall authorize by appropriate powers of attorney such Persons
as Covance shall designate as representatives with respect to such refund
claim. Any Tax refund or credit (including by way of offset), or any interest
with respect thereto, relating to the Company for any Straddle Period shall
be shared equitably between Covance and the Purchaser.   SECTION 8.06.
Contests. (a) After the Closing, the Purchaser shall promptly notify Covance
in writing of any written notice or any communication from the IRS or other
Tax authority, in the context of an audit, examination, request for
information or otherwise, of any matter that could give rise to a right of
indemnification under Article VIII (a "Tax Claim"). Such notice of a Tax
Claim shall state the nature of the claim, amount indemnified against,
if known, and the method of computing such amount. If notice of a Tax Claim
is not given promptly after receipt of such communication by the Purchaser,
or in reasonable detail to inform Covance of the nature of the Tax Claim, in
each case taking into account the facts and circumstances with respect to
such Tax Claim, Covance shall not be liable to the Purchaser, but only to the
extent that Covance\'s position is actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure to so promptly notify or inform.   (b) In the case of a Tax Claim
that relates to one or more Pre-Closing Tax Periods, Covance shall have the
right, at its own expense, to participate in and control the conduct of all
proceedings in connection with such Tax Claim   34  (including selection
of counsel). Covance shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, such Tax Claim without Purchaser\'s prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If Covance
does not elect to contest any such audit or proceeding, the Purchaser may
defend the same in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including, but not
limited to, settling such audit or proceeding after giving five days\' prior
written notice to Covance setting forth the terms and conditions of
settlement, and, if Covance does not so elect, Covance shall reimburse the
Purchaser for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable
attorney and accountant fees) in connection with contesting any proposed
disallowance of the Company NOL to the extent such proposed disallowance
would cause the Company NOL to be less than $49.5 million.   (c) With
respect to issues included in a Tax Claim relating to a potential adjustment
for which both Covance and the Purchaser could be liable, (i) each party may
participate in the audit or proceeding, and (ii) the audit or proceeding
shall be controlled by that party which would bear the burden of the greater
portion of the sum of the adjustment. The principle set forth in
the preceding sentence shall govern also for purposes of deciding any issue
that must be decided jointly (in particular, choice of judicial forum) in
situations in which separate issues are otherwise jointly controlled under
this Article VIII by the Purchaser and Covance. Neither party shall admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Tax
issues or claim without the other party\'s prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   (d) Notwithstanding Section
8.06(c) hereof, with respect to any proposed disallowance of the Company NOL
for any Post-Closing Tax Period indemnified against by Covance under Section
8.01(b)(ii) (an "NOL Tax Claim"), the Purchaser will contest such NOL Tax
Claim in good faith, and will not take any action with respect to such
contest and NOL Tax Claim without the consent of Covance (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld) for a 30-day period after delivery of notice of such
NOL Tax Claim to Covance; provided, however, that (i) within 25 days after
Covance has been notified in writing by the Purchaser of the NOL Tax Claim,
Covance shall request in writing that such NOL Tax Claim be contested; and
(ii) the conduct of such contest shall remain within the control of the
Purchaser and its counsel (who shall be independent tax counsel of national
reputation, selected by the Purchaser and reasonably satisfactory
to Covance); provided further that, without limiting the right of the
Purchaser to control any NOL Tax Claim contest, the Purchaser shall consult
in good faith with Covance with respect to any Tax Proceeding related to such
NOL Tax Claim, including, without limitation, keeping Covance informed of
material developments with respect to such Tax Proceeding on a timely basis,
providing Covance with the Purchaser\'s material written submissions or
replies with respect to such Tax Proceeding prior to filing thereof with such
authority or with the relevant court, and copies of documents actually filed
in such Tax Proceeding, and considering in good faith the comments and views
of Covance with respect to the conduct of such Tax Proceeding.   (e)
Covance shall reimburse Purchaser for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including attorney and accountant fees) of contesting an NOL Tax Claim as
such expenses are incurred and the Purchaser delivers materials to Covance
evidencing such expenses. The Purchaser shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any NOL Tax Claim
without Covance\'s prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Covance shall advance to Purchaser sufficient funds
for Purchaser to pay any Tax contested in any Tax Proceeding pertaining to
any portion of the Company NOL in which the Tax contested must be paid prior
to, or upon commencement of such Tax Proceeding. Following a Final
Determination of an NOL Tax Claim, the Purchaser shall refund to Covance any
amounts advanced for this purpose (together with any related amounts of
interest received) that are in excess of amounts finally determined to be due
by Covance in respect of such NOL Tax Claim under this Agreement.   SECTION
8.07. Time of Payment. (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.07(b),
payment by an indemnitor of any amounts due under Section 8.01 in respect of
Taxes shall be made not more than five Business Days following written notice
by the indemnitee that payment of an indemnified amount is due to the
appropriate Tax authority or other appropriate party, provided that, in
the case of any payment due to a Tax authority, the indemnitor shall not be
required to make any payment earlier than two Business Days before it is due
to such Tax authority. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance
with the provisions of Section 8.06 (other than a Tax contested in any
administrative or judicial proceeding in which the Tax contested must be paid
prior to, or upon commencement of, such proceeding), payment of the Tax to
the appropriate Tax authority will not be considered to be due earlier than
the date a Final Determination has been made. If liability under this Article
VIII is in respect of costs or expenses other than Taxes, payment by an
indemnitor of any amounts due under this Article VIII shall be made not more
than five Business Days after the date when the indemnitor is obligated to
make an indemnity payment under this Article VIII and is provided with
calculations or other materials supporting such liability.   35   (b)
Payment by Covance of any amounts of Taxes indemnified against under section
8.01(b)(i) shall be made 5 Business Days after the date that Covance delivers
a copy of the U.S. federal income Return that includes the Company for the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date to the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 8.03 hereof.   SECTION 8.08. Cooperation and Exchange of
Information. Covance and the Purchaser will provide each other with such
cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of the
other in filing any Return, amended Return or claim for refund, determining a
liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes, participating in or
conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant
Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related
work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax
authorities, provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall require
Covance to provide copies or other information relating to its consolidated
or combined Returns, except insofar as they relate directly to the Company.
Covance shall make its employees available on a basis mutually convenient to
both parties to provide explanations of any documents or information provided
hereunder. Each of Covance and the Purchaser shall retain all Returns,
schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its possession
relating to Tax matters of the Company for each taxable period first ending
after the Closing Date and for all prior taxable periods until the later of
(i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods
to which such Returns and other documents relate, without regard to
extensions except to the extent notified by the other party in writing of
such extensions for the respective Tax periods, or (ii) six years following
the due date (including extensions) for such Returns. Any information
obtained under this Section 8.08 shall be kept confidential in accordance
with Section 6.04 except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other
proceeding.   SECTION 8.09. Conveyance Taxes. The Purchaser shall pay and
be liable for any and all real or personal property transfer, sales, use,
value added, stock transfer, stamp, recording, registration, and any similar
Taxes which become payable in connection with the acquisition of the Shares,
as contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser, with the assistance of
Covance, shall file such applications and documents as shall permit any such
Tax to be assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance
with any available pre-sale filing procedure. The Purchaser and Covance shall
execute and deliver all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the
parties to comply with the foregoing.   SECTION 8.10. Miscellaneous. (a)
Covance and the Purchaser agree to treat all payments made by either to or
for the benefit of the other (including any payments to the Company) under
this Article VIII, under other indemnity provisions of this Agreement and for
any misrepresentations or breach of warranties or covenants as adjustments to
the Purchase Price or as capital contributions for Tax purposes, and such
treatment shall govern for purposes hereof, unless otherwise determined by a
Tax authority as a result of a Final Determination.   (b) Notwithstanding
any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4.17 will survive until the expiration of 120
days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to the Tax liabilities in question (giving effect to any waiver,
mitigation or extension thereof). The covenants, agreements and indemnities
of each party contained in this Article VIII shall survive indefinitely
(except as may be specified therein).   (c) Covance shall cause the
provisions of any Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreement between the
Company, on the one hand, and any other Person, on the other hand, to be
terminated on or before the Closing Date.   ARTICLE IX   CONDITIONS TO THE

except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, materially and
adversely affect the ability of the Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that if any portion of any
representation or warranty is already qualified by materiality or similar
qualifiers, for purposes of determining whether this Section 9.01(c) has been
satisfied with respect to such portion of such representation or warranty,
such portion of such representation or warranty as so qualified must be true
and correct in all respects; and the covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement to be complied with by the Purchaser on or before the Closing

all material respects as of the date made), except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect; provided, however,
that if any portion of any representation or warranty is already qualified by
Material Adverse Effect, for purposes of determining whether this Section
9.02(c) has been satisfied with respect to such portion of such
representation or warranty, such portion of such representation or warranty
as so qualified must be true and correct in all respects; and the covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied with by Covance on
or before the Closing shall have been complied with in all material respects.
The Purchaser shall have received a certificate of Covance to such effect
signed by a duly authorized officer thereof.   (d) Cancellation of Company

Indemnification by Covance. Covance agrees from and after the Closing,
subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, to indemnify the
Purchaser and each of its officers, directors and employees, and each of the
heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the
foregoing (collectively the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") and hold the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties harmless for any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs and expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses) (hereinafter a "Loss") actually suffered or incurred by such
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, arising out of or resulting from (A) any
breach of representation or warranty (determined for such purpose as if all
references in the representations and warranties contained in Articles III
and IV to Material Adverse Effect or materiality were deleted, other than in
Sections 4.05, 4.06, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11 (only with respect to the reference to

this Agreement, (B) any claim or assertion made by any Person allegedly
arising out of such person\'s rights as a shareholder, optionholder, putative

the Closing Date, of permit limitations applicable to nitrogen in the
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina facility (the "Facility") wastewater,
as disclosed in Section 10.02(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, provided that if
such Losses include costs of modifications to the Facility\'s wastewater
treatment system ("Modification Costs"), such Modification Costs shall be
subject to the indemnification provided by this clause 10.02(C) only if they
are (i) reasonable and necessary to prevent recurrence of exceedances of such
nitrogen limits, taking into account the feasibility and practicality of such
Modification Costs and their proportionality to the effectiveness of the
modifications made to ensure compliance with nitrogen limits, and (ii) are
incurred within one year of the Closing Date, and provided further, that any
Losses or Modification Costs identified in this clause 10.02(C) shall be
subject to the indemnification provided by this clause 10.02(C) only if such
Losses or Modification Costs are not caused by the Purchaser\'s failure to
properly maintain or operate the wastewater treatment system or by material
changes by the Purchaser to Facility operations inconsistent with normal
operations of the Facility as of the Closing Date.   SECTION 10.03.
Indemnification by the Purchaser. The Purchaser agrees from and after the

or resulting from:   (i) the breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or  agreement of the Purchaser herein; and   (ii) any and all
Losses suffered or incurred by Covance or any of  its Affiliates by reason of

respect to which Covance is obligated  to indemnify the Purchaser under
Section 10.02.   SECTION 10.04. Limits on Indemnification. (a)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Covance
shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties against or reimburse the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
for any Loss arising from a breach of representation or warranty contained in
Article III or IV pursuant to Section 10.02, unless (i) the Purchaser
Indemnified Party has notified Covance in writing in accordance with Section
10.05 within the applicable survival period, if any, set forth in Section
10.01, (ii) such Loss exceeds $35,000 (nor shall any Loss below such amount
be applied to or considered for purposes of the next clause (iii) and the
first proviso thereafter), and (iii) the aggregate of all of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties\' Losses under Section 10.02 exceeds $2 million (in which
event Covance shall be liable only for the excess of such Losses over $2
million); provided, however, that in no event shall the aggregate liability
of Covance under this Agreement exceed an amount equal to 50% of the Purchase
Price (as adjusted pursuant to Sections 2.07, 2.09 and 2.10); provided
further however, that the foregoing limitations shall not apply to Losses
arising out of any breach of (A) any covenant contained in this Agreement,
(B) the representations and warranties of Covance set forth in Section 3.02,
4.02, 4.17 or 4.22, (C) any amounts payable under Sections 2.09 and 2.10 and
(D) the indemnity provided by Covance in Section 10.02(B) and (C).   38  
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Covance shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any
Purchaser Indemnified Party against or reimburse any Purchaser
Indemnified Party for any Losses pursuant to Section 10.02 (A), if any such
claim or demand otherwise was adjudicated or otherwise resolved in connection
with the Purchase Price adjustment procedures set forth in Section 2.08.  
SECTION 10.05. Notice and Defense of Claims. (a) Any party
seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 10.02 or 10.03 above (an
"Indemnified Party") shall give prompt notice to Covance, if pursuant to
Section 10.02, or to the Purchaser, if pursuant to Section 10.03 (each, as is
applicable, the "Indemnifying Party") of any matter which an Indemnified
Party has determined has given or could give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement, stating the amount of the Loss, if
known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of
indemnification is claimed or arises. The obligations and Liabilities of the
Indemnifying Party under this Article X with respect to Losses arising from
claims of any third party which are subject to the indemnification provided
for in this Article X ("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by and
contingent upon the additional terms and conditions set forth in this Section
10.05. If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice of such
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice
shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under
this Article X except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure.   (b) The Indemnified Party shall be
entitled, at the sole expense of the Indemnifying Party, to exercise full
control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claim
unless the Indemnifying Party, within ten days of the receipt of such notice
from the Indemnified Party, notifies the Indemnified Party in writing of the
Indemnifying Party\'s assumption of the defense thereof; provided, however,
that notwithstanding the assumption of such defense, the Indemnifying Party
reserves the right to contest the Indemnified Party\'s right to
indemnification under this Agreement in connection with such Third Party
Claim, to the extent that any facts or circumstances exist that, in the
opinion of the Indemnifying Party, indicate that the Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement in connection with
such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party so assumes the defense of
any such Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall retain legal
counsel that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to conduct
the defense of such Third Party Claim, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel and participate in (but not
control) the defense, compromise or settlement thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in any manner
the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, and the Indemnifying Party
shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses in connection therewith. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), settle, compromise or consent to entry of any
judgment with respect to any Third Party Claim (i) in which relief other than
the payment of money damages is or may be sought against such Indemnified
Party, or (ii) which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant, petitioner or plaintiff a full and unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party.   (c) In the event that the Indemnified
Party is exercising full control of the defense against any Third Party Claim
pursuant to Section 10.05(b), the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in any manner the Indemnified Party may reasonably request,
at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense. If the Indemnified Party proposes to
settle such claim or proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon or to
forego any appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof and shall not settle any
such Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume or reassume the
defense of such claim or proceeding under the terms of Section 10.05(b).  
SECTION 10.06. Tax Matters. Anything in this Article X (except for the
specific reference to Tax matters in Section 10.01) to the
contrary notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with
respect to indemnification for any and all Tax matters shall be governed by
Article VIII.   SECTION 10.07. Exclusive Remedies. Except as set forth in
this Agreement, neither party is making any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement with respect to the matters contained herein. Anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right
on the part of any party, after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each party\'s sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing for
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement by any party shall be determined in accordance with this
Article X.   39   Subject to the Purchaser\'s right to indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.02, from and after the Closing, (i) the Purchaser
shall fully release Covance from any Environmental Liability incurred by the
Purchaser, their subsidiaries, divisions and Affiliates, their predecessors,
successors and assigns, and their officers, directors, employees and agents;
(ii) the Purchaser hereby waives on their behalf and on behalf of their
subsidiaries, divisions and Affiliates, their predecessors, successors and
assigns, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, any claim or remedy against Covance
now or hereafter available under any applicable Environmental Law, including
CERCLA or any similar federal, state or foreign law, whether or not in
existence on the date hereof; and (iii) the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Covance against and reimburse Covance for any Environmental
Liability that Covance, its subsidiaries, divisions and Affiliates, its
predecessors, successors and assigns, and its officers, directors, employees
and agents may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result
of or in connection with any Environmental Liability.   ARTICLE XI  
TERMINATION AND WAIVER   SECTION 11.01. Termination. This Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the Closing:   (i) by either Covance or the
Purchaser if the Closing shall not have  occurred for any reason by August 1,
2001 (the "Termination Date"); or   (ii) by the Purchaser, if Covance
materially breaches this Agreement  such that the closing conditions set
forth in Section 9.01, would be  incapable of being satisfied by the
Termination Date; or   (iii) by Covance, if the Purchaser materially
breaches this  Agreement such that the closing conditions set forth in
Section 9.02,  would be incapable of being satisfied by the Termination Date;
or   (iv) by Covance or the Purchaser, in the event that an injunction is 
issued by any Governmental Authority against either the Purchaser or 
Covance, restraining, preventing or otherwise prohibiting the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, and such injunction shall have become  final
and nonappealable; or   (v) by the mutual written consent of Covance and the
Purchaser.   SECTION 11.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of
termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 11.01, (a) this
Agreement shall forthwith become void, except as set forth in Section 6.04
and Article XII, and (b) there shall be no liability on the part of any party
hereto, except that nothing herein shall relieve a party from liability if
such party commits a willful breach of this Agreement.   SECTION 11.03.
Waiver. Any party to this Agreement may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
parties contained herein or in any document delivered by the other parties
pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions of the other parties contained herein. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the parties to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall
not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver
of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition, of
this Agreement. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.   ARTICLE
XII   GENERAL PROVISIONS   SECTION 12.01. Expenses. Except as otherwise
specified in this Agreement, all costs and expenses, including, without
limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and
accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
