Section 2.04 _Proposed Closing Statement and Final Closing Statement_.

 

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date (the " _Preparation Period_
"), Buyer shall provide to Seller the Proposed Closing Statement. If Buyer
fails to timely deliver the Proposed Closing Statement, the Estimated Closing
Statement shall become conclusive and binding upon the parties as the Final
Closing Statement. During the Preparation Period, Seller shall (and shall
cause its Affiliates and Representatives to) provide Buyer and its
Representatives with full access to all books and records of Seller and its
Affiliates used in preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement, and Seller
shall promptly, and in any event within such time frame as reasonably
required by Buyer, make available the individuals in its and its Affiliates
or Representatives employ who previously provided financial and/or accounting
services to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries and who are knowledgeable
about the information used in preparing the Estimated Closing Statement to

2  for information by, Buyer or its Representatives. The parties agree that the
Preparation Period shall be extended on a day-for-day basis for any period in

Review Period, Buyer shall (and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives
to) provide Seller and its Representatives with full access to Buyers work
papers and all books and records of Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) used in, or relevant
to, the preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement or used in, or

shall promptly, and in any event within such time frame as reasonably required
by Seller, make available the individuals in its and its Affiliates or
Representatives employ as well as Representatives of its independent

Seller or its Representatives. The parties agree that the Review Period shall
be extended on a day-for-day basis for any period in which Buyer does not
provide, or cause to be provided, the access and/or information required by
the preceding sentence. Buyer agrees that, following the Closing through the
date that the Final Closing Statement becomes conclusive and binding upon the
parties in accordance with this _Article II_ , it will not (and will cause
its Affiliates not to) take any actions with respect to any books, records,
policies or procedures on which the Proposed Closing Statement is based, or on
which the Final Closing Statement is to be based, that would impede or delay
the determination of the Final Closing Debt Amount, Final Working Capital,
Final Closing Cash or the preparation of the Dispute Notice or the Final
Closing Statement in the manner and utilizing the methods required by this
Agreement. 

(c) If Seller disputes any item set forth in the Proposed Closing Statement,
Seller shall, during the Review Period, deliver written notice to Buyer of
the same, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute and
Sellers proposed modifications to the Proposed Closing Statement (such
notice, the " _Dispute Notice_ "). During the thirty (30)-day period
immediately following Sellers delivery of a Dispute Notice (the " _Resolution
Period_ "), Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to reach an
agreement as to any matters identified in such Dispute Notice as being
in dispute, and, to the extent such matters are so resolved within the
Resolution Period, then the Proposed Closing Statement, as revised to
incorporate such changes as have been agreed between Buyer and Seller, shall
be conclusive and binding upon the parties as the Final Closing Statement. If
Seller fails to notify Buyer of any disputes within the Review Period relating
to the Proposed Closing Statement, the Proposed Closing Statement shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties as the Final Closing Statement at the
end of the Review Period.

(d) If Buyer and Seller fail to resolve all such matters in dispute within
the Resolution Period, then (subject to the last sentence of _Section
2.04(e)_) any matters identified in such Dispute Notice that remain in dispute
following the expiration of the Resolution Period shall be finally and
conclusively determined by Deloitte LLP, or if Deloitte LLP is unable or
unwilling to serve in such capacity, Ernst and Young LLP (and if both Deloitte
LLP and Ernst and Young LLP are unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity,
such other globally recognized accounting firm as shall be agreed upon in
writing by Seller and Buyer) (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ").

 



3 (e) Seller and Buyer shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to
promptly, but no later than thirty (30) days after its acceptance of its
appointment, determine (it being understood that in making such determination,
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be functioning as an expert and not as
an arbitrator), based solely on written presentations of Buyer and Seller
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm and not by independent review,
only those matters in dispute and render a written report setting forth its
determination as to the disputed matters and the resulting calculations of

Accounting Firm pursuant to _Section 2.04(e)_, then the fees and expenses of
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by the parties.

 

Section 2.05 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. If there is a Final Positive
Adjustment, then Buyer shall pay an amount equal to the Final Positive
Adjustment to Seller. If there is a Final Negative Adjustment, then Seller
shall repay an amount equal to Final Negative Adjustment to Buyer. Any payment
due under this _Section 2.05_ shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by Seller or
Buyer, as applicable, within ten (10) days after the date on which the Final
Closing Statement becomes conclusive and binding on the parties in accordance
with the provisions of  _Section 2.04_.

Section 2.06 _Certain Calculation Principles_. Each Closing Statement shall be
(a) in a format substantially similar to, and prepared and determined in
accordance with, the Sample Closing Statement; and (b) consistent with the

concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (it being
understood that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the Section
or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds and each other Section

that such information is relevant to such other Section or subsection upon a
reading of the disclosure) (the " _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ "), Seller
hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

Section 4.01 _Authority_. Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly

and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance
with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors
rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of
equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

 



7 Section 4.02 _No Conflicts; Consents; Compliance with Laws_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller does not, and the
execution and delivery of the Other Transaction Documents by Seller will not,

a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to
loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any liens,
claims, encumbrances, security interests, options, charges or restrictions of
any kind (" _Liens_ ") upon any of the properties or Assets of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws (or the comparable governing instruments) of Seller,
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) any Order, or, subject

(as opposed to any other third partys) participation in the Transactions or
(iii) such consents, approvals, permits, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings, the absence of which or the failure

recordations and certificates in connection with such Company Registered
Intellectual Property have been filed with the appropriate Governmental
Entity, except where such failure would not materially affect the rights of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary in any such Company Registered
Intellectual Property. None of the Company Registered Intellectual
Property has been adjudged invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction, in whole or part, and all Company Registered Intellectual
Property is subsisting, and to the knowledge of Seller is valid and, to the
extent a registration has issued thereon, enforceable. As of the date hereof,
no Action (including any opposition, interference, or re-examination) is
pending or to Sellers knowledge, threatened, which challenges the legality,
validity, enforceability, use, or ownership of such right or item, other than
routine office actions of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, U.S. Copyright
Office or foreign counterparts pertaining to Company Registered Intellectual
Property.

 

(b) The Company and/or one or more of the Company Subsidiaries has good and
marketable title and exclusive ownership of the material Owned Intellectual
Property Rights, free and clear of any Liens, except for Permitted Liens or
non-exclusive licenses with respect to Owned Intellectual Property Rights
granted in the ordinary course of business. To the knowledge of Seller, as of
the date hereof, there is no outstanding order, judgment or stipulation made
against Seller restricts the use, transfer or licensing of the Owned
Intellectual Property Rights by the Company or any Company Subsidiary except
as would not materially affect the rights of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in such Owned Intellectual Property Rights. Seller has not received
any written notice or claim challenging its ownership of any of the Owned
Intellectual Property Rights (in whole or in part), nor to the knowledge of
Seller is there a reasonable basis for any such claim.

(c) To Sellers knowledge, the operation of the business of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not infringe, violate or
misappropriate the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received written notice from
any third party, or to Sellers knowledge, oral charge, complaint, claim or
demand, in each case in the past five (5) years, that the operation of the
business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including the making,
using, or selling of any Company Product infringes, violates or
misappropriates the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party. To
Sellers knowledge, no person is infringing, violating or misappropriating any
material Owned Intellectual Property Rights in a manner that would have a
material adverse impact on the business or financial performance of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, this _Section 4.11(c)_ contains the only representations
and warranties with respect to infringement or misappropriation of
Intellectual Property Rights of any third party.

(d) All Owned Intellectual Property Rights are, and after the Closing date
will be, fully transferable, alienable, and licensable by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries without restriction and without payment of any kind to
any third party and without approval of any third party to the extent such
Owned Intellectual Property Rights were transferable, alienable, and
licensable by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
Date. Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby shall constitute a default under, give
rise to cancellation rights under, terminate any Companys or Company
Subsidiarys access to or rights to use or otherwise adversely affect any of
the rights of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under, any agreement
required to be disclosed in _Section 4.12(a)(iv)(y)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule.

 



16 (e) Except as set forth in Section 4.11 (e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
Seller, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have taken commercially
reasonable steps to protect the rights of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in the confidential information and trade secrets of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries or any trade secrets or confidential information
of third parties provided to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and,
without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
required each employee and consultant who has contributed to the creation or
development of any material Owned Intellectual Property Rights (including in
any Company Software) or with access to any trade secrets or confidential
information included in the Owned Intellectual Property Rights to execute a

applicable Companys or the applicable Company Subsidiarys standard form, a
true and complete copy of which has been provided to Buyer. Except
as disclosed in _Section 4.11(e)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, all
such employees and consultants of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries have
executed such forms and Seller has provided Buyer with true and complete
copies of all such executed forms. To the knowledge of Seller, there has been

Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of Seller, no current or former
employee of the Company or Company Subsidiary who contributed to the creation
or development of any material Owned Intellectual Property Rights has
performed services for the government, a university, college or other
educational institution, or a research center, during a period of time during
which the employee was also performing services for the Company or a Company
Subsidiary.

(g) The computer, information technology, and data processing systems,
facilities, and services used by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the
" _Systems_ ") are reasonably sufficient for the existing needs of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of Seller, no person has
gained unauthorized access to any of the Systems that would compromise to any
material degree the value or confidentiality of such Systems or that would
necessitate that the Company or any Company Subsidiary notify a third person
of such unauthorized access. Except as set forth in _Section 4.11(g)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
implemented all critical security patches provided by third party licensors
for the Systems. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have disaster
recovery plans and procedures for the Business. The Company maintains policies
and procedures regarding data security and privacy that are commercially
reasonable and in material compliance with Applicable Law. To the knowledge of
Seller, there has been no material security breach relating to, violation of
any security policy regarding, or unauthorized access or unauthorized use
of, the Systems.

(h) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries maintain backup copies of the
Company Software in accordance with standard industry practice. The Company
and the

 



17  Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Open Source Licenses with
respect to Open Source Software forming any portion of the Company Products.
Except as set forth on Section 4.11(h) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no
person other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and any of their
respective employees who contributed to the development of any Company
Software and any of their respective contractors who contributed to the
development of the Company Software, has or had a copy of, or has or had the
right to access now or at some time in the future, any source code for Company
Software. No portion of the Company Products authored by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries contains, and, to the Sellers knowledge, no other
portion of the Company Products contains, any disabling device, virus, worm,
back door, Trojan horse, or other disruptive or malicious code that is

otherwise permit unauthorized access to, delete, or damage any computer
system, software, network, or data into any products of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries or the Systems.

Intellectual Property Rights that Seller may have caused the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries to assign to Seller or any of its subsidiaries at any
time prior to the Closing to the extent relating to the business of the

Exception. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach
on the part of Buyer under any term or condition of the Financing Commitment.
As of the date of this Agreement (a) Buyer is not aware of any fact or
occurrence that makes any of the assumptions, or the representations or
warranties of Buyer, in the Financing Commitment inaccurate in any material
respect, (b) assuming compliance by each of Seller, the Company and each of
the Company Subsidiaries with its respective obligations set forth in _Section
8.08_ hereof, Buyer has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the

conditions set forth in Sections 3.01(a), 3.01(e) and 3.02 have been
satisfied and (ii) the completion of the Marketing Period, Buyer will have
sufficient funds to satisfy all of Buyers obligations under this Agreement,
including the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Interest and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Other Transaction
Documents upon the terms set forth herein and therein, including the payment
of the Purchase Price and all related fees and expenses associated with the
foregoing. Buyer acknowledges that its obligations under this Agreement are
not conditioned upon or subject to its receipt of the proceeds made available
under the Financing Commitment or any other Financing (such obligations being
subject only to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section
3.01_).

 



34 Section 6.07 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission from Buyer or any of
Buyers Affiliates in connection with the Transactions other than such fees

responsibility of Seller.

 

Section 6.08 _Certain Arrangements_. There are no agreements, contracts or
instruments, or commitments to enter into agreements, contracts or
instruments, between Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
director or officer or, to the knowledge of Buyer, employee of the Company or
any Significant Company Subsidiary, on the other hand.

 

Section 6.09 _Solvency_. Assuming the representations and warranties of Seller
are true and correct in such respects to the extent required by the first
sentence of _Section 3.01(a)_, immediately after the Closing and after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the payment of the
Purchase Price and the payment of all fees and expenses related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and each of the
Company Subsidiaries will be Solvent.

 

Section 6.10 _Certain Matters_. Buyer has provided to Seller, prior to the
date hereof, true and correct copies of the most recent audited consolidated
balance sheet of Buyer and related audited consolidated statement of
operations and comprehensive income for Buyer, and, except as disclosed in
Buyers public filings prior to the date hereof with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, such financial statements fairly present in all
material respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis, the
consolidated financial position of Buyer as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of operations and comprehensive income of Buyer for the
periods then ended. Since the date of its most recent audited consolidated
balance sheet, except as disclosed in Buyers public filings prior to the date
hereof with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there has not been any
event, occurrence, development or state of circumstances or facts that has had
or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect (for purposes of this sentence only, substituting
"Buyer and its Subsidiaries" for "the Company and the Company Subsidiaries" in
such definition).

 

Section 6.11 _No Vote Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Buyer or the holders of any other
securities of Buyer (equity or otherwise) is necessary to enter into this
Agreement, or to consummate the Purchase and Sale or the Other Transactions.

certain contracts listed on _Schedule 8.01(a)_ that relate to both the
operations or conduct of the Business as well as other businesses of one or
more of Seller and its Subsidiaries but that will remain with Seller and its
Affiliates after the Closing (the " _Shared Contracts_ "). During the Pre-
Closing Period, the parties shall cooperate and shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to obtain the agreement of the
counterparties to each such Shared Contract to enter into a new contract (or
contract amendment, as applicable), effective as of the Closing Date or as
soon thereafter as is reasonably possible, pursuant to which Buyer or its
Affiliate, as applicable, will receive substantially the same goods, services
and intellectual property rights provided to Seller and its Subsidiaries as
of the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Shared Contract (the " _Shared
Contract Rights_ ") on terms and conditions substantially similar to those
contained in the Shared Contract as of the date of this Agreement (each, a "
_Replacement Contract_ ") and (ii) to cause the applicable counterparty to
release Seller and its applicable Subsidiaries from any obligations under the
Shared Contract that become the obligation of Buyer or its Affiliates under
the Replacement Contract.

(b) Except with respect to Shared Contracts, which will be governed solely
by  _Section 8.01(a)_, during the Pre-Closing Period, the parties shall
cooperate and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any consents from any third party required by the terms of a Contract
as a result of the Transactions (" _Required Third Party Consents_ "),
including the consents set forth on _Schedule 8.01(b)_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (i) no
Replacement Contract or Required Third Party Consent shall impose any
Liability on Seller or its Affiliates after the Closing; (ii) neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates shall be required (A) to expend any money with
respect to any Shared Contract, Replacement Contract or Required Third Party
Consent, (B) to remedy any breach under or with respect thereto, or (C) to

(financial or otherwise) to any third party in order to provide Buyer with the
benefits under a Shared Contract, with a Replacement Contract or a Required
Third Party Consent; and (iii) no representation, warranty or covenant of
Seller contained in the Transaction Documents shall be breached, or deemed
breached, no condition shall be deemed not satisfied, and neither Seller nor
any of its Affiliates will have any Liability whatsoever to Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, based on, arising out of or relating to (x) the failure to
obtain any Replacement Contract or Required Third Party Consent,

 



37  (y) any termination of any Shared Contracts or any Contracts for which a
Required Third Party Consent is contemplated by _Section 8.01(b)_ or (z) any
Action commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any person arising out of
or relating to any Shared Contract, the failure to obtain any Replacement
Contract or any Required Third Party Consent or the termination of any Shared
Contract or any Contracts for which a Required Third Party Consent is
contemplated by _Section 8.01(b)_.

Section 8.02 _Cooperation_. For a period of ninety (90) days following the
Closing, Buyer and Seller shall provide reasonable cooperation with each
other, and shall cause their officers, employees, agents, auditors and other
Representatives to provide reasonable cooperation with each other to ensure
the orderly transition of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries from
Seller to Buyer and to minimize any disruption to the respective businesses of
Seller, Buyer, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that might result from
the Transactions. After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Buyer
and Seller shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their
employees, counsel, auditors and other Representatives access, during normal
business hours, to such information and assistance relating to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary for financial
reporting and accounting matters, the preparation and filing of any Tax
Returns, reports or forms or the defense of any Tax claim or assessment. Each
party shall reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in assisting the other pursuant to this _Section 8.02_.
After the Closing, Buyer shall and shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to, provide any assistance reasonably requested by Seller in
connection with the Specified Litigation and any related matters, including
providing reasonable access during normal business hours to the Companys and
the Company Subsidiaries properties, books, contracts, personnel and records
relevant to such matters. Neither party shall be required by this _Section
8.02_ to take any action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
its business or unreasonably disrupt its normal operations (or, in the case
of Buyer, the business or operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries). For the avoidance of doubt, any Buyer Confidential Information
or Seller Confidential Information provided to the requesting party or to
which the requesting party or its Affiliates gain access pursuant to this
_Section 8.02_ shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 8.10_.

 

Section 8.03 _Publicity_. Seller and Buyer agree that, from the date hereof
through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the
Transactions shall be issued by either party without the prior consent of the
other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as such
release or announcement may be required by law or the rules or regulations of
any United States or foreign securities exchange, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance. Seller hereby acknowledges that Buyer will be required to file this
Agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission as "material contracts"
and agrees that it will not object to any such required filing.

 

Section 8.04 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement (including the provisions set forth in  _Section 8.01_ and
_Section 8.05_), each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Closing to occur. Without limiting the foregoing or the provisions set
forth in _Section 8.05_, Buyer and Seller shall use its respective
reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to occur as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof.

for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Other Transaction
Documents. Each of Buyer and Seller shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the
HSR Act. Seller and Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the FTC and the DOJ and shall comply with any such inquiry or request as
promptly as practicable. Each of Seller and Buyer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any clearance required by, and cause the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period under, the HSR Act for the
purchase and sale of the Interest as soon as practicable. Neither Seller nor
Buyer will extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Other Transaction Documents, except
with the prior written consent of the other party hereto. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, and without limitation of the foregoing, if
any objections are asserted under the HSR Act or any other U.S. or foreign
antitrust, merger control or competition law, or any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party,
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Other Transaction Documents as
violative of the HSR Act or any other U.S. or foreign antitrust, merger
control or competition law, each of Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in all
respects with each other and Buyer shall take reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing
in this Agreement requires or shall be deemed to require Buyer to propose,
negotiate, agree or commit to transfer or hold separate or dispose of asses or
businesses if such actions would result in, or would be reasonably likely to
result in, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

Section 8.06 _Records_. (a) As soon as practicable on or after the Closing
Date, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer all material
original agreements, documents, books, records and files, including records
and files stored on computer disks or tapes or any other storage medium
(collectively, " _Records_ "), if any, in the possession of Seller and its
subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) relating to
the business and operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
extent not then in the possession of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, subject to the following exceptions:

Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary for financial reporting and accounting
matters, the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns, reports or forms or

access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Seller, Buyer,
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

currently provide the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with certain
support services including payroll, legal, tax and benefit plan administration

needs the proceeds from the Financing Commitment and has sufficient funds to
consummate the purchase of the Interest and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Other Transaction Documents upon the
terms set forth herein and therein on the Closing Date and (iv) enforce
(including through litigation) its and their rights under the Financing
Commitment.

 



42 (c) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Financing Commitment, Buyer shall
promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, notify Seller and
shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing
from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the purchase
of the Interest and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Other Transaction Documents upon the terms set forth herein and therein
and otherwise on terms not less favorable than the terms and conditions set
forth in the Debt Financing Commitment as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event. Buyer shall deliver to Seller true and complete
copies of all agreements (including any fee letter (subject to
customary redactions)) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall
have committed to provide Buyer with all or any portion of the Financing. In
the event any alternative financing source is required to be obtained, (i) any
reference in this Agreement to the " _Debt Financing_ " or " _Financing_ "
shall include the financing contemplated by the alternate source, (ii) any
reference in this Agreement to the " _Debt Financing Commitment_ " or "
_Financing Commitment_ " shall be deemed to include any commitment letter of
the alternative financing source, (iii) any reference in this Agreement to
"fee letter" shall be deemed to include any fee letter relating to the
alternative financing source and (iv) any reference in this Agreement to the "
_Financing Sources_ " shall refer to the alternative financing sources. Buyer
shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other modification
of, or waive any of its rights under, the Financing Commitment or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing that would (A) add new
conditions precedent or expand any of the conditions precedent set forth
therein as in effect on the date of this Agreement (unless such new or
expanded conditions precedent would not reasonably be expected to materially
impair, materially delay or prevent the availability of all or a portion of
the Financing), (B) reasonably be expected to materially impair, materially
delay or prevent the availability of all or a portion of the Financing, (C)
reduce the aggregate cash amount of the funding commitments under the Debt
Financing Commitment in effect on the date of this Agreement to be funded on
the Closing Date (except as set forth in any "flex provisions" in the Debt
Financing Commitment and, to the extent resulting from an increase in the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount, if any revolving
facility or increased term loan is available to satisfy such amounts or
original issue discount), or (D) otherwise adversely affect in any material
respect the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the other parties
to the Debt Financing Commitment or materially delay the Closing
(collectively, the " _Restricted Commitment Letter Amendments_ ") ( _provided_
, that subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 8.08(c)_, Buyer
may amend the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
commitment letter as of the date of this Agreement (but not to make any other
changes except as permitted under this _Section 8.08(c)_, but only if the
addition of such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would
not result in the occurrence of a Restricted Commitment Letter Amendment).
Buyer shall promptly deliver to Seller true, complete and correct copies of
any amendment, modification or replacement of the Debt Financing Commitment.
Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably apprised of material adverse developments
relating to the Financing, including any material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to the Debt Financing Commitment with respect to
the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be
funded at Closing (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary 

 



43  course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Financing and/or the
definitive documentation related thereto), including upon its becoming aware
of any breach of the Debt Financing Commitment by any party thereto. For the
avoidance of doubt, failure to obtain all or any portion of the Financing (or
any alternative financing) shall not in and of itself relieve or alter the
obligations of Buyer to consummate the purchase and sale of the Interest and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Other
Transaction Documents upon the terms set forth herein and therein (such
obligation being subject only to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in  _Section 3.01(a)_).

(d) In connection with any Securities Offering, the Seller agrees to cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to (i) provide reasonable cooperation to
the Buyer in connection with the Securities Offering, including permitting the
Buyer to include in the offering documents the financial statements referred
to in _Section 4.07_ and  _Section 5.03_ and other information about the
Company and Company Subsidiaries typically included in public equity offering
prospectuses (excluding any "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" or similar
section) and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining
accountants comfort letters as required for the Securities Offering, at
Buyers expense, and any consents required to include any financial statements
in the offering materials for the Securities Offering or otherwise in the
Buyers SEC filings, at Buyers expense. For the avoidance of doubt, failure
to consummate a Securities Offering shall not in and of itself relieve or
alter the obligations of Buyer to consummate the purchase and sale of the
Interest and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Other Transaction Documents upon the terms set forth herein and therein (such
obligation being subject only to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in _Section 3.01(a)_).

Section 8.09 _Certain Matters_. Seller and Buyer agree to the provisions set
forth on Section 8.09 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

Section 8.10 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing_. Each of the parties acknowledges that the information being
provided to it in connection with Transactions is subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference; _provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreement and this _Section
8.10(a)_ will not prohibit any disclosure of information permitted by
_Section 8.08_. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating
solely to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; _provided_ that Buyer
acknowledges that any and all other information provided to it by or on
behalf of Seller or Sellers Representatives concerning Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) shall remain
subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after
the Closing Date.

(b) _Post-Closing_.

 



     | (i) |

Buyer acknowledges that, in the course of its and its Affiliates investigation
of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Business and the Assets owned
by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, Buyer and its Representatives
have become aware of Seller Confidential 

---|---|--- 
 



44 Information, or communication of such Seller Confidential Information to third
parties, in each case, other than after the Closing and any Seller
Confidential Information used in the Business, could be detrimental to Seller
or its Affiliates. Buyer covenants that for the seven (7) year period
following the Closing Date, it shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
and Representatives to, maintain in confidence and not disclose or use such
Seller Confidential Information without Sellers prior written consent. If
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Representatives are requested or required
(as by subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose
any such Seller Confidential Information, Buyer will promptly notify Seller in
order to permit Seller to seek a protective order or take other appropriate
action. In such circumstances, Buyer will participate in Sellers efforts to
obtain a protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such Seller Confidential Information. If, in the
absence of a protective order, Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives are, in the opinion of Buyers counsel, compelled as a matter
of law to disclose such Seller Confidential Information, then Buyer or such
Affiliate or Representative may disclose to the party compelling disclosure
or as it orders only that part of such Seller Confidential Information as is
required by Applicable Law to be disclosed and will use reasonable efforts to
obtain confidential treatment therefor. Upon Sellers request, Buyer
will return and cause its Affiliates and Representatives to return to Seller
all such Seller Confidential Information provided by or on behalf of Seller
and destroy all Seller Confidential Information prepared by Buyer or its
Affiliates or Representatives. 
---|--- 



     | (ii) |

Seller acknowledges that, in the course of Buyers and its Affiliates
investigation of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Business and the
Assets owned by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and Sellers
ownership of the Company and the Company Subsidiary, Seller and its
Representatives have become aware of Buyer Confidential Information, and that
its use of such Buyer Confidential Information, or communication of such
Buyer Confidential Information to third parties could be detrimental to Buyer
or its Affiliates. Seller covenants that for the seven (7) year period
following the Closing Date, it shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, maintain in confidence and not disclose or use such Buyer
Confidential Information without Buyers prior written consent. If Seller or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives are requested or required (as by
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any such
Buyer Confidential Information, Seller will promptly notify Buyer in order to
permit Buyer to seek a protective order or take other appropriate action.
In such circumstances, Seller will participate in Buyers efforts to obtain a
protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded such Buyer Confidential Information. If, in the absence of a
protective order, Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives are, in
the opinion 

---|---|--- 
 



45 such Buyer Confidential Information, then Seller or such Affiliate or
Representative may disclose to the party compelling disclosure or as it
orders only that part of such Buyer Confidential Information as is required by
Applicable Law to be disclosed and will use reasonable efforts to obtain
confidential treatment therefor. Upon Buyers request, Seller will return and
cause its Affiliates and Representatives to return to Buyer all such Buyer
Confidential Information provided by or on behalf of Buyer and destroy all
Buyer Confidential Information prepared by Seller or its Affiliates or
Representatives. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller
shall be permitted to disclose such information as is necessary in their
reasonable assessment with respect to the Specified Litigation; _provided_ ,
that prior to the disclosure of any Buyer Confidential Information in
connection therewith, Seller shall, to the extent legally permissible, notify
Buyer promptly so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or take
any other appropriate action. 
---|--- 
 

Section 8.11 _Non-solicitation_.

 

(a) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the eighteen
(18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "),
Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, solicit for hire or hire any person who is or was employed by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries at Closing other than purely
administrative personnel that are not in any managerial role, or solicit any
such employee to leave such employment, except pursuant to a general
solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such employees; 
_provided _,_ that_ nothing in this _Section 8.11(a)_ shall prevent Seller or
any of its subsidiaries from hiring (i) any employee whose employment has been
terminated by Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (ii) after six
(6) months from the date of termination of employment, any employee whose
employment has been terminated by the employee.

 

(b) This _Section 8.11_ shall cease to apply to any Person at such time as it
is no longer a subsidiary of Seller and shall not apply to any person that
purchases Assets, operations or a business from a Seller or its subsidiaries
if such person is not a subsidiary of Seller after the consummation of such
transaction.

 

(c) If a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision
of this _Section 8.11_ is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree
that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability will
have the power to and shall reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, and/or to replace any invalid
or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so
modified. 

Section 8.12 _Post-Closing Receipts_. If, after the Closing Date, either party
or its Affiliates receives any funds belonging to another party or its
Affiliates in accordance with the terms of any Transaction Document, the
receiving party will, or will cause its Affiliates

 



46  to, promptly advise the other party or its applicable Affiliate, will
segregate and hold such funds in trust for the benefit of the other party or
its Affiliates and will promptly deliver such funds, together with any
interest earned thereon, to an account or accounts designated in writing by
such other party or its Affiliates.

 

Section 8.13 _Insurance Coverage_. From and after the Closing, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries shall cease to be insured by Sellers insurance
policies or by any of its self-insurance programs and Seller shall retain all
rights to control such insurance policies and self-insurance programs,
including the right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy back
or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of its insurance policies
and self-insurance programs. The parties acknowledge that the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and the Business may be entitled to the benefit of
coverage under the insurance policies made available through Seller as
described on _Section 8.13_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to the extent
such policies are in existence at the Closing (the " _Retained Policies_ "),
in each case with respect to acts, facts, circumstances or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing (" _Pre-Closing Occurrences_"). For a period of
twenty (20) months after the Closing, Buyer may report to Seller any and all
Pre-Closing Occurrences arising in connection with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or the Business to the applicable insurance providers to the
extent permitted under the Retained Policies (" _Retained Policy Claims_ ").
Seller shall consider in good faith such Retained Policy Claims, and if in the
good faith judgment of Seller the submission of such Retained Policy Claims
would not be harmful to Seller or its subsidiaries or their
businesses, Seller shall submit such Retained Policy Claims to the insurer;
_provided_ that, (a) Buyer shall be fully liable for all uninsured or self-
insured amounts in respect of any Retained Policy Claims, and (b) Buyer agrees
to reimburse Seller promptly upon request for all out-of-pocket costs or
expenses incurred by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller in connection with
making or pursuing any claim pursuant to this _Section 8.13_, including the
costs of filing a claim and any deductibles, premium increases or other
amounts that are or become payable by such other party or any Affiliate of
such other party under the applicable insurance policies or self-insurance
programs as a result of claims made pursuant to this  _Section 8.13_ (such
costs and expenses referred to in this clause (b), " _Recovery Costs_ "). With
respect to Pre-Closing Occurrences, Seller (with respect to the Retained
Policies) shall be under no obligation to continue to maintain such Retained
Policies if Seller determines in good faith that the interests of Seller, its
subsidiaries and its businesses would be better served by not continuing such
policies. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.13_ to the contrary,
this _Section 8.13_ shall be subject in all respects to the terms of Sellers
insurance policies, and to the extent such insurance policies do not permit
any of the matters described in this _Section 8.13_, then Seller shall be
under no obligation to Buyer with respect to such matters.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _Employee and Related Matters_

 

Section 9.01 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that it shall ensure that each employee of Seller, the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries who continues employment with Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates after the
Closing Date (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall be

 



47  provided with, for a period extending until the earlier of the termination
of such Continuing Employees employment with such entities or twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date, with compensation and benefits (excluding
equity awards) that are substantially, in the aggregate, equal to the
compensation and benefits provided by Seller, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the date of
this Agreement; _provided_ that nothing herein shall preclude Buyer, the
Company or Company Subsidiaries from changing the terms and conditions of
employment (subject to the foregoing requirement to provide substantially
equal compensation and benefits to each Continuing Employee for the period
described above) or terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee at
any time following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Agreement shall be interpreted as (i) prohibiting Buyer from converting
the employee benefits offered to the Continuing Employees at any time during
the aforementioned period to employee benefits offered by Buyer to comparably
situated employees of Buyer and its affiliates, (ii) prohibiting the
termination of any employee benefits being offered to the Continuing Employees
by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (if any) which are not being
offered by Buyer to comparably situated employees of Buyer and its
affiliates, or (iii) conferring, or intending to confer, on any employee of
Seller, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries a right to continued
employment with Buyer or any of its affiliates following the Closing. For
clarity, Buyer has the right to modify or terminate the employment or terms
of employment of any Continuing Employee, including the right to amend or
terminate any employee benefits or compensation plan, program or arrangement,
after the Closing Date (subject to the foregoing requirement to provide
substantially equal compensation and benefits to each Continuing Employee for
the period described above).

 

(b) Seller agrees to waive any non-competition, non-solicitation, and any
other restrictive covenants as to any Continuing Employee as of the Closing
Date.

(c) Buyer shall ensure that, as of the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee
receives full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to participate,
vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits, but excluding benefit
accrual) for service with Seller, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (or
predecessor employers to the extent Seller, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary provides such past service credit under its employee benefit
plans), to the extent adequately disclosed by Seller to Buyer on the date of
this Agreement, under each of the comparable employee benefit plans, programs
and policies of Buyer, the Company or the relevant subsidiary, as applicable,
in which such Continuing Employee becomes a participant; provided, however,
that no such service recognition shall result in any duplication of benefits.
As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company or relevant
subsidiary to, credit to Continuing Employee the amount of vacation time that
such employees had accrued under any applicable Company Benefit Plan as of the
Closing Date. With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained
by Buyer, the Company or the relevant subsidiary for the benefit of any
Continuing Employees, subject only to any required approval of the applicable
insurance provider, if any, Buyer shall (i) cause to be waived any
eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the
application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan, and
(ii) to the extent permitted by the plan, cause each Continuing Employee
to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing
Employee under any similar Company Benefit Plan for the plan year that
includes the Closing Date for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments
and out-of-pocket 

 



48  maximums, to the extent adequately disclosed by Seller to Buyer on the date
of this Agreement, as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the applicable plan maintained by Buyer, the Company
or the relevant subsidiary, as applicable, for the plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs.

(d) Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and any of the Company
Subsidiaries) shall be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold
Buyer and its Affiliates harmless from and against, any obligations or losses
relating to provision of continuation coverage, and all related notices,
under any group health plan maintained or formerly maintained by Seller or its
Affiliates to or in respect of all current and former employees of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, and their beneficiaries for whom a qualifying
event occurs prior to, on or after the Closing Date, except that Buyer and its
Affiliates shall be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold
Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and against, any obligations or
losses relating to provision of continuation coverage, and all related
notices, under any group health plan maintained or formerly maintained by
Buyer or its Affiliates to or in respect of all Continuing Employees and
their beneficiaries for whom a qualifying event occurs after the Closing
Date. The terms "group health plan," "continuation coverage," and "qualifying
event" are used herein with the meanings ascribed to them in Section 4980B of
the Code and Sections 601 - 609 of ERISA.

(e) Seller shall take such action as is necessary to provide that
all Continuing Employees who are participants in the Seller 401(k) Plan (the
" _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") have a fully vested and nonforfeitable interest in
their entire respective account balances under such plan as of the Closing
Date (regardless of their years of vesting credit under the Seller 401(k)
Plan). On or prior to the Closing Date, with respect to all Company employees,
Seller shall contribute all contributions to the Seller 401(k) Plan (i) which
are required to be made through the last complete pay period prior to the
Closing Date under the Seller 401(k) Plan, and (ii) which relate to service or
employee salary deferral contributions through the last complete pay period
prior to the Closing Date, whether or not required to be made on or prior to
the Closing Date under the Seller 401(k) Plan.

(f) Except as set forth in  _Section 9.01(f)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and any Company
Subsidiary) shall retain all liabilities with respect to the Company Benefit
Plans, including for any claims made thereunder before, on or after the
Closing Date and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall assume any such
liabilities or have any obligation to contribute to, or adopt as a
participating company in, any Company Benefit Plan. Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Company and any Company Subsidiary) shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer, the Company and their respective Affiliates from and against,
any and all Losses arising out of, or relating to, any Company Benefit Plan.
No provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Continuing Employee, or any beneficiary or dependents thereof,
or (ii) be construed as in any way modifying or amending the provisions of any
Company Benefit Plan.

(g) In order to provide information to Buyer sufficient to enable it to be
prepared to perform its obligations under this  _Section 9.01_ beginning at
the Closing, Seller agrees that between the date of the Agreement and the
Closing it will cause its human resources personnel to confer with Buyers
personnel and provide information to Buyer relating to the Continuing
Employees and their compensation and benefits as reasonably requested by
Buyer.

 



49 Section 9.02 _Assumption of Continuing Employee Equity Awards_. Effective as
of the Closing Date, each then non-vested, outstanding and unpaid award of
"restricted stock units" held by a Continuing Employee (each, a " _Seller RSU
Award_ ") shall terminate in accordance with its terms and Buyer shall
grant each Continuing Employee an award of restricted stock units with
respect to a number of shares of Buyers common stock (rounded to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of the number of shares of Sellers common
stock subject to such Seller RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Equity Exchange Ratio. Such award shall be subject to
terms and conditions provided under Buyers applicable equity plan, with
vesting over a four (4) year period commencing on the Effective Time. For
purposes hereof, " _Equity Exchange Ratio_ " means the quotient obtained by
dividing (x) the volume weighted average trading price of Sellers common
stock for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on the trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, by (y) the volume weighted average
trading price of Buyers common stock for the twenty (20) consecutive trading
days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date. Buyer
agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form)
with respect to the shares of Buyer common stock issuable with respect to the
new awards granted by Buyer as provided in this _Section 9.02_ to the extent
required under Applicable Law in order to register the shares of Buyer common
stock issuable pursuant to such awards, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so
long as such awards remain outstanding. As promptly as practicable following
the date the date of this Agreement, Seller will deliver a list for each of
the Seller RSU Awards referred to in this  _Section 9.02_, the recipient,
the number of Seller shares covered by the applicable Seller RSU Award and the
portion that is unvested as of the date of this Agreement.

 _Further Assurances_

 

Section 10.01 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested
by either party hereto, the other party shall execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall
take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions (subject to the
provisions of _Sections 8.01_ , _8.04_ and _8.05_ ), as such other party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, but no such action will require any party to
waive rights under this Agreement or any Other Transaction Documents.

 

ARTICLE XI

 

 _Indemnification_

 

Section 11.01 _Tax Indemnification_.

 

(a) After the Closing, Seller shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) and each of
their respective officers, directors,

 



50  employees, stockholders, agents and representatives and hold them harmless

for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) any liability arising from any breach of
any representation or warranty of Seller in _Section 4.08_ of this Agreement,

the foregoing, Seller shall not indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and
agents, from any liability for Taxes attributable to any action taken after
the Closing by Buyer, any of its Affiliates (including the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries), or any transferee of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(other than any such action expressly required by Applicable Law or by this
Agreement and any such action taken on the Closing Date in the ordinary course
of business) (a " _Buyer Tax Act_ ") or attributable to a breach by Buyer of
its obligations under this Agreement.

(b) After the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to, indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and
representatives and hold them harmless from (i) all liability for Taxes of or
attributable to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any taxable
period ending after the Closing Date (except to the extent of any Straddle
Period, in which case Buyers indemnity will cover only that portion of any
such Taxes that are for the portion of any such Straddle Period that is after
the Closing Date, (ii) all liability for Taxes in _Section 12.04_ of this
Agreement, and (iii) all liability for Taxes attributable to a Buyer Tax Act
or to a breach by Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement.

(c) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "):



     | (i) | real, personal and intangible property and other ad valorem
Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ") of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such
Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are
in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the Straddle Period; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(other than Property Taxes) allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 
 



51 Section 11.02 _Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made in this Agreement (in each case other than the
representations and warranties relating to Taxes) shall survive the Closing
solely for purposes of _Section 11.03_ , _Section 11.04_ and _Section
15.04_ and shall terminate at the close of business on the date that is

or on the Closing shall survive until sixteen (16) months (but in no event
past August 15, 2017) following the date on which such covenant is to be fully
and finally performed and (ii) for which performance is required after the
Closing shall survive until three (3) years following the date on which such
covenant is to be fully and finally performed. Any claim for indemnification
pursuant to this _Article XI_ that is made in accordance with the
requirements of this  _Article XI_ prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period set forth in this _Section 11.02_ with respect to such claim
shall survive, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article XI_,

then only to the extent of any such excess; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the liability of Seller under _Section 11.03(a)(i)_, together

(c) No Losses under _Section 11.04(a)(ii)_ shall be subject to the Deductible

with respect to Buyer Fundamental Representations, shall not exceed the
Fundamental Representations Cap referred to above.

 

Section 11.05 _Limitations on Indemnification; Cooperation_.

 

(a) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving
any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated to
indemnify the other party hereunder including by making commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability.

 

(b) Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledges and agrees that, (i) other than the
representations and warranties of Buyer or Seller specifically contained in
this Agreement or the Other Transaction Documents, there are no
representations or warranties of Buyer or Seller either expressed or implied
with respect to the Transactions, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or
their respective Assets, liabilities and business, and neither Buyer nor
Seller has relied on any representations or warranties other than those
specifically set forth in this Agreement or the Other Transaction Documents
and (ii) it shall have no claim or right to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 11.03_ or _Section 11.04_ with respect to any information,
documents or materials furnished by Buyer or Seller or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents or advisors to the other party, including any
information, documents or material made available to a party in certain "data
rooms", management presentations or any other form in expectation of the
Transactions except as expressly set forth herein. Each of Buyer and Seller
also acknowledges and agrees that in connection with the Transactions, it has
received certain estimates, projections, forecasts and similar forward-looking
statements relating to the future operating and financial performance of the
other party (including, as to Seller, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) and no representation or warranty is being made by or on behalf
of either party with respect to such matters except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement.

(c) No party shall have any right to indemnification under this _Article XI_
with respect to any Losses to the extent (and only to the extent) such Losses
(i) arise out of any action taken by or omitted to be taken by such party;
(ii) arise solely out of changes after the Closing Date in Applicable Law or
interpretations or applications thereof; or (iii) are duplicative of Losses
that have previously been recovered hereunder. No indemnified party shall have
any right to assert any claim against any indemnifying party with respect to
any Loss, cause of action or other claim to the extent such Loss is a Loss,
cause of action or claim with respect to which such indemnified party or any
of its Affiliates has taken action (or caused action to be taken) with the
primary intent of accelerating the time period in which such matter
is asserted or payable in order to cause a claim to be made prior to the
applicable expiration date set forth in _Section 11.07_.

 



54 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Losses_ " means all losses, damages,
costs, expenses, and Liabilities actually suffered or incurred or paid
(including reasonable attorneys fees) including the reasonable costs of
mitigation or pursuing recovery under third party indemnification agreements
or insurance policies, but Losses will not include any punitive or
consequential or special damages or Losses in the form of a diminution in
value of the Business; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not limit punitive,
consequential or special damages or Losses in the form of a diminution in
value of the Business required to be paid to a third party by order of a
Governmental Entity. In no event shall either party have any Liability under
this Agreement (including under this _Article XI_ ) for (a) any types of
damages not included in the definition of "Losses" or (b) the amount that is a
possible or Loss that the indemnified party believes may be asserted by a
third party but has not yet been asserted by a third party.

 

Section 11.06 _Losses Net of Insurance, etc_. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this  _Article XI_ shall be net of any
amounts recovered by the indemnified party under insurance policies with
respect to Loss. If any indemnified party or any of its Affiliates is at any
time entitled to recover under an insurance policy any amount in respect of
any matter giving rise to a Loss pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
XI_ , as applicable, the indemnified party shall (and shall cause its
applicable Affiliates to) take commercially reasonable steps to pursue
such recovery. If any indemnified parties recover any amounts in respect of
Losses pursuant to the provisions of this _Article XI_ under any insurance
policy at any time after the indemnifying party has paid all or a portion of
such Losses to such indemnified parties pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article XI_ , Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall, or shall cause such
indemnified party to, promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days
after receipt) pay over to the indemnifying party the amount so received (to
the extent previously paid by the indemnifying party) net of any costs of
recovery not reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. In no event shall recovery
of any insurance proceeds or any failure by an indemnified party to seek
recovery pursuant to any insurance policy be a condition to such indemnified
partys right to indemnification pursuant to this _Article XI_. Any indemnity
payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless a final determination (which shall
include the execution of a Form 870 AD or successor form) with respect to the
indemnified party or any of its Affiliates causes any such payment not to
be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for United States federal
income Tax purposes.

Section 11.07 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless a party hereto (a) pursuant to _Section 11.01_, shall
terminate sixty (60) days after the applicable statutes of limitations with
respect to the Tax liabilities in question expire (giving effect to any
extension thereof) and (b) pursuant to _Sections 11.03(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ and
_11.04(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ shall terminate when the applicable representation
or warranty or covenant terminates pursuant to _Section 11.02_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that as to clauses (a) and (b) above such obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which
the person to be indemnified or the related party thereto shall have, before
the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering
a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim)
to the indemnifying party.

 



55 Section 11.08 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) In order for a party (the " _indemnified party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement (other than indemnification
for a Tax Claim under _Section 11.01_ which shall be governed by _Section
11.10_) in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by a
third party against the indemnified party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing
(which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the events giving rise to
such Third Party Claim), of the Third Party Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party is actually
prejudiced by such failure (except that the indemnifying party shall not be
liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the indemnified
party failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the indemnified party shall
deliver to the indemnifying party, promptly after the indemnified
partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim.

 

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof
with counsel with sufficient competence in such matters selected by the
indemnifying party reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party so long as
(i) the Third Party Claim principally involves money damages and does not
principally seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the
indemnified party and (ii) the Third Party Claim does not relate to or
otherwise arise in connection with any criminal laws or regulatory enforcement
action. Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the
indemnified party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified
party in connection with the defense thereof. If the indemnifying party
assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel (not reasonably
objected to by the indemnifying party), at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the
indemnifying party shall control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be
liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party
for any period during which the indemnifying party has failed to assume the
defense thereof.

(c) If the indemnifying party so elects to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim, (i) it shall pursue such defense until the Third Party
Claim has been resolved and (ii) all of the indemnified parties shall
cooperate with the indemnifying party at the indemnifying partys expense in
the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the indemnifying partys request) the provision to the
indemnifying party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The indemnifying party shall be authorized to
consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
Third Party Claim, subject to the prior written consent of the indemnified
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ , that such consent shall be deemed reasonably withheld
if (A) such settlement requires a payment to be made to the counterparty in
such Third Party Claim and does not provide that the indemnifying party agrees
to pay such settlement (subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article
XI_ ) or (B) such settlement or consent

 



56  results in the finding or admission of any violation of criminal laws or any
other admission of criminal wrongdoing on the part of the indemnified party.
Whether or not the indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without
the indemnifying partys prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that such consent
shall be deemed reasonably withheld if such settlement or consent results in
the finding or admission of any violation of criminal laws or any other
admission of criminal wrongdoing on the part of the indemnifying party.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this  _Article XI_ shall
not address the Specified Litigation, and the Specified Litigation shall be
exclusively governed by the Specified Agreement.

 

Section 11.09 _Procedures Related to Indemnification for Other Claims (Other
than Tax Claims under Section 11.01)_. In the event any indemnified party
should have a claim against any indemnifying party under _Section 11.03_ or
_11.04_ that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or
sought to be collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party
shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the
indemnifying party. The failure by any indemnified party so to notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability
which it may have to such indemnified party under _Section 11.03_ or
_Section 11.04_, except to the extent that the indemnifying party
demonstrates that it has been prejudiced by such failure.

 

Section 11.10 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims_.

 

(a) If a claim shall be made by any taxing authority, which, if successful
might result in an indemnity payment to Buyer pursuant to  _Section 11.01_
(a " _Tax Claim_ ") to the party receiving notice of such Tax Claim, such
party shall promptly notify the other party of such Tax Claim in writing and
in reasonable detail. If notice of a Tax Claim is not given to such other
party within fifteen (15) days, such other party shall not be liable in
respect of such Tax Claim to the extent that such other partys position is
actually prejudiced as a result thereof. With respect to any Tax
Claim relating to a taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date,
Seller shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim
(including selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may
pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings
and conferences with any taxing authority with respect thereto, and may either
pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where Applicable Law permits such
refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to any such Tax Claim that could potentially
affect Tax liabilities of Buyer or the Company or the Company Subsidiaries for
any Post-Closing Tax Period, Seller will keep Buyer informed of all material
developments and events.

(b) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a taxable period that ends after
the Closing Date (including any Straddle Period), Buyer shall control all
proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of
counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing
authority with respect thereto, and may either pay the Tax claimed

 



57  and sue for a refund where Applicable Law permits such refund suits or
contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; _provided_ , _however_ , that
with respect to any such Tax Claim that could potentially affect Tax
liabilities of Seller or the Company or the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, Buyer will keep Seller informed of all material
developments and events.

 

(c) Buyer and the Company and each of their respective Affiliates shall
cooperate in contesting any Tax Claim, which cooperation shall include,
without limitation, the retention and (upon request) the provision to the
other party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such
Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information or explanation of any material provided
hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

 

Section 11.11 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement, each of Buyer and Seller further acknowledges and agrees
that, should the Closing occur, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all claims relating to this Agreement, the Transactions, the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Assets, liabilities
and businesses (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from or
fraud) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
_Article XI_ except that any claims arising under the TSAs and the License
will be governed by the terms of those agreements and will not be subject to
the provisions of this _Article XI_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of
Buyer and Seller hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under Applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) it
or its Affiliates may have against the other party or its Affiliates arising
under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign statute, law,
ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise (except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article XI_ , the provisions of
Article II and pursuant to the Mutual Release, TSAs and License). 

ARTICLE XII

 

 _Tax Matters_

 

Section 12.01 _Responsibility for Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns and
Amendments_.

 

(a) Seller shall timely prepare and file all Tax Returns with respect to which
the Company or Company Subsidiaries file a consolidated, combined or unitary
Tax Return with Seller with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date. All other Tax Returns of the
Company or Company Subsidiaries shall be prepared, or caused to be prepared,
by Buyer.

(b) Buyer and its Affiliates shall not, without the prior written consent of
Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), amend
any Tax Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

 



58 Section 12.02 _Cooperation_. Each of Seller, the Company and Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers,
employees, agents, auditors and other Representatives reasonably to cooperate,
in preparing and filing all Tax Returns, including maintaining and making
available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes and in
resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating
to Taxes. Buyer and Seller recognize that Seller and its Affiliates may need
access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and
Tax records and information held by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to the extent such records and information pertain to events occurring prior
to the Closing Date; therefore, Buyer agrees, and agrees to cause the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, (a) to use their respective best efforts to
properly retain and maintain such records until such time as Seller agrees
that such retention and maintenance is no longer necessary, and (b) to allow
Seller and its agents and Representatives (and agents or Representatives of
any of its Affiliates), at times and dates mutually acceptable to the parties,
to inspect, review and make copies of such records as Seller may
deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such activities to be
conducted during normal business hours.

Section 12.03 _Refunds and Credits_. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
for the account of Seller _provided_ , _however_ , that there will be no
payment obligation under this  _Section 12.03_ for any Tax refund or credit
that results from a carryback or other use in a Pre-Closing Tax Period of a
Tax item attributable to or arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall
cause the Company to forward to Seller any such refund within ten (10) days
after the refund is received (or reimburse Seller for any such credit within
ten (10) days after any such credit is applied against other Tax liability).
Seller and Buyer shall treat any payments under the preceding sentence that
Seller shall receive pursuant to this _Section 12.03_ as an adjustment to the
gross purchase price as determined for federal income Tax purposes, except as
otherwise required by Applicable Law.

 

Section 12.04 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, value
added, registration and other such Taxes (including all applicable real
estate transfer or gains Taxes) and related fees (including any penalties,
interest and additions to Tax) incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Seller, on the
one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer, on the other hand. Buyer shall
file all appropriate Tax Returns as may be required with respect to such
Taxes. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in timely making all Tax Returns as
may be required to be filed in the preceding sentence.

Section 12.05 _Buyer Activity Post Closing_. Buyer shall not, with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, take a position with respect to Taxes of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that would have the effect of
shifting income to a Pre-Closing Tax Period unless, in each case, Seller shall
have consented in writing to such action by Buyer. Buyer shall not file any
elections under Section 338 of the Code.

Section 12.06 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The gross purchase price as
determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall be allocated among the
shares of the Significant Company Subsidiaries and the other assets of the
Company in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated. Within sixty (60) days after the determination of the
adjustments, if any, to the Purchase Price under this

 



59  Agreement, Buyer will provide to Seller its proposed allocation of the
purchase price (the " _Allocation_ "). Within thirty (30) days after the
receipt of such Allocation, Seller will submit to Buyer in writing any
proposed changes to such Allocation or shall indicate its concurrence
therewith, which concurrence shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed (and in the event no such changes are proposed in writing to Buyer
within such period of time, Seller will be deemed to have agreed to, and
accepted, the Allocation). Buyer and Seller will endeavor in good faith to
resolve any differences with respect to the Allocation within fifteen (15)
days after Buyers receipt of written notice of objection from Seller. Any
unresolved disputes will be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, the
costs of which shall be borne by Seller on the one hand and Buyer on the
other hand in proportion to the percentage of the total dollar amount of the
items submitted for dispute that are resolved in Buyers or Sellers favor,
respectively. The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
binding on Buyer and Seller. All Tax Returns and reports filed by Buyer, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries will be prepared consistently with the
Allocation. None of Buyer, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or Seller
shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the Allocation unless required to do so under Applicable Law
pursuant to a determination (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code
or analogous provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law). Seller and Buyer
agree that they will timely file Form 8594 (and any applicable state or local
forms) by attaching such form to their respective timely filed U.S. federal
income Tax Returns and otherwise in a manner reflecting the Allocation, and
Seller and Buyer will cooperate with each other in connection with such
preparation and filing. The parties shall further cooperate in updating the
Allocation and Form 8594 (and any applicable state or local forms) with
respect to any post-Closing adjustments to the purchase price as determined
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (including under _Section 11.06_).

 

Section 12.07 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Except to the extent otherwise
required by Applicable Law, Seller and Buyer shall treat any and all payments
under this Article XII, Section 2.05, and Article XI as an adjustment to
purchase price for Tax purposes.

Seller or Buyer pursuant to _Section 13.01_, the party desiring to terminate
this Agreement shall give written notice thereof to the other party and this

15.03_ relating to certain expenses, (c) _Section 15.04_ relating to the
parties rights to seek and obtain specific performance, and (d) this _Article

75 Section 15.08 _Interpretation; Exhibits and the Seller Disclosure Schedule_.
The headings contained in this Agreement, in the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
in any Exhibit or Schedule hereto and in the table of contents to this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Each Schedule of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to incorporate by reference all
information disclosed in any other Schedule of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
to the extent it is reasonably apparent that such information is relevant to
such other Section or subsection, upon a reading of the disclosure that the
disclosure of such matter is applicable to such Schedule of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule. The Seller Disclosure Schedule and all Exhibits
and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in
and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Each party
has participated in the drafting of this Agreement and there shall be no
presumption of construing ambiguity against the drafting person of this
Agreement or any provision hereof. Any capitalized terms used in the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or any Exhibit or Schedule annexed hereto but not
otherwise defined therein, shall have the meaning as defined in this
Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the word "or" shall not be exclusive.
The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning as the word
"shall". The phrase "to the extent" shall mean the extent or degree to which
a subject or thing extends, and shall not simply be construed to mean the word
"if".

 

Section 15.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed
by each of the parties and delivered to the other party. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
or scanned pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart to this Agreement.

Section 15.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits and
schedules), the Other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement
contain the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings relating to such subject matter.

Section 15.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement (or any
portion thereof) or the application of any such provision (or any portion
thereof) to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision hereof (or the remaining portion thereof) or the application of such
provision to any other persons or circumstances. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity declares that
any term or provision hereof is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties
agree that the court making such determination will have the power to reduce
the scope, duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, illegal or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid, legal
and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision.

 



76 Section 15.12 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Non-Assertion
of Attorney-Client Privilege_.

(a) Buyer hereby waives and agrees not to assert, and agrees, after Closing,
to cause the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries to waive and to not
assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the
representation (the " _Current Representation_ "), after the Closing (the "
_Post-Closing Representation_ "), of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any
of their respective officers, directors or employees in any matter involving
this Agreement or any other agreements or Transactions, by OMelveny and Myers
LLP (" _OMM_ ").

(b) Buyer hereby waives and agrees to not assert, and each agrees, after
Closing, to cause the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries to waive
and to not assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between OMM and Seller, its Affiliates, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors or employees
occurring during the Current Representation in connection with any Post-
Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute with Buyer, and
after the Closing, with any of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, it
being the intention of the parties hereto that all such rights to such
attorney-client privilege and to control such attorney-client privilege shall
be retained by Seller; _provided_ that the foregoing waiver and
acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any communication not
involving this Agreement or any other agreements or Transactions, or to
communications with any person other than such persons and their advisers.

 

Section 15.13 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a)
expressly and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of
the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within
the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any United States federal court located in the State of Delaware or
any Delaware state court) in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any of the Transactions, (b) agrees that it will not attempt
to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any such court, and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any United States
federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court);
_provided_ , that each of the parties shall have the right to bring any action
or proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered any United States federal
court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court in any
other court or jurisdiction. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of
process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this
first paragraph of _Section 15.13_ in any such action or proceeding in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions by mailing copies thereof
by registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested,
to its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 15.07_. However, the
foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on
the other party by any other legally available method. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 15.13_, _Section 15.14_, or _Section
15.15_, and without limiting the provisions of _Section 15.16_, each of the
parties hereto (i) agrees that it will not, and will not permit its respective
Affiliates to, bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity and whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources in any way related to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any dispute arising
out of or relating to the Financing or the performance thereof) in any forum

 



77  other than the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York or the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, located
in the Borough of Manhattan or, in either case, any appellate court thereof,
(ii) agrees that any such action will be governed by the laws of the State of
New York (except as otherwise set forth in the Commitment Letter), (iii)
agrees to waive and hereby waives, irrevocably and unconditionally, any right
to a trial by jury in any such action and (iv) agrees to waive and hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which such party
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court.

Section 15.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE
DEBT FINANCING UNDER THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENT). EACH PARTY HERETO (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 15.14_.

Section 15.15 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE,
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW RULES THAT WOULD CAUSE THE
APPLICATION OF LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THOSE OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, EACH OF THE PARTIES AGREES THAT THE
INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE
PERFORMED IN SUCH STATE SHALL APPLY TO ANY ACTION BROUGHT AGAINST THE
FINANCING SOURCES.

 

Section 15.16 _Liability of Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the Company, the Seller and its Affiliates
each agrees that it will not have any rights or claims against any Financing
Source (in their capacity as such) or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives in connection
with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 15.16_ shall not prevent Seller
from enforcing its rights under the Transaction Documents against Buyer so as
to cause Buyer to enforce its rights under any of its agreements with any
Financing Source.
