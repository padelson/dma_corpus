Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to _Section_ __ _

or suitability of any product sold or distributed prior to the Closing by, or

(vi) any Legacy Liability; and

(vii) any Cardiff Liability.

 

In addition, Buyer is not assuming or agreeing to pay or discharge any Section
75 Liability arising out of the Transaction, whether the same shall
arise prior to, on or following the Closing Date, which Section 75 Liability
shall constitute Excluded Liabilities for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.02. _Assignment of Certain Transferred Assets_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any
Transferred Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment or transfer thereof, without
the consent of a third party (including any Government Authority), would
constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or a violation of Law.
Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.05_, Seller shall, and
shall cause each of the other Seller Parties to, use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any consent necessary for the transfer or assignment
of any such Transferred Asset, claim, right or benefit to Buyer.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Seller Party, nor any of
their Subsidiaries, shall be required to compensate any third party, commence
or participate in any Action or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise, including any accommodation or arrangement to indemnify, remain
secondarily liable or contingently liable for any Assumed Liability) to any
third party in connection with the Seller Parties obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 2.02(a)_, in each case other than payment obligations that are
borne by Buyer. If, on the Closing Date, any such consent has not been
obtained, or if an attempted transfer or assignment thereof would be
ineffective or a violation of Law, the Seller Parties and Buyer shall, subject
to _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ and  _Section_ __ _ 6.05_, enter into a mutually
agreeable arrangement (i) under which Buyer will, in compliance with Law,
obtain the benefits and assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens
associated with such Transferred Asset, claim, right or benefit in accordance
with this

 



7

    

 Agreement, including subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to Buyer or
(ii) under which the Seller Parties will enforce for the benefit (and at the
expense) of Buyer any and all of the rights of Seller and its Subsidiaries
against a third party associated with such Transferred Asset, claim, right or
benefit, and the Seller Parties would promptly pay to Buyer when received all
monies or other benefits received by them under any such Transferred Asset,
claim, right or benefit (net of the Seller Parties expenses incurred in
connection with any assignment contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_).

 

(b) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts prior to the Closing to cause the
counterparty to each Specified Shared Contract to consent to the partial
assignment of those rights of the applicable Seller Party under such Specified
Shared Contract related to the Business, and otherwise reasonably cooperate
with Buyer in good faith in respect of Buyers efforts to enter into a
new contract or agreement with the counterparty to any Specified Shared
Contract providing goods or services from or to the Business on substantially
the same terms as exist under such Specified Shared Contract as of the Closing
(and in such case, such new contract or agreement shall constitute a
Transferred Asset hereunder); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.02(b)_ shall require any of the Seller Parties or any of
their Affiliates to make any payment or other concession to such
counterparty, or commence or participate in any Action, in each case, in
connection with this _Section_ __ _ 2.02(b)_, in each case, other than
payment obligations that are borne by Buyer. Any Specified Shared Contract
for which the arrangements described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.02(b)_ could
not be entered into prior to the Closing shall be subject to _Section_ __ _
2.02(a)_ and, with respect to any other Shared Contract, (i) Seller and Buyer
shall work in good faith to determine the feasibility of separating such
Shared Contract and (ii) if, notwithstanding such good-faith efforts, the
parties are unable to agree on a mutually satisfactory plan for separating
any such Shared Contract, Buyer and Seller will negotiate in good faith
appropriate means for Buyer to obtain the benefits and assume the obligations
associated with the portion of such Shared Contract relating to the Business
for a transitional period. As used herein, "Specified Shared Contract" shall
mean any Shared Contract primarily relating to the Business.

 

Section 2.03. _Closing_. The closing of the sale and purchase of the
Transferred Equity Interests and the Transferred Assets and the assumption of
the Assumed Liabilities (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New
York, New York 10019, at 9:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the later of (i)
the first Business Day of the first calendar month that commences after the
month in which all Closing Conditions are satisfied or waived in writing (to
the extent permitted by applicable Law) in accordance with _Article X_ (other
than those Closing Conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those Closing Conditions
at such time), or (ii) the first Business Day of the calendar month
that commences following the expiration of sixty (60) days after the delivery
of the Audited Financial Statements, or on such other date or at such other
time or place as the Parties may agree in writing (or such earlier date as may
be specified by Buyer on no less than five (5) Business Days prior written
notice to Seller; provided, that such earlier date is the first Business Day
of a calendar month). The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the "Closing Date." For all purposes under this Agreement
and each other Transaction Agreement, (a) all matters at the Closing will be
considered to take place simultaneously and (b) the Closing shall be deemed
effective as of the Effective Time.

 



8

    

Section 2.04. _Withholding_. In the event Buyer determines that any portion of
the purchase price or any amount otherwise payable under this Agreement would
be subject to withholding or deduction under applicable Law, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts from such
payments to the extent required under applicable Law; _provided_ that Buyer
shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify Seller of
such determination and (ii) shall cooperate with Seller Parties in good faith
to reduce or mitigate any such withholding or deduction (including through
the provision of forms or other relevant documentation by the Seller Parties).
If Buyer withholds on any portion of the purchase price pursuant to the terms
of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ and pays over such withheld amount to the
appropriate Taxing Authority, such withheld amount shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable recipient of
such amount otherwise payable.

Section 2.05. _Deferred Transfers_ _; Specified Assets_.

 

(a) If all of the conditions to Closing specified in _Section_ __ _ 10.01_
and _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ are satisfied or have been waived (other than
those which, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to such satisfaction), the Parties shall not at the Closing effect the
transfer of the Transferred Assets and Transferred Equity Interests and
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in any jurisdiction where such transfer
or assumption would give rise to a material violation of any Legal Restraint
(each such portion of the Business that is not transferred at Closing,
a "Deferred Business") but, the Closing shall nevertheless occur with respect
to the Business (other than any Deferred Business) and, from and after the
Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
such material violation of such Legal Restraint in such jurisdiction to cease
to exist with respect to such transfer and assumption as promptly as
practicable after the Closing Date, and immediately following such time as the
transfer of the applicable Deferred Business can be consummated without
giving rise to a material violation of such Legal Restraint, such transfer of
the applicable Deferred Business shall be consummated. The Parties will act in
good faith to minimize the costs of the transfer of the Deferred Business.
The Parties also agree that until the consummation of the transfer of the
applicable Deferred Business, the Deferred Business shall be held, managed and
operated by Seller (or its Subsidiaries) in the manner provided in _Schedule
2.05_. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchase Price paid by Buyer at the
Closing shall not be reduced or otherwise adjusted in connection with the
delayed transfer of a Deferred Business.

 

(b) In connection with the matters contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.05(a)_
and _Schedule 2.05_ , Seller (or its Subsidiaries) and Buyer shall prepare
and negotiate in good faith to enter into on or prior to the Closing (or, if
not feasible, as promptly as practicable after the Closing) such supplemental
agreements as are reasonably necessary to place the Parties and their
Affiliates in the same financial position with respect to the Deferred
Business as would have obtained if the Deferred Business were transferred at
the Closing; _provided_ , that the execution and delivery of such
agreements shall not be a condition to the Closing.

(c) In the event that the failure of the Transferred Assets to include a
Specified Asset (as a result of the inclusion of the word "primarily" in
clause (c) of the definition of "Related to the Business") would cause a
breach of the representation and warranty set forth in _Section_ __ _
4.18(a)_, following the request of Buyer delivered within one year following
the Closing Date, Seller shall cooperate in good faith with Buyer to remedy
such breach, either

 



9

    

 through the transfer of the applicable Specified Asset or through the
provision of appropriate contractual arrangements to provide the benefits and
burdens of ownership thereof. "Specified Asset"" means an asset that does not
constitute a Transferred Asset, but would constitute a Transferred Asset in
accordance with the terms hereof if clause (c) of the definition of "Related
to the Business" were revised by removing each instance of the word
"primarily."

Section 2.06. _Structure of Transfers_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
2.01_ (and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement),
each Transferred Asset and Assumed Liability shall at the Closing be sold,
transferred, assumed or assigned (a "Transfer") to Buyer by way of either (i)
a Transfer by Seller or its Subsidiaries of equity interests (each such
transfer, an "Equity Transfer") in a Subsidiary (which may be a newly formed
Subsidiary) that is either (A) directly owned by one or more of the Seller
Parties (each such Subsidiary (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Minority-Owned JVs), a "Company," and together, the "Companies," and the
issued and outstanding equity interests in the Companies, the
"Transferred Equity Interests"), or (B) directly or indirectly owned by one
or more of the Companies (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Minority-
Owned JVs, the "Business Subsidiaries," and together with the Companies,
the "Transferred Entities"), or (ii) a direct Transfer of such Transferred
Asset or Assumed Liability (each such transfer, an "Asset/Liability
Transfer"), as determined in accordance with _Schedule 2.06_ and this
_Section_ __ _ 2.06_.

(b) Promptly following the Agreement Date, but in no event later than forty-
five (45) days following the Agreement Date, Seller shall, following
consultation with Buyer (which consultation shall include exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the other Party may reasonably
request), deliver to Buyer a notice (the "Seller Transfer Proposal") setting
forth, in reasonable detail, for each Transferred Asset and Assumed Liability
(which for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ may include a designated
group of Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities) the Transfer of which is
not addressed on _Schedule 2.06_ , Sellers proposal with respect to whether
such Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability (or group of Transferred Assets or
Assumed Liabilities) shall be Transferred to Buyer by way of either (x) an
Equity Transfer or (y) an Asset/Liability Transfer for Buyers review and
comment. Seller shall consider in good faith any comments provided by Buyer
with respect to the Seller Transfer Proposal and Seller shall incorporate
into the Seller Transfer Proposal any of Buyers comments that do not subject
Seller or any Seller Affiliate to any material unreimbursed cost. If, with
respect to any Equity Transfer of any individual Transferred Entity, Buyer
does not desire for such Equity Transfer to be treated as an asset sale for
U.S. income Tax purposes, then Buyer may, at its option, deliver to Seller a
notice within thirty (30) days of delivering the Seller Transfer Proposal,
electing such treatment (the "U.S. Stock Treatment Election") but only so long
as such election does not subject Seller or any Seller Affiliate to any
material unreimbursed cost.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is reasonably anticipated that any
Asset/Liability Transfer otherwise required hereunder cannot be completed by
the time of the Closing despite Sellers reasonable best efforts to complete
such Asset/Liability Transfer by the time of the Closing, Seller may propose a
set of modifications to the Seller Transfer Proposal, _Schedule 2.06_  and
_Schedule 3.07,_ that would provide equivalent aggregate value to Buyer as the
Seller Transfer Proposal, _Schedule 2.06_ and _Schedule 3.07_ prior to any
such modifications, acceptance of such proposal being subject to Buyers
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



10

    

(d) At the Closing, Seller shall Transfer or cause to be Transferred all
Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities addressed in the Seller Transfer
Proposal or _Schedule 2.06_ in respect of which a U.S. Stock Treatment
Election has been validly made. At the Closing for any Equity Transfer for
which Buyer has not validly made a U.S. Stock Treatment Election, Seller
shall be required to effect the Transfer of such Transferred Assets and
Assumed Liabilities as an asset sale for U.S. income Tax purposes; provided
that Seller may, with Buyers prior written approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), determine the manner in which to effect
such treatment, including by (1) filing an election pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 301.7701-3, effective from a date prior to the Closing
Date, to cause the applicable Transferred Entities to be treated as one or
more disregarded entities, partnerships or other pass-through entities for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes at the time of the Closing, (2) filing an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to one or more
applicable Transferred Entities, (3) consenting to Buyer filing an election
under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to one or more applicable
Transferred Entities, (4) filing an election under Section 754 of the Code
with respect to one or more applicable Transferred Entities, (5) an
Asset/Liability Transfer or (6) any other manner.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller, at its
election may or at Buyers request shall prior to the Closing, undertake, or
cause its applicable Subsidiaries to undertake, certain Transfers of
Transferred Assets, Assumed Liabilities, Excluded Assets and Excluded
Liabilities among Seller and any of its Subsidiaries as mutually agreed among
Buyer and Seller so long as the Transferred Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities are Transferred to Buyer in accordance with the Equity Transfers
and Asset/Liability Transfers determined by the procedures set forth in
clauses _(a)_ through _(d)_  of this _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ and provided that
(i) such Transfers are not inconsistent with _Schedule 2.06_ or the Seller
Transfer Proposal (as finalized pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.06(b)_), (ii)
such Transfers would not materially adversely affect the Tax liability of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, any Transferred
Entity) with respect to a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after
the Closing Date, and (iii) in the event that such Transfers would increase
the aggregate Transfer Taxes payable by Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.07_, as compared to the Transfer Taxes payable by Buyer if the Transfers had
been undertaken in the most tax-efficient and otherwise cost-effective manner
legally available, Buyer provides its prior written consent to such Transfer
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(f) For any Equity Transfer that is to be effected in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.06_, at the Closing, in lieu of the purchase and sale of
Transferred Assets as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_, each of the
applicable Seller Parties shall Transfer to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase,
acquire and accept from each such Seller Party, all of such Seller Partys
right, title and interest in and to the Transferred Equity Interests.



 



11

    

(g) For all purposes of this _Article II_ , any Transfer to Buyer may be made
to either Buyer or a designated Affiliate thereof upon prior written notice
to Seller to the extent in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 13.06_, and in such
case, any representations and warranties made with respect to Buyer in
_Article V_  shall additionally be deemed to be given by such designated
Affiliate; _provided_ that in the case of any Transfer that is effected as an
Asset/Liability Transfer, the Buyer or designated Affiliate must be organized
in and be tax resident in the same jurisdiction as the applicable Seller
Party or Subsidiary thereof unless designation of the Buyer or an Affiliate
organized or tax resident in a different jurisdiction would not subject Seller
or any Seller Affiliate to any material unreimbursed cost, except as set
forth on _Schedule 2.06_.

(h) Prior to the Closing, either Buyer or Seller may propose amendments to
the Seller Transfer Proposal, _Schedule 2.06_ and _Schedule 3.07_ , and the
Parties shall consider such proposed amendments in good faith; _provided_ ,
that neither Buyer nor Seller shall be obligated to agree to any such
amendment of the Seller Transfer Proposal, _Schedule_ __ _ 2.06_, or
_Schedule 3.07_ to the extent such amendment would subject such Person (or
their respective Affiliates) to any material unreimbursed cost.

Seller Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, if Buyer accepts the Closing
Payment delivered in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.03_, Buyer shall

Section 3.04. _Proposed Final Closing Statement and Final Closing Statement_.

 

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to Seller the
Proposed Final Closing Statement, together with reasonable supporting
documentation. During such 90 day period, Buyer and its Representatives shall
be permitted to review Sellers work papers and all books and records of
Seller used in the preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement and Seller
shall promptly, and in any event within such time frame as reasonably
required by Buyer, make available the individuals in its and its Subsidiaries
employ as well as Representatives of its independent accountants responsible
for and knowledgeable about the information used in, and the preparation of,
the Estimated Closing Statement, to respond to the reasonable inquiries of, or
requests for information by, Buyer or its Representatives.

 

(b) Seller shall have 60 days (the "Review Period") after Buyers delivery of
the Proposed Final Closing Statement to review the same. During the Review
Period, Seller and its Representatives shall be permitted to review Buyers
work papers and all books and records of the Business (including, after the
Closing, the Transferred Entities) used in the preparation of the Proposed
Final Closing Statement and Buyer shall promptly, and in any event within such
time frame as reasonably required by Seller, make available the individuals in
its and its Subsidiaries employ as well as Representatives of its
independent accountants responsible for and knowledgeable about the
information used in, and the preparation of, the Proposed Final Closing
Statement, to respond to the reasonable inquiries of, or requests for
information by, Seller or its Representatives. Buyer agrees that, following
the Closing through the date that the Final Closing Statement becomes
conclusive and binding upon the Parties in accordance with _Article III_ , it
will not (and will cause its Subsidiaries not to) take any actions with
respect to any books, records, policies or procedures on which the Proposed
Final Closing Statement is based or on which the Final Closing Statement is to
be based or that would materially impede or delay the determination of the
amount of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment or the preparation of the
Dispute Notice or the Final Closing Statement in the manner and utilizing the
methods required by this Agreement.

 

(c) If Seller disputes any item set forth in the Proposed Final Closing
Statement, Seller shall, during the Review Period, deliver written notice to
Buyer of the same, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute
and Sellers proposed modifications to the Proposed Final Closing Statement
(such notice, the "Dispute Notice"). Any matters not identified in the
Dispute Notice delivered in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.04(c)_ as
being in dispute shall be deemed to have been agreed to and shall be
conclusive and binding upon the 

 



15

    

 Parties. During the 30-day period immediately following Sellers delivery of
a Dispute Notice (the "Resolution Period"), Buyer and Seller shall negotiate
in good faith to reach an agreement as to any matters identified in such
Dispute Notice as being in dispute, and, to the extent such matters are so
resolved within the Resolution Period, then the Proposed Final
Closing Statement as revised to incorporate such changes as have been agreed
between Buyer and Seller shall be conclusive and binding upon all Parties as
the Final Closing Statement.

 

(d) If Buyer and Seller fail to resolve all such matters in dispute within the
Resolution Period, then (subject to the last sentence of  _Section_ __ _
3.04(e)_) such matters (and only such matters) identified in such Dispute
Notice that remain in dispute following the expiration of the Resolution
Period shall be finally and conclusively determined by Deloitte (and if
Deloitte is unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, such other globally
recognized accounting firm as shall be agreed upon in writing by Seller and
Buyer) (the "Independent Accounting Firm").

 

(e) Seller and Buyer shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to
promptly, but no later than 40 days after its acceptance of its appointment,
determine (it being understood that in making such determination, the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be functioning as an expert and not as an
arbitrator), based solely on written presentations of Buyer and Seller
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm and not by independent review,
only those matters in dispute and will render a written report setting forth
its determination as to the disputed matters and the resulting calculations of
Final Closing Cash, Final Working Capital, the Final Working Capital Increase
(if any), the Final Working Capital Decrease (if any), Final Closing Debt,
Final Transaction Expenses, the Final EBITDA-Based Reduction (if any), the
Final Purchase Price Adjustment and the Post-Closing Adjustment (if any),
which report and calculations will be conclusive and binding upon all Parties
and shall constitute the Final Closing Statement for all purposes hereunder
absent manifest mathematical error. A copy of all materials submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
shall be provided by Seller or Buyer, as applicable, to the other Party
concurrently with the submission thereof to the Independent Accounting Firm.
In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm (i) shall be
bound by the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 3.04(e)_ and _Section_ __ _
3.06_ and (ii) may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by Buyer or Seller, or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by Buyer or Seller. If, before the Independent
Accounting Firm renders its determination with respect to the disputed items
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.04(e)_, (x) Seller notifies Buyer
of its agreement with any items in the Proposed Final Closing Statement, (y)
Buyer notifies Seller of its agreement with any items in the Estimated Closing
Statement or (z) Buyer and Seller otherwise reach mutual agreement with
respect to any items subject to dispute, then in each case such items as so
agreed will be conclusive and binding on all Parties immediately upon such
notice and shall constitute the Final Closing Statement for such items.

(f) The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by
the Party whose aggregate position with respect to Final Purchase Price
Adjustment is further from Final Purchase Price Adjustment as determined by
the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04(e)_ or, if
the positions of each Party with respect to Final Purchase Price Adjustment
are equidistant from the Final Purchase Price Adjustment as determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04(e)_, then the
fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally
by the Parties.

 



16

    

Section 3.05. _Post-Closing Adjustment_. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is
a positive amount, Buyer shall pay an amount equal to the Post-Closing
Adjustment to Seller. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount,
Seller shall repay an amount equal to the absolute value of the Post-Closing
Adjustment to Buyer. Any payment due under this _Section_ __ _ 3.05_ shall
be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account
designated by Seller or a bank account designated by Buyer, as applicable,
within five (5) Business Days after the date on which the Final Closing
Statement becomes conclusive and binding on the Parties in accordance with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.04_, and, if not paid within such period,
shall bear interest at the Interest Rate. All computations of interest shall
be made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 13.17_.

Section 3.06.  _Certain Calculation Principles_. Each Closing Statement shall
be (a) prepared and determined from the books and records of the Business in
accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles; and (b) consistent with
the provisions of this Agreement relating to the Parties respective rights
and obligations for the payment or reimbursement of costs and expenses.

 

Section 3.07. _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Purchase Price shall be
initially allocated (before taking into account the Post-Closing Adjustment
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04_), absent manifest error, among the
Transferred Equity Interests or the Transferred Assets in each jurisdiction
specifically addressed in _Schedule 3.07_ (the "Allocation Schedule") in
accordance with the Allocation Schedule, and, further, between the date hereof
and the Closing Date, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
good faith to agree on an initial allocation of the Purchase Price (before
taking into account the Post-Closing Adjustment pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.04_), based on a "more likely than not" reporting standard, among the
Transferred Equity Interests or the Transferred Assets taking into account
and not inconsistent with _Schedule 3.07_. The Parties shall, within sixty
(60) days following the determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.04_, use commercially reasonable efforts in good faith
to agree on an update to the Allocation Schedule to reflect such Post-Closing
Adjustment. In the event of any dispute with respect to matters addressed by
this _Section_ __ _ 3.07_, such dispute shall be referred to the Independent
Accounting Firm in accordance with the principles and procedures of _Section_
__ _ 3.04(e)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.04(f)_, except that the fees and expenses
of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the
Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by the Seller.

hereto and thereto) this Agreement constitutes, and upon execution and
delivery thereof, the other Buyer Transaction Agreements will constitute,

accordance with their respective terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception.

Section 5.02. _No Conflict_. Provided that all Consents and other actions
described in  _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ have been obtained, except as may result
from any facts or circumstances relating to the Seller Parties, the Companies

franchise or other material instrument to which Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates is a party or by which any of such assets or
properties is bound, except for any such breaches, defaults, rights or Liens
as would not materially impair or delay the ability of Buyer to consummate
the Buyer Transactions or otherwise perform its obligations under the Buyer
Transaction Agreements.

performance by Buyer of the Buyer Transaction Agreements do not and will not
require any material Consent, waiver or other action by, or any material
filing with or notification to, any Government Authority, except (a) in

requirements under applicable Regulatory Laws, (b) where the failure to obtain
such Consent or waiver, to take such action or to make such filing or
notification would not materially impair or delay the ability of Buyer to
consummate the Buyer Transactions or otherwise perform its obligations under
the Buyer Transaction Agreements or (c) as may be necessary as a result of
any facts or circumstances relating to the Seller Parties, the Companies or
their respective Affiliates.

Section 5.04.  _Absence of Restraints; Compliance with Laws_. As of the

term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act). The

public distribution or sale of the Transferred Equity Interests or any
interest in them. Buyer has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial
and business matters to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the Transferred Equity Interests, and Buyer is capable
of bearing the economic risks of such investment, including a complete loss

aware of, any obligation, commitment, restriction or other Liability of any
kind, in each case, that would impair or adversely affect such resources,
funds or capabilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obligations of Buyer under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, Buyers obligations to consummate
the Transactions) are not contingent upon Buyer having sufficient funds for
the payment of the Purchase Price and the other amounts payable hereunder.

 



37

the Financing, and assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of Seller (determined without giving effect to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect qualifications therein, except as provided in

obligations to be transferred, directly or indirectly, pursuant to the
Transaction Agreements, adequate for such purposes. Buyer further acknowledges
and agrees that (x) the only representations and warranties made by Seller are
the representations and warranties expressly set forth in  _Article IV_ (as
modified by the Disclosure Schedules) or the other Transaction Agreements and
Buyer has not relied upon any other express or implied representations,
warranties or other projections, forecasts, estimates,

diligence information, and that, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in _Article IV_ or the other Transaction
Agreements, Buyer will not have any right or remedy arising out of any such

__ _ 6.03(b)_ shall continue to apply to such resulting or sold entity as if
such entity was Seller hereunder. Seller shall, prior to any such transaction,
secure from such transferred or sold entity an executed joinder agreement to
the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_ that is directly enforceable by
Buyer.

 

Section 6.04. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Consents_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of

that, notwithstanding the 

 



44

    

 foregoing, none of Seller, any Subsidiary of Seller or Buyer or any
Subsidiary of Buyer shall be required to make any payments or concessions in
connection with the fulfillment of its obligations in this _Section_ __ _
6.04(a)(iv)_ and that neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall pay any
consideration or make any agreements or commitments in connection with any
such necessary consents, approvals or waivers without the prior written
consent of Buyer. As promptly as Buyer deems advisable (after consulting with,
and considering in good faith the views of Seller) following the date of this
Agreement, but no later than sixty (60) days after the date hereof, each
Party shall make its respective filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Transactions and shall supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable thereafter to the appropriate Government Authorities any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act. Each Party agrees to make as promptly as Buyer deems
advisable (after consulting with, and considering in good faith the views of
Seller) its respective filings and notifications, if any, under any other
applicable Regulatory Law, and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable
to the appropriate Government Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the applicable
Regulatory Law.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertaking of Buyer pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 6.04(a)_, Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, use its and their best efforts, and take any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Regulatory
Law that may be asserted by any Government Authority or any other Persons
("Regulatory Law Impediment" ) so as to enable the Parties to consummate the
Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside
Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition of such of its and their assets, properties or
businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by Buyer
pursuant hereto, and entering into behavioral or conduct remedies and such
other actions or arrangements, as are necessary or advisable in order to avoid
any Regulatory Law Impediment, including the entry of, and the commencement
of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order in any suit or
proceeding by a Government Authority or any other person under
Regulatory Laws that would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying
or preventing the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(b)_ or
any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries be required to agree to (nor shall Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries be permitted to agree unless Buyer so directs them (and they
shall, if Buyer so directs, agree to, so long as such agreements are limited
to the Business and are conditioned upon the Closing)), any action, concession
or undertaking, unless such action, concession or undertaking is conditioned
on the Closing. In addition, Buyer shall defend through litigation on the
merits any Claim asserted in court by any Government Authority or any other
person under Regulatory Laws in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
would prevent the Closing prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such obligation to litigate in no way limits the obligation of Buyer to
use, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, its and their best efforts,
and to take any and all steps necessary to eliminate each and every
impediment under any Regulatory Law to consummate the Transactions prior to
the Outside Date.

 



45

    

(c) Each Party shall keep the other Party apprised of the content and status
of any communications with, and communications from, any Government Authority
with respect to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the other Party
of any material communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Government Authority relating to any review or investigation of the
Transactions under the HSR Act or any other applicable non-United States
Regulatory Laws and shall permit the other Party to review in advance (and to
consider any comments made by the other Party in relation to) any proposed
substantive communication by such Party to any Government Authority relating
to such matters. None of the Parties shall agree to participate in any
substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion with any Government
Authority in respect of any submissions, filings, investigation (including any
settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement unless it consults with the
other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Government
Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate at
such meeting, telephone call or discussion. The Parties will coordinate
and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and
providing such assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. The Parties shall
provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications between them or any of their representatives, on the one hand,
and any Government Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted (i) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Business, (ii) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns;
_provided_ , _further_ , that each Party may reasonably designate materials,
including materials submitted with that Partys regulatory filings, as
"Outside Counsel Only" or "Outside Advisors Only," in which case access to
such materials shall be restricted accordingly. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to Sellers
consultation and participation rights described above, Buyer shall have the
principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for
obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition or investment review
clearances as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside
Date, including in connection with the determination of any actions to be
taken under _Section_ __ _ 6.04(b)_, and shall take the lead in all meetings
and communications with any Government Authority in connection with obtaining
any necessary antitrust, competition or investment review clearances;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if by December 31, 2019 any Required Approval
has not been obtained or agreed to in principle with the applicable Government
Authority and such Required Approval has not been waived, Buyer will use its
best efforts in its interactions with any such Government Authority to cause
such Government Authority to offer a path or paths forward that would resolve
such Government Authoritys concerns as promptly as practicable thereafter.

 

(d) Buyer shall not enter into any agreement, transaction or any agreement to
effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or materially and adversely affect
Buyers ability to (i) obtain the timely expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act, or the authorizations, consents, Orders and
approvals required under any other applicable Regulatory Law, applicable to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) avoid the entry of, the
commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order that would
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions, or (iii)
obtain all authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals of Government
Authorities necessary for the consummation of the Transactions in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



46

    

Section 6.05. _Permits_. Seller will use reasonable best efforts to provide
Buyer with a list of all material Permits necessary for Buyer to own and
operate the Business, the Transferred Entities or the Transferred Assets, as
promptly as practicable following the Agreement Date. Seller and its
Affiliates shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining
any Permits necessary (or that may become necessary) for Buyer to own or
operate the Business, the Transferred Entities or the Transferred Assets.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Seller Party, nor any of
their Subsidiaries, shall be required to compensate any third party, commence
or participate in any Action or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise, including any accommodation or arrangement to indemnify,
remain secondarily liable or contingently liable for any Assumed Liability)
to any third party in connection with the Seller Parties obligations under
this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_, in each case other than payment obligations that
are borne by Buyer. If any such Permit is not obtained prior to the Closing,
Seller, its Affiliates and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to enter into a
reasonable transitional arrangement (to the extent permitted by the terms of
the applicable Permit and applicable Law and at Buyers sole expense) under
which Buyer shall obtain the benefit of such Permit in connection with the
ownership or operation of the Business, the Transferred Entities or the
Transferred Assets; _provided_  that in the case of any such arrangement,
without limiting the second sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_, Buyer
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the applicable Permit as promptly
as practicable after the Closing.

 

Section 6.06. _Guarantees; Other Obligations_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Agreement Date, Seller shall
provide to Buyer a schedule listing all of the outstanding Seller Guarantees.
At or before the Closing, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to (i)
arrange for substitute letters of credit, Buyer guarantees and other
obligations to replace any outstanding Seller Guarantees or (ii) to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms thereof, assume all
obligations (solely to the extent constituting Assumed Liabilities) under each
Seller Guarantee, and obtain from the creditor, beneficiary or other
counterparty a full release (in a form satisfactory to Seller) of all parties
liable, directly or indirectly, for reimbursement to the creditor or
fulfillment of other obligations to a beneficiary or counterparty in
connection with amounts drawn under the Seller Guarantees (solely to
the extent relating to the Business). In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer and have the
primary responsibility to direct the process by which the Parties approach the
beneficiaries or counterparties of such Seller Guarantees, including by
taking the lead in all meetings, discussions and communications with
beneficiaries or counterparties. To the extent the beneficiary or counterparty
under any Seller Guarantees does not accept any such substitute letter of
credit, Buyer guarantee or other obligation proffered by Buyer and Buyer is
not permitted to assume or cause to be assumed any such Seller Guarantee in
accordance with the foregoing clause (ii) from and after the Closing, Buyer
shall (x) indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Subsidiaries
against, and reimburse Seller and its Subsidiaries for, all amounts paid that
are reasonably incurred, including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs or expenses in connection with such Seller

 



47

    

 Guarantees, including Sellers and its Subsidiaries reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs or expenses in maintaining such Seller
Guarantees, whether or not any such Seller Guarantee is drawn upon or required
to be performed, and shall in any event promptly reimburse Seller and its
Subsidiaries to the extent any Seller Guarantee is drawn upon and Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries makes any payment or reimburses the party issuing the
Seller Guarantee and (y) not without Sellers prior written consent, amend in
any manner adverse to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or extend (or permit
the extension of), any Seller Guarantee or any obligation supported by any
Seller Guarantee.

(b) Except for those Intercompany Agreements specifically contemplated by
this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements to survive the Closing or to the
extent necessary to effectuate _Section_ __ _ 6.07(b)_, Seller shall
terminate or cause to be terminated all Intercompany Agreements, in each case
without any Liability to Buyer, the Business or any of Buyers Affiliates
(including the Transferred Entities).

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Seller Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, in consultation and cooperation with Buyer, to identify, pay off,
discharge and satisfy in full, or cause the Transferred Entities and the JVs
to identify, pay off, discharge and satisfy in full, all liabilities pursuant
to any Related Party Financing (each such payment, a "Related Party Financing
Payment"). The Parties agree that for purposes of this Agreement, (x) the
Related Party Financing Payments, if any, shall be deemed to occur prior in
time to the payment of the Purchase Price; (y) a Related Party Financing
Payment shall be deemed to occur prior to Buyer or any Buyer Affiliate taking
title to any equity interest in the applicable Transferred Entity or JV that
is the obligor in respect of the applicable Related Party Financing Payment;
and (z) Buyer and its respective Affiliates will take title to any equity
interest of a Transferred Entity or JV only following the satisfaction of the
Related Party Financing Payment in respect of which such Transferred Entity or
JV is the obligor. If fewer than all the Related Party Financing Payments
have been made by Closing, the Parties agree to treat the Transferred Entity
or JV that is the obligor in respect of any such Related Party Financing
Payment that remains unpaid as of the Closing as a Deferred Business and the
applicable Related Party Financing Payment as a Legal Restraint with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ applying mutatis mutandis to the transfer
thereof, such that the interests in the applicable Transferred Entity or JV
shall not be transferred to Buyer prior to the applicable Related Party
Financing Payment.

 

Section 6.07. _Cooperation_. 

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, each of Seller and Buyer shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, (i) except where greater efforts or
outright non-efforts based obligations are expressly required by the terms of
this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to cause all Closing
Conditions of the other Party to be met as promptly as practicable after the
Agreement Date and in any event on or before the Outside Date and (ii) without
limiting any other obligations set forth in this Agreement, keep the other
Party reasonably apprised of the status of the matters relating to the
completion of the Transactions, including with respect to the negotiations
relating to the satisfaction of the Closing Conditions of the other Party.
This  _Section_ __ _ 6.06(c)_ shall not apply with respect to Government
Approvals, which are governed solely by _Section_ __ _ 6.04_.

 



48

    

(b) As soon as practicable after the Agreement Date, the Parties shall
cooperate in good faith to develop a plan for separating the Business from
the other businesses of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Entities) so as to minimize the adverse impact of such separation on each
Partys business. Without limiting the foregoing, and as soon as practicable
after the Agreement Date, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to separate
the data related to the Business from the data relating to the other
businesses of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Entities), including (i) the migration of employees unrelated to the Business
to an information system separate from the Business Systems, (ii) the
duplication for the Business of enterprise applications that are shared
between the Business, on the one hand, and the other businesses of Seller and
its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities), on the other hand, (iii)
the separation of electronic data related to the Business from Sellers
systems and the transfer and integration of such electronic data to the
Business Systems and (iv) the separation and removal of electronic data
unrelated to the Business from the Business Systems.

 

Section 6.08. _Shared Space Agreements_. If, from and after the execution of
this Agreement, until the date that is three (3) months after the Closing
Date, either Party determines that (i) a portion of the business of Seller or
its Subsidiaries (other than the Business) is being conducted at any
Transferred Real Property or (ii) a portion of the Business is being
conducted at any Retained Real Property, then each such property identified by
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall constitute a Shared Location. Upon
identification of such Shared Location, Buyer and Seller shall work in good
faith to determine the feasibility of separating the business operations of
the parties at such Shared Location and/or relocating the operations to
another property. If, notwithstanding such good-faith efforts, the parties are
unable to agree on a mutually satisfactory plan for separating the business
operations of the parties and/or relocating the operations, Buyer and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith and cooperate to prepare, as soon as reasonably
practicable, a Shared Space Agreement for each such Shared Location. Each
such Shared Space Agreement shall take into account the specific use by each
party of the applicable Shared Location and the other specific characteristics
of such Shared Location. To the extent such Shared Space Agreement concerns
any leased real property, such Shared Space Agreement shall take into
consideration the terms of the applicable lease, sublease or license. To the
extent such Shared Space Agreement concerns any owned real property, such
Shared Space Agreement shall be on customary and market terms reflecting the
characteristics and location of the applicable Shared Location (subject to
terms reflecting the particular business plans and business needs of the
parties and approved by the parties, each acting reasonably). Seller shall
use reasonable best efforts to complete the separation of Shared Locations
such that the Business Employees and the operations of the Business are
segregated from the other employees and operations of the other businesses
conducted by Seller at the Shared Locations prior to or at the Closing and all
costs associated with such separations shall be borne by Seller.

 

Section 6.09. _Subject Jurisdiction Put Options_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not constitute a binding agreement to sell or purchase any of the
Subject Jurisdiction Businesses until the Subject Jurisdiction Put Option with
respect to the applicable Business is exercised.

 



49

    

(b) In the event that the Subject Jurisdiction Put Option is exercised with
respect to any Subject Jurisdiction Business on or prior to Closing, this
_Section_ __ _ 6.09_ shall terminate and shall cease to have effect with
respect to such applicable Subject Jurisdiction Business.

 

(c) In the event that the Subject Jurisdiction Put Option is not exercised on
or prior to Closing with respect to any Subject Jurisdiction: 

(i) _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ and _Article VIII_ (the "Disapplied Provisions")

deemed to exclude the applicable Subject Jurisdiction Transferred Assets, (D)
the term "Assumed Liabilities" shall be deemed to exclude the applicable
Subject Jurisdiction Assumed Liabilities and (E) the term
"Business Employees" shall be deemed to exclude the applicable Subject
Jurisdiction Employees;

(iii) the parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree on any amendments to
this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Local Transfer
Agreements and the other Transaction Agreements as may be required in order to
give effect to the principles set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.09_; and

(iv) the Purchase Price shall be reduced as mutually agreed by Seller and
Buyer.

not a portion) of the Subject Jurisdiction Transferred Equity Interests,
Subject Jurisdiction Transferred Assets and Subject Jurisdiction Assumed
Liabilities in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions
specified in this Agreement with respect to any Subject Jurisdiction (each, a
"Subject Jurisdiction Put Option"), it being understood that, for the sake of
clarity, if any Subject Jurisdiction Put Option is exercised prior to Closing,
the Subject Jurisdiction Transferred Equity Interests, Subject Jurisdiction
Transferred Assets and Subject Jurisdiction Assumed Liabilities with respect
to the applicable Subject Jurisdiction shall be included in the Transferred
Equity Interests, Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities and the purchase
price for such Subject Jurisdiction Transferred Equity Interests, Subject
Jurisdiction Transferred Equity Interests and Subject Jurisdiction Assumed
Liabilities shall be included in the computation of the Purchase Price.

(ii) Seller hereby accepts the benefit of the Subject Jurisdiction Put Option
and may, at its own discretion and option, elect to exercise the Subject
Jurisdiction Put Option in accordance with the procedures set forth herein,
without having Seller being committed to sell to Buyer the Subject
Jurisdiction Business. Seller shall only be entitled to exercise the Subject
Jurisdiction Put Option for all (and not a portion) of the Subject
Jurisdiction Transferred Equity Interests, Subject Jurisdiction Transferred
Assets and Subject Jurisdiction Assumed Liabilities in each Subject
Jurisdiction. Seller undertakes that the applicable Seller Party owns and
will own all the issued and outstanding equity interests in the Subsidiaries
in each Subject Jurisdiction until each Subject Jurisdiction Put Option is
exercised or terminated.

 



50

    

(iii) The Subject Jurisdiction Put Option will enter into force at the
Agreement Date.

 

(iv) The Subject Jurisdiction Put Option may be exercised by Seller at any
time, after the date upon which all of the information and consultation
processes of the applicable Works Council(s) have been completed in
accordance with the applicable Laws, until the Expiry Date, by sending to
Buyer a notice, in form set out under _Schedule 6.10(iv)_ (the
"Exercise Notice").

(v) If Seller has not exercised the Subject Jurisdiction Put Option with
respect to any Subject Jurisdiction Business on or before the Expiry Date,
then, the Subject Jurisdiction Put Option with respect to such Subject
Jurisdiction Business shall automatically lapse, without any action on the
part of either party.

 

(vi) As soon as practicable, Seller will cause its relevant Subsidiaries (i)
to initiate the information and consultation processes of the relevant
employee representative bodies required under applicable Laws in the Subject
Jurisdictions (collectively, the "Works Councils") in connection with the sale
of the Subject Jurisdiction Business and (ii) to use their reasonable best
efforts to pursue diligently such procedures in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations and to obtain the delivery of the Works Councils
opinions as soon as possible.

 

(vii) The Parties shall keep each other regularly informed of the status of
each these processes, consult with each other in good faith in obtaining such
opinions and provide to each other Party a copy of the opinions of the Works
Councils (to the extent available) as soon as possible after obtaining such
opinions.

 

(viii) Each Subject Jurisdiction Put Option shall automatically terminate on
the earlier of (a) the valid termination of this Agreement and (b) the date
that is sixty (60) Business Days after Sellers receipt of the final opinion
from the Works Council in the applicable Subject Jurisdiction in connection
with the Transaction or, in the absence of any opinion, the date upon which
the Works Council is deemed to have issued a negative opinion under applicable
Law (the "Expiry Date"), unless the Subject Jurisdiction Put Option is
exercised on or prior to such date.

 

Section 6.11. _Factored Receivables_ _; Trade Payables Program_.

 

(a) The Factoring Entities do not own or hold any Transferred Assets other
than the Factored Receivables and do not hold any Assumed Liabilities. None
of the Factoring Entities shall be deemed to have any obligations hereunder,

Closing Date, Seller shall cause each Factoring Entity to enter into
the Factored Receivables Bill of Sale, pursuant to which such Factoring
Entity shall transfer to Buyer or any other Person designated by Buyer at
Closing the Factored Receivables.

the Closing pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Factored Receivables Bill of Sale.

(c) From and after April 1, 2019, Seller shall discontinue new originations

will use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, on a timely
basis, provide to Buyer all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer in
connection with the arrangement, marketing, syndication and consummation of
any financing deemed reasonably necessary or advisable by Buyer in connection
with the Transactions (including any customary debt securities offering to be
issued or incurred in lieu of all or a portion of any bridge facility, the
"Financing") ( _provided_ , _ however_, that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Seller or the
Business, it being acknowledged that the required cooperation set forth in the

cause any covenant, representation or warranty to be breached or to fail to
be satisfied or otherwise cause a breach of this Agreement), including:

sources (including the Lender Related Parties) for a reasonable number of
investor and lender meetings (including "road shows"), presentations and

agreed that Seller will not be required to provide any information relating to
(A) the proposed aggregate amount of debt and equity financing (if any),
together with assumed interest rates, dividends (if any) and fees and expenses
relating to the

 



52

    

 incurrence of such debt or equity financing; (B) any post-Closing or pro
forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other pro forma

expected to require the restatement of any financial statements of the
Business in order for such financial statements to comply with GAAP;

 

(iv) reasonably assisting Buyer with the preparation of materials for rating

thereof shall be conditioned upon, or become operative after, the occurrence
of the Closing, (C) neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
required to execute any document or instrument, or adopt any resolution or
other corporate action in respect of financing arrangement of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities) and (D) no Liability shall
be imposed on Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers or employees;

(vi) causing to be taken corporate and other actions by any Transferred Entity

such corporate or other action will only be required of the directors,
members, partners, managers or officers of the Transferred Entities who hold
such positions as of the Closing and will act in a similar capacity after the
Closing;

 



53

    

(vii) providing, as promptly as reasonably practicable but no later than

the financing sources (including the Lender Related Parties).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives (1) to
take any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate
any of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or
equivalent organizational documents) of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or
any Law, (2) to pay any commitment or similar fee, reimburse any third party
expenses, provide any indemnities in connection with any such Financing
(except to the extent Buyer promptly reimburses (in the case of out-of-pocket
costs) or provides the funding (in all other cases) to Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries therefor) or incur or assume any liability or obligation in
connection with the Financing, (3) to provide any information that would
violate any obligations of confidentiality or result in a violation of Law or
loss of any legal privilege. Buyer shall promptly upon written request by

following the Closing, remedy such breach as soon as practicable.

 



56

    

Section 6.16. _Commingled Entities_.

 

(a) Promptly following the Agreement Date, Seller and Buyer shall discuss in
good faith the manner in which the portion of the business of Wipro GE
Healthcare Private Ltd ("Wipro") Related to the Business (and the assets of

transitional arrangement with Seller pursuant to which (A) Buyer shall be
entitled to receive all products and services the Business currently receives
from Wipro, for a period of up to 24 months following Closing (or such shorter
period as may be required by applicable Law) on terms and conditions that are
at least as favorable to Buyer and its Affiliates as compared to Seller and
its Affiliates prior to the Agreement Date and (B) the cost to Buyer of the
continued provision of services to the Business by Wipro shall not exceed the
commissions charged to Business for the sale of the Business products under
the commission structure in effect on the Agreement Date between Seller and
Wipro.

 

(c) If the Business is conducted through a joint venture or comparable vehicle
(other than the Transferred Entities or Wipro) with an unaffiliated Person
(each, a "Commingled Entity") then, except as otherwise agreed to by the
Parties, the Parties shall treat each such Commingled Entity in the same
manner as Wipro described above.

 

Section 6.17. _Capex Budget_. Within seven Business Days of the Agreement
Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a capital expenditure budget for each
fiscal quarter of 2019 that shall (a) in the aggregate be equal to the annual
Capex Budget set forth on _Schedule 6.01(a)(xii)_ , (b) reflect Sellers good
faith estimate of the quarterly capital expenditure spending of the Business
for the applicable quarter and (c) be prepared consistent with past practice
and derived from the latest 2019 quarterly capital expenditure analysis as of

manner so as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party (including such
Persons successors, heirs and legal representatives) to whom this  _Section_
__ _ 7.03_ applies without the written consent of such affected DandO
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that, from and after the Closing,

the successors and assigns of Buyer or such Transferred Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_.

(d) The rights of the DandO Indemnified Parties under this  _Section_ __ _
7.03_ shall be in addition to any rights such DandO Indemnified Parties may have
under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other comparable
organizational documents of the Transferred Entities, or under any applicable
contracts or Laws, in each case in existence before the Agreement Date and
made available to Buyer (in the case of such rights under applicable
contracts, before the Closing), and from and after the Closing, Buyer shall
cause each Transferred Entity to, honor and perform under all indemnification
agreements entered into by such Transferred Entity, as applicable, as in
effect on the Agreement Date and made available to Buyer (in the case of
indemnification agreements, before the Closing).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in this _Section_ __ _
7.03_ (i) requires Buyer or any Transferred Entity to be liable for any
Excluded Liabilities or (ii) limits, modifies or in any way affects the
subrogation rights of, or rights to any insurance proceeds received by, Buyer
or any Transferred Entity pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 12.06_ and _Section_
__ _ 12.08_.

Section 7.04. _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Transferred Entities and the Business
shall cease to be in any manner insured by, entitled to any benefits or
coverage under or entitled to seek benefits or coverage from or under any
Insurance Policies other than (i) any Insurance Policy issued in the name and
for the benefit of any Transferred Entity, the Business or any
DandO Indemnified Party; (ii) with respect to any matters covered by an
Insurance Policy that are properly reported to the relevant insurer(s) prior

concluding on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, solely under the
Available Insurance Policies, for any losses or Claims arising from or based
on any fact, circumstance, occurrence, act or omission that occurred or
existed prior to the Closing, in each case of clauses (i) through (iii),
subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant Insurance Policies and
this Agreement, except to the extent otherwise mandated by Law. "Available
Insurance Policies" means Insurance Policies maintained by Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to or as of the Closing Date that by their terms cover
Losses, acts and omissions of the

 



61

    

 Business, the Transferred Entities or any DandO Indemnified Party occurring
prior to the Closing and permit the applicable Claims as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 7.04_. The Transferred Entities shall, and Seller shall
reasonably assist Buyer and the Transferred Entities to, procure all
contractual and statutorily obligated insurance at Closing.

 

(b) The rights of the Business, the Transferred Entities or any DandO
Indemnified Party under subparagraphs (a) _(ii)_ and (a) _(iii)_
(collectively, "Available Insurance Claims") are subject to and conditioned
upon the following:

(i) The Transferred Entities shall be solely responsible for notifying any
and all insurance companies of such Claims and complying with all policy terms
and conditions for pursuit and collection of such Claims; _provided_ that
Seller shall promptly forward to Buyer or the applicable Transferred Entity
any communication from an insurer in respect of such Claims and, to the extent
applicable, reasonably assist Buyers or the applicable Transferred Entitys
communications with an insurer. The Transferred Entities shall not, without
the written consent of Seller, amend, modify or waive any rights of Seller or
other insureds (other than any Transferred Entity or the Business) under any
such insurance policies and programs. The Transferred Entities and the
Business shall exclusively bear and be liable (and Seller shall have no
obligation to repay or reimburse the Transferred Entities or the Business) for
all uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or uncollectible amounts relating to or
associated with all such Claims; and

(ii) With respect to Claims or requests for benefits asserted by the
Transferred Entities under the Available Insurance Policies, subject to the
proviso in the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 7.04(b)(i)_, Seller shall
have the right but not the duty to monitor and/or associate with such Claims.
The Transferred Entities shall be liable for any out-of-pocket fees, costs
and expenses incurred by Seller directly, or indirectly through the insurers
or reinsurers of the Available Insurance Policies, relating to any
unsuccessful coverage Claims. The Transferred Entities shall not assign any
Available Insurance Policies or any rights or Claims under the Available
Insurance Policies.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, (i) nothing in this
Agreement shall limit, waive or abrogate in any manner any rights of Seller
to insurance coverage for any matter and (ii) Seller shall retain the
exclusive right to control its Insurance Policies, including the right to
exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy-back or otherwise resolve disputes
with respect to any of its Insurance Policies and to amend, modify or waive
any rights under any such Insurance Policies as long as such action is not
taken with the primary purpose to reduce the insurance coverage
for Liabilities or losses as to which any Transferred Entity or the Business
has made, or could in the future make, a Claim for coverage; _provided_ , that
the Transferred Entities and Seller shall cooperate with respect to coverage
Claims and requests for benefits and sharing such information as is
reasonably necessary in order to permit (x) Buyer and the Transferred Entities
to seek the Available Insurance Claims and (y) Seller to manage and conduct
its insurance matters.

  



62

    

(d) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ shall limit, modify or in any way
affect the rights and obligations of the Parties under _Article VIII_ or
Buyers right to acquire the Transferred Assets in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any insurance
proceeds actually collected with respect to a particular Loss shall be taken
into account in accordance with and to the extent required by _Section_ __ _
12.06_. No payments due under this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ shall affect, be
affected by, or be subject to set off against, any adjustment to the Purchase
Price. Whenever this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ requires any Transferred Entity to
take any action after the Closing, such requirement shall be deemed to
constitute an undertaking on the part of Buyer to take such action or to cause
such Transferred Entity to take such action. If Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries receives insurance proceeds in connection with any Available
Insurance Claim to which Buyer is entitled pursuant to the rights set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 7.04(a)_ and _(b)_ , Seller shall cause such proceeds to
which Buyer is entitled to be promptly delivered to the applicable Transferred
Entity or another Person designated by Buyer.

Section 7.05. _[_ _Reserved.]_

 

Section 7.06. _Further Assurances_. From time to time following the Closing,
Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
execute, acknowledge and deliver all reasonable further conveyances, notices,
assumptions, releases and acquittances and such instruments, and shall take
such reasonable actions as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to make
effective the transactions contemplated hereby as may be reasonably requested
by the other Party (including (i) transferring back to Seller or its
designated Subsidiary (and having Seller or its designated Subsidiary assume)
(A) each Excluded Asset and each Excluded Liability transferred by a Seller
Party to Buyer (directly or as an asset or Liability of any Transferred
Entity) at the Closing and (B) any Excluded Asset that is transferred or paid
to Buyer or its Affiliates by a third party after the Closing and (ii)
transferring to Buyer or its designated Subsidiary (and having Buyer or its

Liability that was not transferred by a Seller Party to Buyer (directly or as
an asset or Liability of any Transferred Entity) at the Closing and (B) any
Transferred Asset that is transferred or paid to Seller or its Affiliates by a
third party after the Closing);  _provided_ , _however_ , that except for
Buyers obligations to discharge an Assumed Liability and Sellers obligations
to discharge an Excluded Liability, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_
shall require either Party or its Affiliates to pay money to, commence or
participate in any Action with respect to, or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to, any third party following the Closing.

 

Section 7.07. _Further Action Regarding Intellectual Property_ _and
Technology_.

 

(a) If, after the Closing Date, Seller or Buyer identifies any item of Company
Intellectual Property or Company Technology that inadvertently was not
previously transferred by a Seller Party to Buyer, then, Seller shall (or
shall cause a Seller party to) promptly transfer such Company Intellectual
Property or Company Technology to Buyer for no additional consideration. Until
such time that Seller Party transfers such Company Intellectual Property or
Company Technology to Buyer, such Seller Party, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, hereby grants to Buyer and its Subsidiaries (i) a non-exclusive,
royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, irrevocable, sub-licensable and
transferable right and license (or sub-license, as the case may be) to fully
use, practice and otherwise exploit such Company Intellectual Property or
Company Technology Controlled (as such term is defined in the Intellectual
Property Cross License Agreement) by the Seller Party and its Affiliates and
(ii) a covenant not to sue with respect to the foregoing activities, in each
case under clauses (i) and (ii), effective as of the Closing Date.

 



63

    

(b) If, after the Closing Date, Seller or Buyer identifies any item of Seller
Intellectual Property or Seller Technology that was (i) transferred by a
Seller Party or (ii) owned by any Transferred Entity prior to the Closing Date
and that was not transferred to Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller prior to
the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the applicable Transferred
Entity to, promptly transfer such Seller Intellectual Property or Seller
Technology to Seller or its designated Subsidiary for no additional
consideration. Until such time that Buyer transfers such Seller Intellectual
Property or Seller Technology to Seller, Buyer hereby grants to Seller and its
Subsidiaries (i) a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide,
irrevocable, sub-licensable and transferable right and license (or sub-
license, as the case may be) to fully use, practice and otherwise exploit such
Seller Intellectual Property or Seller Technology Controlled (as such term is
defined in the Intellectual Property Cross License Agreement) by Buyer and
(ii) a covenant not to sue with respect to the foregoing activities, in each
case under clauses (i) and (ii), effective as of the Closing Date.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, if, prior to the Closing Date, Seller or
Buyer identifies any item of Seller Intellectual Property, Seller Technology,
Company Intellectual Property or Company Technology that inadvertently was
listed or omitted on a Schedule of Company Intellectual Property or Company
Technology, then such Schedule shall be deemed amended to remove or add such
item, as applicable.

Section 7.08. _Local Transfer Agreements_.

 

(a) The parties do not intend this Agreement to transfer title to any
Transferred Equity Interests or Transferred Assets, or to constitute
the assumption of any Assumed Liabilities, in any jurisdiction in which such
transfer or assumption is required by applicable Law to be made pursuant to a
Local Transfer Agreement, and any such Transferred Equity Interests or
Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities, as applicable, shall only be
transferred or assumed by the applicable Local Transfer Agreement (which
transfers and assumptions shall, except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein, be on an "as-is", "where-is" basis, without representation or
warranty of any kind or nature). The Local Transfer Agreements shall serve
purely to effect the legal transfer of the applicable Transferred Equity
Interests or Transferred Assets, or the assumption of any Assumed Liabilities
in the applicable jurisdictions, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Local
Transfer Agreements shall not have any effect on the value being given or
received by the Seller Parties or Buyer, including the allocation of assets
and Liabilities as between them, all of which shall be determined solely in
accordance with this Agreement; in any such case except as expressly agreed
in writing by Buyer and Seller (and not any Affiliates thereof).

(b) Without limiting the generality of  _Section_ __ _ 7.08(a)_, to the
extent that the provisions of a Local Transfer Agreement are inconsistent
with, or (except to the extent they implement a transfer in accordance with
this Agreement) additional to, the provisions of this Agreement (or do not
fully give effect to the provisions of this Agreement with respect to the
transfer of the Transferred Equity Interests, Transferred Assets or the
assumption of Assumed Liabilities): (i) the provisions of this
Agreement shall prevail; and (ii) so far as permissible under applicable Law
of the relevant jurisdiction, the Seller Parties and Buyer shall cause the
provisions of the relevant Local Transfer Agreement to be adjusted, to the
extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement.

 



64

    

(c) Each party hereto shall not, and shall cause its respective Affiliates not
to, bring any Claim (including for breach of any warranty, representation,
undertaking, covenant or indemnity relating to the Transactions) against the
other party or any of its Affiliates in respect of or based upon any of the
Local Transfer Agreements, except to the extent necessary to enforce any
transfer of the Transferred Equity Interests, Transferred Assets or the
assumption of Assumed Liabilities sold or assigned to Buyer hereunder in a
manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement. All such Claims (except
as referred to above) shall be brought in accordance with, and be subject to
the provisions, rights and limitations set out in, this Agreement, and no
party shall be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment,
reimbursement, restitution or indemnity under or pursuant to any of the Local
Transfer Agreements (but without prejudice to the establishment of the
existence of the Claim hereunder) to the extent inconsistent with this
Agreement.

 

Section 7.09. _Non-Competition_. With respect to non-competition matters,
Buyer and Seller have made the agreements and covenants set forth in _Exhibit
D_ to this Agreement, which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

 

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 9.01. _Filing of Tax Returns by Seller_.

 

(a) Seller shall, at Sellers cost and expense, (i) timely prepare and file
(or cause to be timely prepared and filed) all Tax Returns that are required
to be filed by or with respect to each Transferred Entity on an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary basis with Seller or with at least one
Subsidiary of Seller that is not a Transferred Entity for Tax years
or periods beginning on or before the Closing Date and (ii) timely prepare
and file (or cause to be timely prepared and filed) all other Tax Returns
required to be filed by any Transferred Entity with a due date (taking into
account extensions to file such returns) on or before the Closing Date.

(b) Any Tax Return prepared by Seller pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(a)_
(i) that includes the Closing Date shall reflect a deduction for the
Transaction Deductions (unless otherwise reflected on a corresponding Tax
Return of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries other than a Transferred Entity)
and (ii) shall, to the extent that such Tax Return shows a net operating loss
of any Transferred Entity, carry back such net operating loss to previous Tax
periods to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



65

    

(c) With respect to each Tax Return prepared and filed by Seller pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 9.01(a)_, Seller shall timely remit (or cause to be timely
remitted) any and all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns to the extent
that Taxes are required to be remitted upon filing such Tax Returns, except to
the extent such Taxes were taken into account in the calculation of Purchase
Price (as finalized pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04_), which Taxes shall be
remitted by Buyer (or its applicable Affiliate) to Seller within five (5)
Business Days of filing such Tax Return. In the event that the amount of Taxes
taken into account in calculating Purchase Price (as finalized pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.04_) exceeds the actual Tax liability reflected on such Tax
Return, Buyer (or its applicable Affiliate) shall remit such excess to Seller
within five (5) Business Days of filing such Tax Return.

 

Section 9.02. _Filing of Tax Returns by Buyer_.

 

(a) Except for the Tax Returns described in _Section_ __ _ 9.01(a)_, Buyer
shall, at Buyers cost and expense, timely prepare and file (or cause to be
timely prepared and filed) all Tax Returns of the Transferred Entities. If
such Tax Returns or, in the case of clause (ii), Tax Returns of a JV reflect
(i) any Taxes for which indemnification may be claimed from Seller pursuant
to _Article XII_ or (ii) Taxes with respect to which a Transferred Entity or a
JV is treated as a pass-through entity and which Taxes flow through to Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than a Transferred Entity or JV), then: (A)
subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.02(b)_, Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared) such Tax Returns in accordance with past practices of the Business
to the extent that there is at least a "more likely than not" basis for such
past practices under applicable Tax Law, (B) completed drafts of such Tax
Returns, and, in the case of any Tax Return for a Straddle Period, a _pro
forma_ Tax Return for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date, shall be submitted to Seller for Sellers review not later than
30 days before the due date for filing such Tax Returns (or, if such due date
is within 45 days following the Closing Date, as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date), (C) Seller shall have the right to
review and approve (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) each such Tax Return delivered to it before the filing thereof and
(D) to the extent relating to the matters described in either clause (i) or
clause (ii) of this _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)_, Buyer shall make any changes to
such Tax Returns reasonably requested by Seller at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the prior to the due date of such Tax Return and provide such
amended Tax Return to the Seller at least ten (10) days before the Tax Return
is due. Seller shall, at least two (2) days before any Tax Return that Buyer
is obligated to file under this _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)_ is due, pay Buyer
(or its Subsidiary) the amount of Taxes shown as due thereon to the extent
Seller is liable for such Taxes pursuant to _Article XII_ , except to the
extent such Taxes were taken into account in the calculation of Purchase
Price (as finalized pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04_). In the event that the
amount of Taxes taken into account in calculating Purchase Price (as finalized
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.04_) exceeds the portion of the actual Tax
liability reflected on such Tax Return for which Seller is liable pursuant to
_Article XII_ , Buyer (or its applicable Affiliate) shall remit such excess to
Seller within five (5) Business Days of filing such Tax Return.

 



66

    

(b) Any income Tax Return prepared by Buyer pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
9.02(a)_ (i) that includes the Closing Date shall reflect a deduction for the
Transaction Deductions (unless otherwise reflected on a corresponding Tax
Return of Seller or any of its Affiliates other than a Transferred Entity)
and (ii) shall, to the extent that such Tax Return shows a net operating loss
of any Transferred Entity, carry back such net operating loss to previous Tax
periods to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(c) Except upon Sellers request pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.05_, neither
Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause or permit any
Transferred Entity to) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an
extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return
relating in whole or in part to any Transferred Entity (or a group the parent
of which is a Transferred Entity) with respect to any taxable year or period
(or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (or with respect to
any Straddle Period) without the prior written consent of Seller, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 9.03. _Straddle Periods_. To the extent possible under applicable Law,
the parties shall take such actions as shall be necessary or appropriate to
cause the taxable year of each Transferred Entity and JV to end on the Closing
Date. For all purposes under this Agreement, including, for the avoidance of
doubt,  _Section_ __ _ 2.01_, in the case of any Tax period that includes
but does not end on the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the portion of
Taxes (or any Tax refund or amount credited against any Tax) that
are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending at the end of the
Closing Date will be: (i) in the case of property Taxes and other Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis without regard to income, gross receipts, payroll,
sales or any specific transaction or event deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes (or Tax refund or amount credited against Tax) for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of such Straddle Period ending at the end of the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, including
Taxes attributable to the ownership of JV interest or any Transferred Entity
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a "pass-through" entity or
"controlled foreign corporation" (within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the
Code or any comparable state, local or non-U.S. Applicable Law), determined
as though the taxable year terminated at the end of the Closing Date. Any
Transaction Deductions shall be reflected in the portion of any Straddle
Period ending at the end of the Closing Date.

Section 9.04. _Tax Proceedings_.

 

(a) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing and for the avoidance of
doubt, any Transferred Entity) of any written communication from a Taxing
Authority concerning any pending or threatened audit, Claim, demand, proposed
adjustment or deficiency, assessment or administrative or judicial proceeding
(a "Tax Claim") described in clause (A), (B) or (C) of _Section_ __ _
9.04(a)_ and to the extent known, describing in reasonable detail the facts
and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such Tax Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of Buyer to provide such notice
shall not release Seller from any of its obligations under this Agreement
except to the extent Seller is actually prejudiced by such failure.

 



67

    

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.06(b)_, Seller shall have the
exclusive right to (i) prepare (or cause to be prepared) any amended Tax
Returns and (ii) control any Tax Claim, in each case to the extent that any
such Tax Return or Tax Claim (A) relates to any taxable year or period ending
on or before the Closing Date, (B) could reasonably be expected to result in
any Tax Liability with respect to which Seller has agreed to provide
indemnification under this Agreement or (C) relates to Taxes with respect to
which a Transferred Entity or JV is treated as a pass-through entity and
which Taxes flow through to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than a
Transferred Entity or JV). Subject to the immediately succeeding sentence,
upon Sellers request, Buyer shall file (or shall cause to be filed) any
amended Tax Return described in the immediately preceding sentence and shall
execute any powers of attorney or similar documents that may be required to
effectuate the intent of this _Section_ __ _ 9.04(b)_. Except for Taxes paid
on an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary basis with Seller or its
Affiliates, Seller shall not settle any Tax Claim or file (or cause to be
filed) any amended Tax Return pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.04(b)_
without Buyers consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. In the case of any Tax Claim or amended Tax Return controlled by
Seller pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.04(a)_, Seller shall (x) notify
Buyer of any material development with respect to any such Tax Claim or
amended Tax Return, (y) provide Buyer with copies of any material documents
submitted in connection with such Tax Claim or amended Tax Return and (z)
notify Buyer regarding any material action to be taken by Seller with respect
to such Tax Claim or amended Tax Return.

 

Section 9.05. _Refunds_. Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Seller any
Tax refunds that are actually received by any Transferred Entity (or Buyer or
any Affiliate of Buyer on any Transferred Entitys behalf), and any amounts
credited against Tax to which any Transferred Entity (or Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer on any Transferred Entitys behalf) becomes entitled, in
each case, (i) that relate to Tax periods (or portions of a Straddle Period)
ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) except to the extent any such
refund (x) arises as a result of carryback of loss or other Tax Benefit from
a period beginning after the Closing Date or (y) was taken into account in the
calculation of Purchase Price (as finalized pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.04_), and (iii) net of costs and expenses incurred by the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, including Taxes, with respect to such refunds of Taxes. Buyer
shall file (or cause to be filed), at the cost and expense of the Seller
Parties, all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns) claiming any
refunds, including through the carryback of any net operating losses that are
attributable to a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, to which
Seller is entitled pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. Any
payments required to be made under this _Section_ __ _ 9.05_ shall be made
in immediately available funds, to an account or accounts as directed by
Seller, within five days of the receipt of the refund or the application of
any such refunds as a credit against Tax for which Seller has not otherwise
agreed to provide indemnification under this Agreement. For purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 9.05_, Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall be treated as
becoming entitled to a credit in lieu of cash Taxes only if, when and to the
extent that such credit is actually utilized on a Tax Return filed by the
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 9.05_, any refunds or credits of
Creditable VAT which is the responsibility of the Buyer pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.07_ shall be for the benefit of the Buyer.

 



68

    

Section 9.06. _Post-Closing Actions_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise required by applicable law, Buyer shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing for the
avoidance of doubt, the Transferred Entities) to (i) voluntarily approach any
Taxing Authority regarding any Taxes or Tax Returns of any Transferred Entity
relating to any Tax period (or portions of a Straddle Period) ending on
or before the Closing Date, (ii) take any action relating to Taxes, or that
could create a Tax Liability, on the Closing Date after the Closing that is
outside the ordinary course of business (other than as expressly contemplated
by this Agreement) or (iii) except as provided by _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)_ or
upon Sellers request pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.05_, carryback any net
operating losses from any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending after the
Closing Date to any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date, in each case without the prior written consent of Seller.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, amend any Tax Return of a Person
other than a Transferred Entity to the extent that such amendment could
materially adversely affect the Tax liability of any Transferred Entity in a
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, through the utilization of any net
operating loss, tax credit, or other similar tax attribute of a Transferred
Entity), in each case without the prior written consent of Buyer, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 9.07. _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Transfer Taxes imposed or arising with respect to the sale
and purchase hereunder of Transferred Assets and Transferred Equity Interests
(including any Transfer Taxes imposed or arising in connection with
transactions contemplated by _Schedule 2.06_ or otherwise in connection with
_Section_ __ _ 2.06_, but excluding any Pre-Closing Restructuring Taxes),
shall be borne 50% by the Seller Parties and 50% by the Buyer, except for any
Creditable VAT, which shall be borne 100% by the Buyer. The Party required by
Law to file a Tax Return with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall timely
prepare, with the other Partys cooperation, file such Tax Return and pay all
Taxes reflected on every Tax Return, and the other Party shall promptly
reimburse the Party required by Law to file such tax return for its share of
any Transfer Taxes paid by it in connection with the filing of such Tax
Return. Buyer and Seller each agree to timely sign and deliver (or to cause
to be timely signed and delivered) such certificates or forms as may be
necessary or appropriate and otherwise to cooperate to establish any available
exemption from (or otherwise reduce) any such Transfer Taxes (which
shall include cooperating to treat the sale and purchase of Transferred
Assets as the transfer of a going concern for value added tax purposes where
such treatment is possible and agreeing to take all reasonably necessary steps
for such treatment to apply).

Section 9.08. _Tax Sharing Agreements_. To the extent relating to a
Transferred Entity, Seller shall terminate (or cause to be terminated) on or
before the Closing Date all Tax sharing agreements or arrangements (other than
this Agreement) among the Transferred Entities, on the one hand, and Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities), on the other
hand, such that neither Seller nor any such Subsidiary, on the one hand, or
any of the Transferred Entities, on the other hand, will have any Liability or
entitlement to any right thereunder to each other on or after the Closing
Date.

 



69

    

Section 9.09. _Tax Cooperation_. Without limiting the obligations set forth
in  _Sections_ __ _ 6.02_ and _7.01_ , the Parties shall furnish or cause to
be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to the Transferred Entities,
their respective assets or businesses and the Transferred Assets (including
access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all
Tax Returns, the making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for,
or the prosecution or defense of, any Tax Claim. The Parties shall cooperate
with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding related to
Taxes and all other Tax matters relating to the Transferred Entities or their
respective assets or businesses and each shall execute and deliver such
powers of attorney and other documents and shall make employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of
any material provided hereunder or to testify at related Tax Claim
proceedings as are necessary to carry out the intent of this _Article IX_.
Each of the Parties agrees that it shall preserve and keep, or cause to be
preserved and kept, all original books and records in respect of the Business
relating to any Taxes with respect to Taxable years or periods (in whole or
in part) ending on or before the Closing Date and in the possession of such
Party or any of its Affiliates in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.01_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement
shall permit or be deemed to permit a Party or any of its Affiliates or
representatives to review or otherwise have access to any affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return that includes the other Party or
any of its Affiliates (other than Tax Returns that relate solely to the
Transferred Entities).

 

Section 9.10. _Section_ __ _ 338_ _Elections_. Subject to _Section_ __ _
2.06_, Buyer shall not make (or permit to be made) an election under Section
338(g) of the Code (or any comparable applicable provision of state, local or
foreign Law) with respect to the acquisition of any Transferred Entity.

 

Section 9.11. _Section_ __ _ 754_ _Elections_. Seller Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of the Transferred Entities and
JVs that are treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes to
have an effective election under Section 754 of the Code (or any comparable
applicable provision of state, local or foreign law) in effect for the
taxable year that includes the Closing Date.

Section 9.12. _Swedish Tax Matters_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in no event shall the Seller Parties or their respective Affiliates
(i) utilize any net operating loss, tax credit or other tax attribute of any
Swedish Transferred Entity to reduce, offset or eliminate any Tax of
any person other than a Swedish Transferred Entity, (ii) following the date
hereof, utilize any net operating loss, tax credit or other tax attribute of
any Swedish Transferred Entity to reduce, offset or eliminate any Tax of any
Person in connection with any Tax Claim (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Tax of any Swedish Transferred Entity), or (iii) assign, transfer,
or otherwise convey any taxable income, tax liability or other similar tax
item to a Swedish Transferred Entity from a Seller Party or any other Person
that is not a Swedish Transferred Entity.

Section 9.13. _Survival_. The indemnity and payment obligations set forth in
this _Article IX_ or _Article XII_ with respect to Taxes shall survive until
the date that is 30 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of

doubt, the knowing and material breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ by either
Party or impair the right of any Party (prior to the termination of this
Agreement) to compel specific performance by any other Party of its
obligations under this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.15_).

 

ARTICLE XII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 12.01. _Survival_. The representations and warranties of Seller and
Buyer contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate and not
survive and be of no further force and effect from and after the Closing Date,
and no party to this Agreement shall have any Liability with respect thereto
from and after the Closing. The covenants in this Agreement that by their
terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part prior to the Closing
shall survive in full force and effect until the date that is one year after
the Closing Date, at which time they shall terminate and no claims shall be
made for indemnification with respect thereto under _Section_ __ _ 12.02_ or
_12.03_ thereafter. The covenants in this Agreement that contemplate
performance at or following the Closing Date shall survive in accordance with
their terms, after which such covenants shall terminate and no claims shall
be made for indemnification with respect thereto under _Section_ __ _ 12.02_
or _Section_ __ _ 12.03_ thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, if notice
of any covenant breach has been given to an Indemnifying Party prior to the
time that such covenant would otherwise terminate hereunder, such claim shall
survive until it is finally resolved.

Indemnified Party may suffer or incur, or become subject to, without
duplication as a result of:

 

(i) prior to their expiration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.01_ (to
the extent applicable), any breach or failure by Seller to perform any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

(ii) any Excluded Liability; or

 

(iii) (A) any Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) imposed on any Transferred

1.1502-6(a) (or under any similar provision of Law), (B) any Taxes (other than
Transfer Taxes) imposed on a Transferred Entity, including Taxes of any Person

ending on and including the Closing Date (D) any Pre-Closing Restructuring
Taxes and (E) Transfer Taxes for which Seller is responsible pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.07_ (collectively, "Pre-Closing Taxes"); _provided_ that
for purposes of this Article XII, Pre-Closing Taxes shall be calculated
without taking into account any net operating loss, tax credit or other tax
attribute of the Swedish Transferred Entities otherwise available to reduce,
offset or eliminate such Pre-Closing Tax.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

 

(i) the cumulative indemnification obligation of Seller under _Article XII_
(other than _Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)(ii)_) shall in no event exceed 100% of
the Purchase Price;

(ii) Seller shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless any
Buyer Indemnified Party for any Losses reflected in the Final Closing
Statement;

(iii) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not have any right to
indemnification under this Agreement with respect to, or based on, Taxes to
the extent such Taxes (A) are attributable to Tax periods (or portions
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, (B) result from transactions or
actions taken by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Transferred Entities) outside the ordinary course of business on
the Closing Date after the Closing except to the extent such transactions or
actions are specifically contemplated by this Agreement or are required by
applicable Law or (C) were taken into account in calculating the Purchase
Price (as finalized pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04_), as adjusted for
payments from Buyer (or its applicable Affiliate) to Seller pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)_ or the final sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)_;
and

 



74

    

(iv) Without limiting the rights and remedies of the applicable Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to their Losses arising from, as a result of
or related to the JVs, (A) none of the JVs shall be Buyer Indemnified Parties
and (B) to the extent that any Claim is made pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
12.02(a)(iii)(A)_ that arises out of or relates to Taxes imposed on a JV,
Sellers Liability hereunder for any Losses resulting therefrom shall be
limited to the Buyer Indemnified Parties proportionate share of such Losses
based on Buyers percentage ownership interest in such JV, as applicable,
represented by the JV Interests in such JV, as applicable, sold to Buyer
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 2.06_, as
applicable.

Section 12.03. _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, and subject to the terms of this Agreement,
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") against, and

Indemnified Party may suffer or incur, or become subject to as a result of:

 

(i) prior to their expiration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.01_ (to
the extent applicable), any breach or failure by Buyer to perform any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

(ii) any Assumed Liability; or

 

(iii) (A) any Taxes that such Seller Indemnified Party may be liable for or
incur, or become subject to, as a result of any Taxes imposed in respect of a
Transferred Entity, or with respect to the Business, with respect to any Tax
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date and (B) any Taxes
that result from transactions or actions taken by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Transferred
Entities) outside the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date after
the Closing except to the extent such transactions or actions are specifically
contemplated by this Agreement or are required by applicable Law and (C) any
Taxes for which Buyer is liable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.07_, _Section_
__ _ 9.01(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the cumulative

_Section_ __ _ 12.03(a)(ii)_) shall in no event exceed 100% of the Purchase

Section 12.04.  _Notification of Claims_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Person that may be
entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party"),
shall promptly notify the Party liable for such indemnification (the
"Indemnifying Party") in writing of any pending or threatened Claim, demand or
circumstance that the Indemnified Party has determined has given or would
reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under this
Agreement (including a pending or threatened Claim or demand asserted by a
third party against 

 



75

    

 the Indemnified Party, such Claim being a "Third Party Claim"), describing
in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such Claim, demand or circumstance; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party
from any of its obligations under this _Article XII_ except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure.

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Claim for indemnity from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 12.04(a)_ with respect to any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim and, in the event that
the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of such Claim, it shall allow
the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_
__ _ 12.04_, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim (and, to the extent the Indemnifying Party
has assumed the defense, shall transfer control of such defense to the
Indemnified Party) if (i) such Third Party Claim seeks equitable relief or
involves a criminal Action or (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not have
assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days of
receipt of a notice of such Claim for indemnity. If the Indemnifying Party
shall assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim, (x) the Indemnifying
Party shall select, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense,
counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing and competence
after consultation with the Indemnified Party (and in each case subject to
approval by the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld)
and shall take all steps reasonably necessary in the defense or, to the
extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 12.04(c)_, settlement of such Third Party
Claim and (y) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its
sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ that the fees, costs and expenses of one such counsel shall
be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party are both named parties to the proceedings and the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
and Representatives to, cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense, in the defense of any Third Party
Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to a settlement of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, without the consent
of any Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
_provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party may agree to the settlement of, or
the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim without the
Indemnified Partys consent if it (i) does not include an injunction or other
equitable remedy adversely affecting or encumbering any material assets of
the Indemnified Parties, their respective Affiliates or the Business, (ii)
does not involve criminal liability or any admission of wrongdoing, (iii)
involves only the payment of monetary damages and the Indemnifying Party pays
all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment (subject to _Section_
__ _ 12.02(b)_, if applicable) and (iv) includes, as a condition of such
settlement or judgment, a complete release of any Indemnified Party
potentially affected by such Third Party Claim.

 



76

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no direct
Claim may be made by any Buyer Indemnified Party for Taxes pursuant to this
Agreement, and in the event of a conflict between this _Section_ __ _ 12.04_
and _Section_ __ _ 9.04_ with respect to the procedures governing a Claim
for indemnification involving Taxes, the procedures set forth in _Section_ __
_ 9.04_ will control.

Section 12.05.  _Exclusive Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth
in this Agreement and without limiting any right or obligation under any other
Transaction Agreements, including _Section_ __ _ 3.05_ and  _Section_ __ _
13.15_, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this _Article
XII_ (and, in the case of any Buyer Indemnified Party, the RandW Policy) shall
be the sole and exclusive remedies of any Seller Indemnified Party and any
Buyer Indemnified Party, respectively, for any Losses (including any Losses
from Claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including
negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law,
statute, strict Liability or otherwise) that it may at any time suffer or
incur, or become subject to, as a result of, or in connection with, this
Agreement or the Transactions, except in the case of Fraud. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Parties hereby irrevocably waive any
right of rescission they may otherwise have or to which they may become
entitled.

 

Section 12.06. _Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

 

(a) With respect to each indemnification obligation contained in this
Agreement: (i) each such obligation shall be reduced by any Tax benefit
actually realized in cash by the Indemnified Party during the taxable period
in which such Loss arises or any of the three succeeding taxable periods
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax benefit that represents only
an acceleration of the timing with respect to which a loss, deduction, or
other tax attribute is taken into account rather than a Tax benefit that
results in permanent reduction in Tax Liability), (ii) all Losses shall be net
of any amounts (less Recovery Expenses) that have been recovered by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification by, or indemnification
agreement with, any third party or any insurance policy or other cash receipts
or sources of reimbursement in respect of such Loss, (ii) all Losses shall be
net of any amounts (less Recovery Expenses) that have been recovered by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification by, or indemnification
agreement with, any third party or any insurance policy or other cash
receipts or sources of reimbursement in respect of such Loss, (iii) all Losses
will be determined after deducting therefrom the amount of any reserve with
respect to such matter on the Final Closing Statement and (iv) Seller shall
not be liable for any Losses to the extent that such Losses suffered by any
Buyer Indemnified Party (A) result from the failure of such Buyer Indemnified
Party to take reasonable action to mitigate such Losses, (B) are taken into
account in the calculation of Final Working Capital, or (C) are caused by or
result from any action taken at the request of Buyer.

(b) If an Indemnifying Party makes any payment for any Losses suffered or
incurred by an Indemnified Party pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
XII_ , such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance
benefits or other Claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses
and with respect to the Claim giving rise to such Losses, in each case, to the
extent permitted by the applicable insurance policies.

 



77

    

Section 12.07. _Mitigation_. Each Party shall, and shall cause its
applicable Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) and
Representatives to, take reasonable steps to mitigate their respective Losses
upon and after becoming aware of any fact, event, circumstance or condition
that has given rise to or would reasonably be expected to give rise to, any
Losses for which it would have the right to seek indemnification hereunder.

Section 12.08. _Third Party Remedies_. If any Buyer Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates is at any time entitled (whether by reason of a contractual
right, a right to take or bring an Action, availability of insurance, or a
right to require a payment discount or otherwise) to recover from another
Person any amount in respect of any matter giving rise to a Loss that is
indemnifiable hereunder (whether before or after Seller has made a payment to
any Buyer Indemnified Party hereunder and in respect thereof), in each case
other than with respect to the RandW Policy, Buyer shall (and shall cause its
applicable Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) and Representatives
to) (a) promptly notify Seller and provide such information as Seller may
require relating to such right of recovery and the steps taken or to be taken
by Buyer in connection therewith, (b) if so required by Seller (subject to
Buyer being indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by Seller against all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in respect
thereof) and before being entitled to recover any amount from Seller under
this Agreement, first take such reasonable steps (whether by making a claim
against its insurers, commencement of an Action or otherwise) as Seller may
reasonably require to pursue such recovery and (c) keep Seller fully informed
of the progress of any action taken in respect thereof. Thereafter, any claim
against Seller shall be limited (in addition to the other limitations on
Sellers Liability referred to in this Agreement) to the amount by which the
Losses suffered by Buyer Indemnified Party exceed the amounts so recovered by
Buyer Indemnified Party or any such Affiliate, net of Recovery Expenses. If
Buyer Indemnified Parties recover any amounts in respect of Losses from any
third party at any time after Seller has paid all or a portion of such Losses
to Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to the provisions of this _Article XII_
, Buyer shall, or shall cause such Buyer Indemnified Parties to, promptly (and
in any event within five (5) Business Days after receipt) pay over to Seller
the amount so received (to the extent previously paid by Seller) net of
Recovery Expenses, provided that no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be required
to first seek recovery from an insurer or any other Person prior to seeking
and obtaining recovery from the Indemnifying Party. The provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 12.08_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to claims of a Seller
Indemnified Party.

 

Section 12.09. _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement or in any other Transaction Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall either Party have any Liability under any Transaction Agreement
(including under this _Article XII_ ) for any punitive damages (except to the
extent actually awarded and payable to any third party).

 

Section 12.10. _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Seller and Buyer shall treat any
adjustments or indemnity payments made pursuant to this Agreement as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for income Tax purposes unless applicable
Tax Law causes such payment not to be so treated.

 



78

    

Section 12.11. _Representation and Warranty Insurance_. If Buyer or any of
its Affiliates procures a representation and warranty insurance policy (or
other similar policy) (a "RandW Policy"), then (i) such RandW Policy shall be at
Buyers sole expense and (ii) Buyer shall cause such RandW Policy to expressly
include a waiver by the insurer of any and all subrogation rights against
Seller and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors and
employees (other than arising from Fraud). Buyer shall cause each insured
party under any such RandW Policy not to waive, amend, modify or otherwise
revise such subrogation provision, or allow such provision to be waived,
amended, modified or otherwise revised in a manner that is adverse to Seller
without the prior written consent of Seller. Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer with respect to Buyers procurement of any such RandW
Policy.

Section 13.04. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement of each Party shall be reasonably agreed
upon by the other Party. Neither Party or any Affiliate or Representative of
either Party shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or
public announcement or otherwise communicate with any news media in respect
of the Transaction Agreements or the Transactions without the prior written
consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except (a) as a Party believes in good faith and
based on reasonable advice of counsel is required by applicable Law or by
applicable rules of any stock exchange or quotation system on which such Party
or its Affiliates lists or trades securities (in which case the disclosing
Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) advise the other
Party before making such disclosure and (ii) provide such other Party a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such release or announcement
and consider in good faith any comments with respect thereto) or (b) a Party
may make such public disclosures that are consistent with prior disclosures
made in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 13.04_ or any communication
plan or strategy previously agreed to by the Parties.

Section 13.05. _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement
is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable
Law, as a matter of public policy or on any other grounds, the validity,
legality and enforceability of all other terms and provisions of this
Agreement will not in any way be affected or impaired. If the final judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction or other Government Authority declares
that any term or provision hereof is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
Parties agree that the court making such determination will have the power to
reduce the scope, duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, illegal or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid, legal
and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision.

 

Section 13.06. _Assignment_. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and permitted
assigns of the Parties. Neither Party may assign (whether by operation of Law
or otherwise) this Agreement or any rights, interests or obligations provided
by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that either Party may assign this Agreement and any
or all rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates
upon prior written notice to the other Party; _provided_ , _further_ , that
no such assignment shall release either Party from any Liability under this

13.06_ shall be void _ab initio_.

 



82

    

Section 13.07. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements are for the sole benefit of the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, and, except with respect to
Buyer Indemnified Parties and Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Article
XII_ and the DandO Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.03_, or as
expressly set forth in the applicable Transaction Agreement, nothing in the
Transaction Agreements shall create or be deemed to create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any Person not a party to the Transaction Agreements,
including any Affiliates of any Party.

Section 13.08. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedules), the other Transaction Agreements (and all exhibits and schedules
hereto and thereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement collectively constitute
and contain the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
negotiations, correspondence, understandings, contracts and agreements,
whether written or oral, among the Parties respecting the subject matter
hereof and thereof. In the event that the provisions of the Transitional
Trademark License Agreement, Intellectual Property Cross License Agreement or
the Transition Services Agreement conflict with the provisions of this
Agreement, the provisions of such other Transaction Agreement shall govern
with respect to the subject matter addressed thereby to the extent of such
conflict.

 

Section 13.09. _Amendments_. The Transaction Agreements (including all
exhibits and schedules thereto) may be amended, restated supplemented or
otherwise modified, only by written agreement making specific reference to the
applicable Transaction Agreement to be amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified, in each case duly executed by each party to such
Transaction Agreement. No Consent from any Indemnified Party under _Article
XIII_ (in each case other than the Parties) shall be required to amend this
Agreement.

 

Section 13.10. _Waiver_. At any time before the Closing, either Seller or
Buyer may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other
acts of the other Person, (b) waive any breaches or inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other Person contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive
compliance with any covenant, agreement or condition contained in this
Agreement but such waiver of compliance with any such covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure. Any such waiver shall be in a written
instrument duly executed by the waiving Party. No failure on the part of
either Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or
remedy under any Transaction Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such

other right, power or remedy.

 

Section 13.11. _Governing Law_. The Transaction Agreements, and any Action
that may be based upon, arise out of or relate or be incidental to any
Transaction, any Transaction Agreement, the negotiation, execution,
performance or consummation of any of the foregoing or the inducement of any
Party to enter into any of the foregoing, whether for breach of contract,
tortious conduct or otherwise, and whether now existing or hereafter arising
(each, a

 



83

    

 "Transaction Dispute"), will be exclusively governed by and construed and
enforced in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any Law or rule that would cause the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware to be applied. The Parties
expressly acknowledge and agree that (a) the requirements of 6 Del. C § 2708
are satisfied by the provisions of this Agreement and that such statute
mandates the application of Laws of the State of Delaware to this Agreement,
the relationship of the Parties, the Transactions and the interpretation and
enforcement of the rights and duties of the Parties hereunder and (b) the
Parties have a reasonable basis for the application of the Laws of the State
of Delaware to this Agreement, the relationship of the Parties, the
Transactions and the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties
of the Parties hereunder. Seller shall cause the Seller Indemnified Parties,
and Buyer shall cause the Buyer Indemnified Parties, to comply with the
foregoing as though such Indemnified Parties were a Party to this Agreement.

 

Section 13.12. _Dispute Resolution; Consent to Jurisdiction_ _._

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.05_, any Transaction
Dispute will exclusively be brought and resolved in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (or, only if such court declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, then in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware or, if jurisdiction is not then available in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware (but only in such event),
then in any Delaware state court sitting in New Castle County) and any
appellate court from any of such courts. In that context, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each Party irrevocably and unconditionally:

(i) submits for itself and its property to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts with respect to any Transaction Dispute and for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, and agrees that all Claims in
respect of any Transaction Dispute shall be heard and determined in
such courts;

(ii) agrees that venue would be proper in such courts, and waives any
objection that it may now or hereafter have that any such court is an
improper or inconvenient forum for the resolution of any Transaction Dispute;
and

(iii) agrees that the mailing by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, to the Persons listed in _Section_ __ _ 13.03_ of any process
required by any such court, will be effective service of process; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein will be deemed to prevent a Party from making
service of process by any means authorized by the Laws of the State of
Delaware.

(b) The foregoing consent to jurisdiction will not constitute submission to
jurisdiction or general consent to service of process in the State of Delaware
for any purpose except with respect to any Transaction Dispute.

 

Section 13.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the maximum extent permitted by Law,
each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right to trial by jury
in any forum in respect of any Transaction Dispute and covenants that neither
it nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives will assert (whether as
plaintiff, defendant or otherwise) any right to such trial 

 



84

    

 by jury. Each Party certifies and acknowledges that (a) such Party has
considered the implications of this waiver, (b) such Party makes this waiver
voluntarily and (c) such waiver constitutes a material inducement upon which
such Party is relying and will rely in entering into the Transaction
Agreements. Each Party may file an original counterpart or a copy of this
_Section_ __ _ 13.13_ with any court as written evidence of the consent of
each Party to the waiver of its right to trial by jury.

Section 13.14. _Admissibility into Evidence_. All offers of compromise or
settlement among the Parties or their Representatives in connection with the
attempted resolution of any Transaction Dispute (a) shall be deemed to have
been delivered in furtherance of a Transaction Dispute settlement, (b) shall
be exempt from discovery and production and (c) shall not be admissible into
evidence (whether as an admission or otherwise) in any proceeding for the
resolution of the Transaction Dispute.

 

Section 13.15. _Remedies; Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Except to the extent set forth otherwise in this Agreement (including in
_Section_ __ _ 12.05_), all remedies under this Agreement expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the
exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

(b) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that irreparable damage (for which
monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy) would
occur and the Parties would not have an adequate remedy at law if any
provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific
terms or is otherwise breached, including if any Party fails to take
such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Transactions
or to enable the Transactions to be consummated. Accordingly, each Party
agrees that, unless this Agreement is validly terminated, the other Party will
be entitled to injunctive relief at any time from time to time in respect of
breaches (or threatened breaches) of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case
(i) without the requirement of posting any bond or other indemnity and (ii)
in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in
equity. Furthermore, each Party agrees (x) not to raise any objections
(whether on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach or otherwise) to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement, and to specifically enforce the terms of
this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party under this
Agreement and (y) that the right to specific performance is an integral part
of the Transactions and without such right neither Seller nor Buyer would
have entered into this Agreement. Each Party expressly disclaims that it is
owed any duty not expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 

(c) The Parties further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this _Section_ __ _ 13.15_, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right
to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a Party under this
Agreement in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event
that the remedies provided for in this  _Section_ __ _ 13.15_ are not

 



85

    

 available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 13.15_ shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for
(or limit any Partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific
performance under this _Section_ __ _ 13.15_ prior to or as a condition to
exercising any termination right under _Article XI_ (and pursuing damages
after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 13.15_ or anything set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 13.15_ restrict or limit any Partys right to pursue
any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter. In the event that a party initiates a proceeding seeking equitable
relief pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 13.15_, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended until such proceeding is finally resolved.

Section 13.16. _Non-Recourse_. All Claims, obligations, Liabilities or causes
of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to the Transaction Agreements,
or the negotiation, execution, or performance of the Transaction Agreements
(including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as
an inducement to, the Transaction Agreements), may be made only against (and
are expressly limited to) the entities that are expressly identified as
parties in the preamble to this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements,
as applicable ("Contracting Parties"). No Person who is not a Contracting
Party, including any past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, or representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any
Contracting Party, or any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or representative
of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing ("Nonparty
Affiliates"), shall have any Liability (whether in contract or in tort, in
law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action,
obligations or Liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or
related in any manner to the Transaction Agreements or based on, in respect
of, or by reason of the Transaction Agreements or their negotiation,
execution, performance or breach; and, to the maximum extent permitted by law,
each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such Liabilities,
claims, causes of action and obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates.

Section 13.17. _Interest_. If any payment expressly required to be made to a
Party under this Agreement is made after the date on which such payment is
due, interest shall accrue on such amount from (but not including) the due
date of the payment to (and including) the date such payment is actually made
at the Interest Rate. All computations of interest pursuant to this Agreement
shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days, in each case, for the actual
number of days from (but not including) the first day to (and including) the
last day occurring in the period for which such interest is payable.

Section 13.18. _Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits_. The Disclosure Schedules,
Schedules and Exhibits attached to this Agreement shall be construed with and
as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if the same had
been set forth verbatim herein. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit or
Schedule or in the Disclosure Schedules but not otherwise defined therein
shall be defined as set forth in this Agreement. The representations and
warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement are made and given subject
to the disclosures contained in the Disclosure Schedules, and neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates shall be, or deemed to be, in breach of any such
representations and warranties (and no claim shall lie in 

 



86

    

 respect thereof) in respect of any such matter so disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedules. Where only brief particulars of a matter are set out or
referred to in the Disclosure Schedules or a reference is made only to a
particular part of a disclosed document, full particulars of the matter and
the full contents of the document are deemed to be disclosed to the extent
such full particulars or full contents can be reasonably understood from the
disclosures set forth in the Disclosure Schedules together with such documents
as have been made available to Buyer. Inclusion of information in the
Disclosure Schedules will not be construed as an admission that such
information is material to the business, operations or condition (financial
or otherwise) of the Business. The Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for
purposes of convenience in separately titled Schedules corresponding to the
Sections of this Agreement, however, each Schedule (other than _Schedule
4.08(b)_ ) of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to incorporate by
reference all information disclosed in any other Schedule of the Disclosure
Schedules to the extent it is reasonably apparent that the disclosure of such
matter is applicable to such Schedule of the Disclosure Schedules.

Section 13.19. _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. Each Party to
this Agreement agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and
Representatives, that Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP may serve
as counsel to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
Transferred Entity, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements and the
consummation of the Transactions, and that, following consummation of the
Transactions, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP may serve as
counsel to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any Representative of any such
party, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of

such prior representation of any Transferred Entity and each Party consents
thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each Party
shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to consent to waive any
conflict of interest arising from such representation.

 

Section 13.20. _Privilege_. Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates, and its and
its Affiliates respective successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally acknowledges and agrees that, other than in the case of Fraud,
all attorney-client privileged communications between any Seller, any of its
Subsidiaries (including any Transferred Entity), any JV and their respective
current or former Affiliates or Representatives and their counsel, including
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, made before the consummation of
the Closing in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and Closing under any Transaction Agreement or any Transaction
Dispute shall continue after the Closing to be privileged communications with
such counsel and neither Buyer nor any of its former or current Affiliates
or Representatives nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through
Buyer or any of its current or former Affiliates or Representatives, shall
seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the privilege
attaching to such communications belongs to Buyer, any Transferred Entity or
the Business or on any other grounds.

Section 13.21. _Counterparts_. Each Transaction Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimiles,
e-mail transmission of .pdf signatures or other electronic copies of
signatures shall be deemed to be originals.

 



87

    

Section 13.22. _Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, each Party: (a) agrees that it will not
bring any action, suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the debt
financing sources (or any Lender Related Party) in any way relating to this

relating in any way to the Financing, in any forum other than the federal and
New York State courts located in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New
York; (b) agrees that all claims or causes of action (whether in law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the debt financing
sources (or any Lender Related Party) in any way relating to the Financing,
shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws
of the State of New York; and (c) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
litigation (whether in law or in equity; whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise) directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained this Agreement,
(i) the Seller, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders shall not have any rights
or Claims against any debt financing source (or any Lender Related Party) in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise and (ii) no debt financing source (and no Lender Related
Party) shall have any Liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise)
to the Seller, its Subsidiaries, their respective Representatives and their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or Liabilities of any
Party hereto under this Agreement or for any Claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the Transactions or in respect of any oral representations made
or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing, whether at
law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the debt financing sources (and the
Lender Related Parties) are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and shall
be entitled to the protections of this provision (it being understood that the
foregoing provisions may not be amended in a manner adverse to the debt
financing sources (or the Lender Related Parties) in any material respect
without their prior written consent).

MANAGEMENT OF ASSETS FOR THE ACQUIRORS ACCOUNT

 

Until such time as any Deferred Business has been transferred by a Seller
Party to Buyer (each, a "Deferred Transfer"), the assets, Liabilities, rights
and obligations to which such Deferred Business relates shall be held for
Buyers benefit, and shall be managed and operated by Buyer, if legally
permissible, or a Seller Party if otherwise, in each case for Buyers account
in the manner hereinafter provided from the Closing to the time of the
Deferred Transfer, with all gains, income, losses, Taxes or other items
generated thereby to be for Buyers account, in each case, without
duplicating Buyers obligations pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.03_.

Without duplicating Buyers obligations pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 12.03_,
Buyer shall reimburse (in the case of Taxes, two Business Days before the due
date for the payment of such Taxes) Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than
Subsidiaries to be transferred as part of the Deferred Business) (the "Non-
Deferred Subsidiaries") and shall hold Seller and its Non-Deferred Affiliates
harmless from and against all of Sellers and its Non-Deferred Subsidiaries
Losses arising out of, resulting from or incurred in connection with Sellers
or any of its Non-Deferred Subsidiaries post-Closing direct or indirect
ownership, management, operation or sale (other than to Buyer) of the Deferred
Business, including the amount of any Taxes imposed upon or incurred by Seller
or such Non-Deferred Subsidiaries as a result thereof in excess of the amount
of Taxes that would have been imposed upon or incurred by Seller or such Non-
Deferred Subsidiaries if the Deferred Business had been transferred to Buyer
on the Closing Date. The principles of _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)_ (with time
periods adjusted as is reasonable and practicable under the circumstances) to
the extent applicable shall govern the preparation and filing of any Tax
Returns by Seller or its Subsidiaries that include a Deferred Business for
periods following the Closing Date and ending on or prior to the date of the
applicable Deferred Transfer, except that for this purposes any reference to
Seller in such Section shall be treated as a reference to Buyer and any
reference in such Section to Buyer shall be treated as a reference to Seller.

 

In the event a Deferred Business is being managed or operated by Seller, from
the Closing to the date of the Deferred Transfer, unless otherwise reasonably
instructed in writing by Buyer, Seller shall hold, operate and manage the
Deferred Business only in the ordinary course of business and pursuant to the
instructions of Buyer, subject to applicable Law, and shall continue
to comply with all covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that
are required by their terms to be performed prior to the Closing. Subject to
applicable Law (including all Laws and regulations requiring investment
approvals or consents or antimonopoly clearances, exemptions or waivers in
connection with any disposition of the Deferred Business, and all exchange
controls and Laws concerning foreign corrupt practices, expatriation of funds
or otherwise), Seller shall, in respect of any Deferred Business, use
reasonable best efforts to follow and implement the written instructions and
policies of Buyer relating to the holding, managing and operating of the
Deferred Business.
