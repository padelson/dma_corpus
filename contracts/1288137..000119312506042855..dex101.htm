ARTICLE II 



_PURCHASE AND SALE OF ASSETS_



2.1 _Transfer of Purchased Assets_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein, at the Closing and effective as of the Effective
Time, Seller shall sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver, or cause to be
sold, conveyed, transferred, assigned and delivered, to Buyer, all of
Sellers and Sellers Affiliates rights, title and interest in and to each of
the Purchased Assets as of the Effective Time, free and clear of all
Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances, and Buyer shall purchase the
Purchased Assets and assume the Assumed Liabilities.



(b) To the extent any Purchased Asset is owned by any Affiliate of Seller, at
the Closing, Seller shall cause such Affiliate to join in the conveyance,
transfer, assignment and delivery of such Purchased Asset to Buyer in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.



2.2 _Excluded Assets_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Seller
is not selling, conveying, transferring, assigning or delivering to Buyer any
assets, properties or rights of Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates that is
not a Purchased Asset (an " _Excluded Asset_ "), including the following
assets, properties and rights of Seller and its Affiliates:



(a) cash, including bank balances and bank accounts, cash equivalents and
similar type items on hand in the Business at the Effective Time; and



(b) all Sellers Accounts Receivable.



2.3 _Assumption of Liabilities_. (a) At the Closing and effective as of the
Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained
herein, Buyer shall assume all of the following Liabilities of Seller or
Sellers Affiliates to the extent related to the Purchased Assets or the
Business (" _Assumed Liabilities_ "):



(i) all Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates arising under the
Assumed Contracts, to the extent relating to performance of the Assumed
Contracts from and after the Effective Time;



(ii) all Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates in respect of Taxes for
which Buyer is liable pursuant to _Section 2.12_;



(iii) all Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates in respect of
Trade Programs for which Buyer is liable pursuant to _Section 2.9_;



 

12 (iv) all Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates in respect of product
returns, charge-backs, over, short and damage claims, fines and fees, product
recalls and proration items for which Buyer is liable pursuant to _Sections
2.8_ , _2.10_ and _2.11_ ; and



(v) all Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates that are expressly allocated
to Buyer in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.



(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, (i)
Buyer is assuming only the Assumed Liabilities and is not assuming any
Excluded Liability, (ii) Buyers assumption of any Assumed Contract that is in
the nature of a Collective Bargaining Agreement or employment agreement shall
be subject to the limitations contained in _Section 9.2_, and (iii) with
respect to the ConAgra Trademark License Agreement, Buyer shall assume all
duties and obligations of Henkel KGaA thereunder, including all duties and
obligations of Henkel KGaA thereunder relating to periods prior to the
Effective Time, provided that, as between Buyer and Henkel KGaA, Buyer shall
be responsible for all Liabilities arising thereunder only to the extent
such Liabilities relate to the periods from and after the Effective Time and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall be responsible
for royalties payable thereunder only to the extent such royalties relate to
periods from and after the Effective Time and, with respect to payment of any
royalties payable thereunder after the Closing and that are the responsibility
of Seller in accordance with the terms of this sentence, Seller shall cause
the amount of such royalties to be paid to Buyer no later than ten (10)
calendar days prior to the date on which such amount is due and payable to the
licensor under the ConAgra Trademark License Agreement, and Buyer shall tender
Sellers portion of such royalties to the licensor on or prior to the date
such amount is due and payable to the licensor and notify Seller when such
payment has been made to the licensor. From and after the Effective Time,
Seller shall remain liable for all Excluded Liabilities. 



2.4 _Purchase Price_. (a) At the Closing, in consideration of the sale,
transfer, assignment, conveyance and delivery of the Purchased Assets, Buyer
shall (i) pay or cause to be paid to Seller an aggregate amount equal to One
Hundred Eighty Three Million Dollars ($183,000,000) (the " _Base Purchase
Price_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Seller, and (ii) assume the Assumed Liabilities.



(b) Within sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a tax allocation of the Purchase Price (and the Assumed
Liabilities, if any, that constitute debt for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) among the Purchased Assets that complies with Section 1060 of the
Code. If Buyer does not deliver to Seller a written objection to such
allocation within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery thereof to Buyer,
then such allocation shall govern. If Buyer delivers a written objection to
Seller to such allocation within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of
the allocation to Buyer, then Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith
in an attempt to reach agreement upon such allocation. If the allocation is
not agreed upon during the thirty (30) calendar day period after Buyers
written objection is delivered to Seller or within a mutually agreed-to
extended time period, Buyer and Seller agree that the allocation shall be
based upon an asset valuation supplied by an independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing to be mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller.
Seller and Buyer shall act in accordance with such allocation in the filing of
all income tax returns (including filing Form 8594 with their Federal income
tax return for the taxable year that includes the date 



 

13 of the Closing) and in the course of any tax audit, tax review or tax
litigation relating thereto, except as otherwise required by a determination,
as defined in Section 1313 of the Code. The cost of such appraisal shall be
shared equally by Buyer and Seller.



2.5 _Inventory Adjustment_.



(a) Within ninety (90) calendar days after the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a "Statement of Change in Inventory Value" from December 31,
2005 to the Effective Time in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit H_. In
addition, at such time Seller shall deliver to Buyer a procedures report from
KPMG, L.L.P. setting forth its findings with regard to the performance of the
agreed upon procedures as set forth in _Exhibit I_ attached hereto in respect
of Sellers calculation and value, as of the Effective Time, of all Inventory
included in the Purchased Assets prepared as described herein (the "
_Statement of Inventory Value_ "). Buyer and an accounting firm selected by
Buyer, at Buyers expense, shall have the right to be present to observe the
taking of any physical inventory in conjunction with the preparation
of Sellers calculation of the Statement of Inventory Value and may review
and examine the procedures, books, records and work papers used in its
preparation. The Statement of Inventory Value shall reflect the value (net of
any reserve relating thereto) of all Inventory included in the Purchased
Assets in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied since December 31, 2005,
as of the Effective Time and that conforms with the representations and
warranties set forth in  _Section 4.18_, with such determination reflecting
(i) an accounting adjustment derived from a physical count of such Inventory
and a qualitative inspection of such Inventory, each conducted by Seller, and
(ii) the accounting adjustments derived from the Books and Records that
reflect changes in such Inventory during the period from the Effective Time to
the date of such physical count and qualitative inspection. In determining the
value of such Inventory, all reserves relating thereto (other than a
valuation reserve relating to accurately stating such valuation on a first in,
first out basis) as reflected in the Financial Statements shall not be reduced
or otherwise decreased.



(b) Unless Buyer, within forty-five (45) calendar days after receipt of the
Statement of Inventory Value, delivers a written notice to Seller that it
objects to the computation contained therein, specifying the basis for such
objection and setting forth Buyers calculation of the value of such Inventory
as of the Effective Time (an " _Objection Notice_ "), Sellers calculation of
such Inventory shall be binding upon the parties. The computation of the
Statement of Inventory Value shall not be disputed as to accounting principles
so long as the principles and procedures used to compute it are in accordance
with GAAP and _Section 2.5(a)_. The delivery to Buyer of the audited
financial statements pursuant to _Section 6.3(c)_ and the use thereof in any
filing made by Buyer pursuant to applicable securities laws shall in no way
prejudice Buyers right to assert an objection to Sellers calculation
pursuant to an Objection Notice. If Buyer timely delivers an Objection Notice
to Seller, then Buyer and Seller shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the
objections presented in the Objection Notice, for a period of thirty (30)
calendar days from the date of delivery of the Objection Notice. If Buyer and
Seller are unable to agree upon the calculation of a Statement of Inventory
Value within such thirty (30) calendar day period or within a mutually agreed-
to extended time period, the dispute shall be referred to Ernst and Young for a
final determination thereof, or such other recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Buyer and Seller are unable to so agree
within five (5) calendar days after Ernst and Young informs either Buyer or
Seller of its unwillingness to so serve (the " _Decline_



 

14 _Date_ "), then within ten (10) calendar days after the Decline Date, each of
Buyer and Seller shall select an office of an independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing and such two firms shall, within fifteen (15)
calendar days after the Decline Date, then select a third independent
accounting firm of recognized national standing to resolve the dispute (such
selected accountants, the " _Settlement Accountants_ "). Buyer and Seller will
enter into reasonable and customary arrangements for the services to be
rendered by the Settlement Accountants under this  _Section 2.5_. The
determination of the dispute by the Settlement Accountants shall be final,
binding and conclusive and shall not be subject to further review, challenge
or adjustment. Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Settlement Accountants to reach a determination as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within thirty (30) calendar days from the date
that the dispute is submitted to it), and the Settlement Accountants shall
limit their review only to the dispute submitted to it. The Settlement
Accountants shall only assign a value to such Inventory as of the Effective
Time that is within the range for the value of such Inventory defined by the
value of such Inventory set forth in the Statement of Inventory Value
delivered by Seller and the value of such Inventory set forth in the Objection
Notice. Buyer and Seller shall each furnish the Settlement Accountants such
workpapers and other documents and information relating to the dispute, and
shall provide interviews and answer questions, as the Settlement Accountants
may reasonably request. Each party shall pay its own costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this _Section 2.5_;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall each pay one
half of the fees and expenses of the Settlement Accountants.



(c) The Base Purchase Price shall be either increased by the amount by which
the final "Inventory Valuation as of Effective Time" as set forth in the
"Statement of Change in Inventory Value" exceeds Thirty Four Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($34,500,000) or decreased by the amount by which the
value of such Inventory is less than Thirty Four Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($34,500,000).



(d) Any Base Purchase Price adjustment payment as finally determined or
agreed upon under _Sections 2.5(b)_ and _2.5(c)_ shall be payable promptly
upon request in accordance with the instructions of the appropriate recipient,
together with interest thereon for each day from and including the Closing
Date to the date of such payment, at a rate per annum equal to the Interest
Rate on the Closing Date.



2.6 _Adjustment Based on Adjusted Product Contribution Amount_.



(a) Unless Buyer, within twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of
the Statement of Adjusted Product Contribution Amount, delivers a written
notice to Seller that it objects to the computation of the Adjusted Product
Contribution Amount contained therein, specifying the basis for such objection
(a " _PC Objection Notice_ "), the calculation of the Adjusted Product
Contribution Amount, as delivered to Buyer pursuant to _Section 6.3(d)_,
shall be final and binding upon the parties. A PC Objection Notice may not be
based upon an objection to the calculation of the Base Product Contribution
Amount but rather may only be based upon the reconciliation and calculation of
the Adjusted Product Contribution Amount. If Buyer timely delivers a PC
Objection Notice to Seller, then Buyer and Seller shall endeavor in good
faith to resolve the objections presented in the PC Objection Notice, for a
period of ten (10) calendar days from the date of delivery of the PC Objection
Notice. If Buyer and Seller are unable to



 

15 agree upon the calculation of the Adjusted Product Contribution Amount within
such ten (10) calendar day period or within a mutually agreed-to extended
time period, the dispute shall be referred to Ernst and Young for a final
determination thereof, or such other recognized firm of independent certified
public accountants selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Buyer and Seller are unable to so agree
within five (5) calendar days after Ernst and Young informs either Buyer or
Seller of its unwillingness to so serve (the " _PC Decline Date_ "), then
within ten (10) calendar days after the PC Decline Date, each of Buyer and
Seller shall select an office of an independent accounting firm of recognized
national standing and such two firms shall, within fifteen (15) calendar days
after the PC Decline Date, then select a third independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing to resolve the dispute (such selected
accountants, the " _PC Settlement Accountants_ "). Buyer and Seller will
enter into reasonable and customary arrangements for the services to be
rendered by the PC Settlement Accountants under this _Section 2.6(a)_. The
determination of the dispute and the resulting Adjusted Product Contribution
Amount by the PC Settlement Accountants shall be final, binding and
conclusive and shall not be subject to further review, challenge or
adjustment. Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the PC Settlement Accountants to reach a determination as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within thirty (30) calendar days from the date
that the dispute is submitted to it), and the PC Settlement Accountants shall
limit their review only to the dispute submitted to it. Buyer and Seller
shall each furnish the PC Settlement Accountants such workpapers and other
documents and information relating to the dispute, and shall provide
interviews and answer questions, as the PC Settlement Accountants may
reasonably request. Each party shall pay its own costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this _Section 2.6(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall each pay one half
of the fees and expenses of the PC Settlement Accountants.



(b) If the Adjusted Product Contribution Amount as finally determined
hereunder is less than the Target Product Contribution Amount by an amount
greater than the Adjustment Threshold, then the Base Purchase Price shall be
decreased on a post-Closing basis by an amount equal to the product of (i)
the Product Contribution Shortfall Amount multiplied by (ii) the Purchase
Price Multiple (the Base Purchase Price, as increased or decreased pursuant to
_Section 2.5(c)_, and as decreased pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ (if any
such decrease is required), is referred to herein as the " _Final Purchase
Price_ "). Any Base Purchase Price adjustment payment required under this
_Section 2.6_ shall be payable promptly upon request in accordance with
Buyers instructions, together with interest thereon for each day from and
including the Closing Date to the date of such payment, at a rate per annum
equal to the Interest Rate on the Closing Date.



2.7 _Accounts Receivable_. Seller shall be entitled to the collection and
receipt of all Accounts Receivable in respect of goods and products Shipped or
services rendered prior to the Effective Time (" _Seller s Accounts
Receivable_"). Buyer shall be entitled to the collection and receipt of all
Accounts Receivable in respect of goods and products Shipped or services
rendered on or after the Effective Time (" _Buyer s Accounts Receivable_").
Except as contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall be
entitled, after the Closing, to direct all trade debtors to make payment on
all of Buyers Accounts Receivable at a specified address and/or account, and
to the extent that either Buyer or Seller receives payment of Accounts
Receivable owned by the other party, Buyer and Seller agree to promptly
(within ten (10) calendar days) remit the proceeds to the designated bank
account of Seller or Buyer, as appropriate, and Seller



 

16 and Buyer shall otherwise cooperate in good faith in order to ensure that
Seller receives payment of Sellers Accounts Receivable and that Buyer
receives payment of Buyers Accounts Receivable. Any payments received from a
Person that reference a specific invoice delivered to such Person shall be
applied to such invoice. Any payments received from a Person that do not
reference a specific invoice delivered to such Person shall be applied to the
most current invoice delivered to such Person.



2.8 _Product Returns, Charge-backs, Etc_. Seller shall have responsibility for
Liabilities related to all returns, charge-backs, over, short and damage
claims, and fines and fees with respect to Purchased Products Shipped prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however, that for Purchased Products charged
back through reclamation (whether Shipped before or after the Effective Time),
Seller shall only be responsible for such Liabilities for a period of ninety
(90) days after the Effective Time). Buyer shall have responsibility for
Liabilities related to all returns, charge-backs, over, short and damage
claims, and fines and fees with respect to Purchased Products Shipped on or
after the Effective Time, including all Purchased Products charged back
through reclamation (whether Shipped before or after the Effective Time)
commencing after a period of ninety (90) days following the Effective Time,
except to the extent that any such Liabilities arise from a breach of this
Agreement by Seller and as to which a claim for indemnification may be
asserted under Section 10.2(a), in which case Seller shall be responsible for
such Liabilities. No party hereto shall undertake any action to encourage
returns with respect to Purchased Products other than in the Ordinary Course
of Business.



2.9 _Allocation of Trade Programs_. Seller shall have responsibility for
Liabilities associated with all Trade Programs to the extent such Trade
Programs relate to or are attributable to Sellers Accounts Receivable, and
Buyer shall have responsibility for Liabilities associated with all Trade
Programs to the extent such Trade Programs relate to or are attributable to
Buyers Accounts Receivable. Notwithstanding the foregoing:



(a) in the case of Trade Programs that are based on a specified target volume
of sales being reached or specified performance contracts, pre-paid or pre-
funded accounts, where the Liabilities associated with such Trade Programs
affect the collectibility or value of Accounts Receivable in respect of sales
after such specified target volume of sales or performance targets have been
reached but not the collectibility or value of the Accounts Receivable
in respect of the sales that count toward the specified target goals, and the
specified target goals for such Trade Programs are reached, then the
Liabilities associated with such Trade Programs shall be re-allocated so that
all of such Liabilities shall be allocated to the Accounts Receivable in
respect of the sales that counted toward the specified target goals, and,
within such Accounts Receivable, to Sellers Accounts Receivable and Buyers
Accounts Receivable based on the proportion of such sales that counted toward
the specified target goals that generated Sellers Accounts Receivable and
Buyers Accounts Receivable, respectively; and



(b) Seller shall be responsible for all Liabilities related to free-standing
insert coupons dropped or inserted prior to the Effective Time, and Buyer
shall be responsible for all Liabilities related to free-standing insert
coupons dropped or inserted on or after the Effective Time.



 

17 2.10 _Recalls_. In the event that (a) any Governmental Entity issues a
request, directive or order that any Purchased Product be recalled, (b) a
court of competent jurisdiction orders such a recall, or (c) Buyer reasonably
determines that any Purchased Product should be recalled for any reason, Buyer
and Seller shall take all appropriate corrective actions reasonably requested
by the other party hereto or by any Governmental Entity. In the event that
such recall relates to any Purchased Products manufactured prior to the
Effective Time, Seller shall be responsible for all Liabilities of the
recall. In the event that such recall relates to any Purchased Products
manufactured on or after the Effective Time, Buyer shall be responsible for
all Liabilities of the recall.



2.11 _Prorations_. On the Closing Date, or as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than sixty (60)
calendar days thereafter, the real and personal property taxes, water, gas,
electricity and other utilities, common area maintenance reimbursements to
lessors, local business or other license fees or taxes, merchants
association dues and other similar periodic charges payable with respect to
the Purchased Assets or the Business shall be prorated between Buyer and
Seller effective as of the Effective Time. To the extent practicable, utility
meter readings for the Ft. Madison Facility shall be determined as of the
Effective Time. If the final real property tax rate or final assessed value
for the current tax year is not established by the Closing Date,
the prorations shall be made on the basis of the rate or assessed value in
effect for the preceding tax year and shall be adjusted when the exact amounts
are determined. All such prorations shall be based upon the most recent
available assessed value of the Ft. Madison Facility prior to the Closing
Date.



2.12  _Closing Costs; Transfer Taxes and Fees_.



(a) Buyer shall pay the cost of all sale and use Taxes arising out of the
transfer of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall pay
all costs and expenses (including recording fees and real estate transfer
Taxes and real estate transfer stamps) incurred in connection with
transferring or recording title to the Purchased Assets. The sales, use and
transfer tax returns required by reason of said transfer shall be timely
prepared and filed by the party normally obligated by law or regulation to
make such filing. The parties agree to cooperate with each other in connection
with the preparation and filing of such returns, in obtaining all available
exemptions from such sales, use and transfer Taxes, and in timely providing
each other with resale certificates and any other documents necessary to
satisfy any such exemptions.



(b) If Buyer or Seller pays any Tax agreed to be borne by the other party
under this Agreement, such other party shall promptly (within 10 business
days) reimburse the paying party for the amounts so paid. If any party
receives any refund or credit of Tax to which another party is entitled under
this Agreement, the receiving party shall promptly (within 10 business days)
pay such amounts to the party entitled thereto.



2.13 _Failure to Obtain Consent_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Assumption Agreement or the Bill of Sale, to
the extent that the transfer to Buyer of any Assumed Contract or Permit that
is a Purchased Asset requires any governmental or third-party authorizations,
approvals, consents or waivers, and the Closing occurs without such
authorization, approval, consent or waiver having been obtained, then neither
this



 

18 Agreement, the Assumption Agreement nor the Bill of Sale shall constitute a
transfer of such Assumed Contract or Permit, or an attempt thereof. In the
event that the Closing occurs without the transfer of such Assumed Contract,
then, following the Closing, the parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Seller nor Buyer shall be required to pay any consideration for any
such authorization, approval, consent or waiver. Pending such
authorization, approval, consent or waiver, the parties shall cooperate with
each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful arrangements (to
the extent any such arrangements are feasible) designed to provide to Buyer
the benefits of such Assumed Contract or Permit, that Buyer would have
obtained had such Assumed Contract or Permit been transferred to Buyer at the
Closing. To the extent that Buyer is provided the benefits pursuant to this
_Section 2.13_ of any such Assumed Contract, Buyer shall perform, for the
benefit of Seller, the obligations of Seller thereunder and any related
Liabilities that, but for the lack of an authorization, approval, consent or
waiver in connection with the assignment of such Assumed Contract to Buyer,
would have become Liabilities of Buyer by virtue of _Section 2.3(a)_. Once
authorization, approval, consent or waiver for the transfer of any such
Assumed Contract or Permit not transferred at the Closing is obtained, Seller
shall transfer any such Assumed Contract or Permit to Buyer and Buyer shall
assume obligations under such Assumed Contracts in accordance with _Section
2.3(a)_. To the extent that any such Assumed Contract or Permit cannot
be transferred following the Closing pursuant to this _Section 2.13_, then
Buyer and Seller shall cooperate reasonably in an effort to find and enter
into mutually agreeable arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing or
subcontracting), if feasible, to provide the parties the economic (taking
into account Tax costs and benefits) and operational equivalent, to the extent
permitted, of obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or waiver and
the performance by Buyer of the obligations thereunder. Seller shall hold in
trust for, and pay to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof, all income,
proceeds and other monies received by Seller in respect of Buyers performance
of any such Assumed Contract in connection with the arrangements under this
_Section 2.13_. This _Section 2.13_ shall in all cases be limited to the
extent necessary not to result in a violation of applicable law.

and assets. Seller is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is
necessary under applicable law as a result of the conduct of its business or
the ownership of its properties, except where the failure to be so qualified

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.



4.2 _Authorization_. Seller has all requisite corporate power and authority,
and has taken all corporate action necessary, to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder. Each of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which Seller is a party has been (or, when executed
and delivered, will have been) duly executed and delivered by Seller and
constitutes (or, when executed and delivered, will constitute) a legal, valid
and binding obligation of Seller enforceable against Seller in accordance with
its terms except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors rights generally or
by equitable principles (whether considered in an action at law or in equity).



4.3 _Consents and Approvals_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.3_ hereto,
(i) no notice to, declaration, filing or registration with, or authorization,
consent or approval of, or permit from, any Governmental Entity (other than in

Person, and (ii) no consent to the assignment of any Material Contract that

be obtained prior to the Closing, and subject to the obligations provided in
_Sections 2.13_ and _6.5_ , the failure to obtain such consents shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements.

set forth in _Section 7.3_ and _8.3_ hereof. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party shall promptly supply any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act and cooperate fully in connection with any filing under applicable
antitrust laws and in connection with resolving any related investigation or
other inquiry concerning the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
Either party hereto shall promptly inform the other of any material
communication and requests for information from any governmental authority
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall make, or cause
to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the
other party, appropriate response to any such communication. In addition, if
necessary to obtain HSR Act approval, Buyer shall take any and all actions
with respect to the Purchased Assets, its assets or the assets of any of its
Affiliates (including selling, holding separate, licensing or otherwise
disposing of such assets, or agreeing to, or permitting, any of the foregoing
with respect to such assets). The obligations of Seller under this _Section
6.5_ with respect to the non-United States Intellectual Property shall be
subject to _Section 9.3_. In addition, Buyer and Seller agree that to the
extent a Permit is a Purchased Asset that requires a governmental consent for
the assignment of the Permit to Buyer, and such consent is not obtained prior
to the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall use their respective best reasonable
efforts to obtain the required governmental consent as promptly as practicable
after the Closing.

customer over the prior one year period;

the event that the financings contemplated by the Financing Facilities are not
available to Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer shall (a) promptly notify Seller of such fact and (b) use
its reasonable best efforts, until the Termination Date, to obtain alternate
financing for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that
the terms, conditions and costs of such financing are not materially less
favorable to Buyer than those in the Financing Facilities.



 

40 6.8 _Financial Information; Cooperation_.



(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer copies of all financial statements, financial
schedules and other financial information, including management reports,
relating to the Business promptly after the preparation or receipt, as

generality of the foregoing, (a) not later than ten (10) calendar days after
the end of each month, Seller shall deliver to Buyer (for further delivery to
Buyers lenders under the Debt Facility) a schedule of product contribution
for the most recently completed monthly period prepared in a manner consistent
with the historical accounting practices of Seller, and (b) Seller shall
provide Buyer with copies of all information relating to the Business
delivered by Seller to its lenders at such time as Seller provides the same to
any of its lenders.



(b) Buyer may include the financial statements contemplated by _Section
6.3(c)_ in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, representatives and advisors to, (i) use
reasonable best efforts to cause KPMG L.L.P. to provide consents and other
documentation indicating KPMG L.L.P.s agreement to the inclusion of its

officers, directors, representatives and advisors, including legal and
accounting, to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer in connection with obtaining
the debt financing contemplated by the Financing Facilities at Buyers
expense.



6.9 _Acquisition Proposals_. From the date of this Agreement until termination
of this Agreement or the Closing, Seller shall not directly or indirectly,
through any Affiliate, officer, director, stockholder, partner, employee,
agent, financial advisor, banker or other representative (collectively, the "
_Representatives_ "), or otherwise, solicit, initiate, or encourage
the submission of any proposal or offer from any person (other than Buyer)
relating to any acquisition or purchase of all or any material portion of the
Business or the Purchased Assets or participate in any negotiations regarding,
or furnish to any other person any information with respect to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate, or
encourage, any effort or attempt by any other person to do or seek to do any
of the foregoing. Seller shall immediately communicate to Buyer the material
terms of any such proposal or offer (and the identity of the party making such
proposal) which it or any of its Affiliates may receive and, if such proposal
is in writing, Seller shall promptly deliver a copy of such proposal to
Buyer. Seller shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any
parties other than Buyer conducted heretofore with respect to any of
the foregoing.

respond to all inquiries with respect to ownership of the Purchased Assets or
the Business by disclosing that Buyer is the owner of the Purchased Assets and
the Business or by referring such inquiries to Buyer, as appropriate.



 

41 6.11 _Insurance Claims_. With respect to any loss, liability or damage
incurred by Buyer and relating to, resulting from or arising out of the
conduct of the Business by Buyer for which Seller or any of its Affiliates
would be entitled to assert, or cause any Affiliate or other person or entity
to assert, a claim for recovery under any policy of insurance maintained by
Seller or any of its Affiliates in respect of the Business or the Purchased
Assets, at the request of Buyer, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to assert (or cause its applicable Affiliate to assert), or to assist
Buyer to assert, one or more claims under such insurance covering such loss,
liability or damage if Buyer is not itself entitled to assert such claim but
Seller or any of its Affiliates is so entitled. Any recovery received by
Seller or such Affiliate or other Person as a result of any such assertion to
which Buyer is entitled shall be promptly paid to Buyer. Buyer agrees to pay
or assume all costs or liabilities of Seller or any of its Affiliates in
connection with any such assertion of any such claim, including legal
expenses, deductibles, retentions or self-insurance paid or incurred by Seller
or any of its Affiliates. Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller in connection
with any assertion of claims under insurance as contemplated by this _Section
6.11_.

relating to bulk transfers and bulk sales applicable to the transactions

6.13 _Payments Received_. Seller and Buyer agree that, from and after the
Effective Time, each of Seller and Buyer will hold and will promptly transfer
and deliver to the other, from time to time as and when received by them, any
cash or checks with appropriate endorsements (using their commercially
reasonable efforts not to convert such checks into cash), or other property
that they may receive on or after the Closing that properly belongs to the
other party.



6.14 _Assignment of Noncompetition and Other Agreements_. At the Closing,
Seller shall assign to Buyer all rights of Seller pursuant to
any noncompetition, confidentiality, nonsolicitation or indemnification
provisions that benefit the Business or that relate to the Purchased Assets or
Assumed Liabilities contained in any Material Contracts with third parties,
including employees (and that are not Assumed Contracts).



6.15 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.



(a) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the third
anniversary thereof, except as permitted in this _Section 6.15_, Seller shall
not, and Seller shall cause its Affiliates not to, engage in any business that
competes with the Purchased Products or the Business, including the business
of manufacturing, distributing, marketing or selling Vienna sausage, canned
meat, potted meat, dried beef, chili, or luncheon meat products. The
restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.15_ shall not be construed to
prohibit or restrict: (i) any minority equity investment by Seller any of its
Affiliates in any Person in which Seller or its Affiliates do not have the
right to designate a member of the board of directors (or similar
governing body) of such entity, or in which Seller or its Affiliates
collectively hold not more than 5% of the outstanding voting securities; or
(ii) any business (other than the Business) currently conducted by Seller or
its Affiliates.



 

42 (b) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the third
anniversary thereof, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
without the prior written consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly, solicit to
hire or hire, or enter into a consulting agreement with, any person who was an
employee or consultant to the Business at any time from and after the

general solicitations in newspapers or similar mass media not targeted towards
Employees, former employees of the Business or consultants to the Business.



6.16 _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing:



(a) In respect of all confidential information that relates to the Business
(" _Confidential Information_ "), Seller shall use all reasonable best efforts
to, and shall cause each of Sellers Affiliates to use all reasonable best
efforts to, treat all Confidential Information as confidential, preserve the
confidentiality thereof and not disclose any Confidential Information, except
to its Representatives and respective Affiliates who need to know such
Confidential Information. If Confidential Information is disclosed
in violation of this _Section 6.16_, Seller shall immediately notify Buyer
in writing and, as applicable, take all reasonable steps required to prevent
further disclosure.



(b) In addition to all other remedies available to Buyer at law or in equity,
the parties agree that Buyer shall be entitled to equitable relief, including
injunctive relief and specific performance, in the event of any breach of this
_Section 6.16_.



(c) If Seller or any of its Affiliates is requested or required (by oral
questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in
legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar
process) by operation of law to disclose any Confidential Information, Seller
shall provide Buyer with prompt written notice of such request or requirement,
which notice shall, if practicable, be at least 48 hours prior to making such
disclosure, so that Buyer may seek a protective order or other appropriate
remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section 6.16_.
If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of
such a waiver, Seller or any of its Affiliates is nonetheless, in the opinion
of its counsel, legally required to disclose Confidential Information, then
such Person may disclose that portion of the Confidential Information which
such counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed, provided that Seller
uses its reasonable best efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the
Confidential Information, whereupon such disclosure shall not constitute a
breach of this _Section 6.16_.



6.17  _Abstract of Title; Survey_.



(a) Prior to Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer, at Sellers sole cost
and expense, an abstract of title to the Ft. Madison Facility continued
through a date within thirty (30) days of Closing and deliver it to Buyer for
examination. The abstract shall show merchantable title in Seller in
conformity with this Agreement, Iowa law and the Title Standards of the Iowa
State Bar Association. The abstract shall be obtained from an abstracter
qualified by the Title Guaranty Division of the Iowa Housing Finance
Authority. The abstract shall become the property of the Buyer upon the
Closing, provided, however, that Buyer reserves the right to occasionally use
the abstract prior to Closing. Seller shall pay the costs of any additional



 

43 abstracting and title work due to any act or omission of Seller. Buyer, at its
expense, may purchase title insurance or a title guaranty from the Title
Guaranty Division of the Iowa Housing Finance Authority. Seller agrees to
reasonably cooperate with Buyer in connection with Buyers efforts to obtain
such insurance or title guaranty, as the case may be. 



(b) As may be necessary to obtain the insurance or title guaranty without a
survey exception, Seller shall assist Buyer in Buyers obtaining, at Buyers
sole cost and expense, an ALTA survey of the Ft. Madison Facility as of a date
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which shall be prepared by a
registered land surveyor reasonably acceptable to Buyer, be certified to the
issuer of the Title Policy and to Buyer pursuant to a certification requested
by Buyer, and show with respect to the Ft. Madison Facility: the legal
description of the Ft. Madison Facility (which shall be the same as the Title
Policy pertaining thereto); all buildings, structures and improvements thereon
and all restrictions of record and other restrictions that have been
established by an applicable zoning or building code or ordinance and all
easements or rights of way across or serving the Ft. Madison Facility
(including any off-site easements affecting or appurtenant thereto); no
encroachments upon the Ft. Madison Facility or adjoining parcels
by buildings, structures or improvements and no other survey defects; access
to such parcel from a public street; and a flood certification reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer to the effect that no portion of the Ft. Madison
Facility is located within a flood hazard area.



6.18 _Confidentiality Agreement; Public Announcement_. The terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement are incorporated into this Agreement by reference
and shall continue in full force and effect and shall survive the Closing,
and, prior to the Closing, no press release or other public announcement with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be made without the express prior approval of Buyer and Seller.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or the Confidentiality Agreement (which is
amended as provided in this _Section 6.18_), (a) from and after the Closing,
Buyers confidentiality obligations and other obligations under this _Section
6.18_ shall terminate with respect to any information relating to
the Business and Buyer shall be entitled to use such information for any
purpose, (b) at any time, Buyer may disclose to any nationally-recognized debt
rating agency any information regarding the Business in connection with
Buyers or its Affiliates debt securities, and the rating agency may
publicly announce any information about the Business in connection with its
rating of Buyers or its Affiliates debt securities (provided that, during
the period prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts
to notify Seller of any such disclosure), and (c) at any time, each of Buyer
and Seller may make any disclosures (including the making of any press
releases and the filing of this Agreement on Form 8-K) required under
Regulations concerning securities law matters if it determines in good faith
that it is required to do so and, with respect to each such disclosure, it
provides the other with prior notice and a reasonable opportunity to review
the disclosure.



6.19 _Release of Encumbrances_. At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall
cause all Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances, then encumbering
the Purchased Assets to be released in full.



 

6.20 _Use of Certain Names_. Within six (6) months after the Closing, Buyer
shall and shall cause its Affiliates to revise all labeling and Sales
Materials so as to discontinue use of the name "The Dial Corporation" and
variations thereof (collectively, the " _Names_ ").



 

44 Notwithstanding that it bears the Names, Buyer shall be entitled to use all
labeling and Sales Materials existing at the Effective Time until the supply
on hand of such has been exhausted. In no event shall Buyer use any of the
Names after the Effective Time in any manner or for any purpose different from
the use of such Names by Seller during the ninety (90) calendar day period
preceding the Closing Date and all such use shall be in a manner so as to
preserve and enhance the quality and goodwill associated with the Names and
The Dial Corporation, provided that any use of such Names that is
substantially the same as the use of such Names by Seller prior to Closing
shall be deemed to preserve and enhance the quality and goodwill associated
with the Names and The Dial Corporation. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
any goodwill resulting from use of the Names by Buyer shall inure to the sole
benefit of Seller. With respect to Inventory manufactured by Seller on or
prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding that it bears the Names, Buyer
may continue to sell such Inventory until such Inventory has been sold.



6.21 _Delivery of Assets_. Within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall have the right, at Buyers expense, to
retrieve from Sellers corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, the
assets listed on _Schedule 4.5_ that are not located at the Ft. Madison
Facility. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyers efforts to retrieve
such assets and, until such assets are retrieved by Buyer, shall maintain such
assets in reasonable condition. If Buyer does not retrieve such assets within
one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
be deemed to have abandoned such assets, and Seller shall be permitted to
dispose of such assets.

_ACTIONS BY SELLER AND BUYER AFTER THE CLOSING_

such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any of them in connection
with the preparation of any return, audit, or other examination by any taxing
authority or judicial or administrative proceedings relating to Liability for
Taxes, (ii) each retain and provide the other with any records or other
information that may be relevant to such return, audit or examination,
proceeding or determination, and (iii) each provide the other with any such
audit or examination, proceeding, or determination that affects any amount
required to be shown on any tax return of the other for any period. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall each
retain, until the applicable statutes of limitations (including any
extensions) have expired, copies of all tax returns, supporting work
schedules, and other records or information that may be relevant to such
returns for all tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date.



9.2 _Employees_. 



(a) _Offers of Employment_. Buyer shall offer to employ all of the Employees
who are listed in _Schedule 4.11_ , with such employment to be effective, if
accepted, (i) as of the Effective Time with respect to such active Employees
or (ii) as of the employees return to work with respect to those Employees
on leave or reinstated as a result of an arbitration award or the Memorandum
of Understanding entered into by Seller and UFCW, Local 617 dated February 22,
2006, provided the employee returns to work within 365 days immediately
following the Effective Time. Such offers of employment to Salaried Employees
shall be on terms and conditions that are reasonably comparable to the terms
and conditions of employment of similarly situated employees of Buyer; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) for a period of twelve (12) months following
the Effective Time, salary levels and (y) through December 31, 2006, bonus
opportunities (as determined under Sellers VERC, a copy of which has been
provided to Buyer), shall in each case be no less favorable to such Salaried
Employees than were available to such Salaried Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time. In addition, as of the Effective Time and
through December 31, 2006, Buyer shall make available to the Salaried
Employees



 

47 medical, vision (at a cost no greater than 50% of the monthly premium charged
to similarly situated employees of Buyer) and dental plans substantially
comparable to the medical, vision and dental plans that Seller made available
to the Salaried Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
welfare benefits for retired employees); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Buyer
shall have no obligation to make available to the Salaried Employees a
medical, vision or dental plan comparable to the Aetna HealthFund Health
Reimbursement Arrangement plan maintained by Seller; and further provided
that to the extent that medical, vision and dental benefits are provided to
Salaried Employees pursuant to the Transition Service Agreement, Buyer will be
deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this sentence. Nothing
herein shall require Buyer to offer an equity-based compensation plan or
program to any Employee. Any Employee who accepts Buyers offer of employment
shall be referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_ " and will be
terminated by Seller at the Effective Time with respect to active Employees
or as of the employees return to work with respect to Employees on leave.
Except as provided below, Buyer will provide Transferred Hourly Employees with
such terms and conditions of employment as are provided under the terms of
the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that welfare
benefits are provided to Hourly Employees pursuant to the Transition Service
Agreement, Buyer will be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of
this sentence. This _Section 9.2(a)_ shall not be construed as guaranteeing
employment to any particular Employee or Transferred Employee or require that
the employment of any Transferred Employee by Buyer be for any specific period
of time. Seller shall support fully Buyers efforts to employ Employees and
shall cooperate fully with Buyer in facilitating the making of such offers to
Employees. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall not, from the date
hereof, offer any material inducements, transfers or promotions or other
business opportunities to any Employee, the acceptance of which would result
in such individual ceasing to perform substantially all of his or her
services for the Business.



(b) _Severance Benefits_. For a period of twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, Buyer shall maintain a severance plan for Transferred Salaried
Employees that provides benefits substantially comparable to the benefits
provided under The Dial Corporation Enhanced Severance Pay Plan For Terminated
Employees as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any severance
obligation to any Employee or other individual who performed services for
the Business and which arises from such persons employment being terminated
by Seller (and regardless of whether an Employee accepts or rejects Buyers
offer of employment) shall be retained by Seller. Any obligations under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and similar laws that arise
prior to the Effective Time, or as a result of Sellers actions in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be retained by
Seller. Any obligations under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act and similar laws that arise after the Effective Time, or as a
result of Buyers actions in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, shall be retained by Buyer.



(c) _Service Credit_. Buyer shall recognize service completed by Transferred
Employees while employed by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller for purposes of
determining eligibility for participation and vesting in Buyers benefit
plans, but not for purposes of benefit accrual. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, Buyer shall recognize service completed by Transferred Salaried
Employees while employed by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller for purposes of
calculating any severance or vacation accrual benefits provided
to Transferred Salaried



 

48 Employees after the Effective Time. Buyer, under Buyers or an Affiliate of
Buyers welfare benefit plans in which the Transferred Employees participate,
shall credit the Transferred Employees with deductibles and co-payments under
Sellers welfare plans for the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs. Buyers or an Affiliate of Buyers welfare plans will not impose any
pre-existing condition exclusions on Transferred Employees, except to the
extent such restrictions were imposed on a Transferred Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time by Seller. Seller shall refund to the Transferred
Employees all amounts paid by such employees under Sellers vacation buy/sell
program that have not been used as of the Effective Time.



(d) _Welfare Plans_. Seller agrees that any claims for welfare benefits
arising on or before the Effective Time with respect to any Employee or
former employee of Seller (and their covered dependents or beneficiaries)
shall be the responsibility of Seller and its welfare benefit plans, and
(except as provided for below) Buyer agrees that any claims for
welfare benefits arising after the Effective Time with respect to Transferred
Employees (and their covered dependents or beneficiaries) shall be the
responsibility of Buyer and its welfare benefit plans. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, welfare benefit claims for a Transferred Employee (and his or her
covered dependents and beneficiaries) who is not an active Employee at the
Effective Time, shall remain the responsibility of Seller and its welfare
benefit plans until such Transferred Employee commences employment with
Buyer. A claim shall be deemed to have arisen when services relating to the
condition that is the subject of the claim were performed; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of an individual who was hospitalized at
the Effective Time, all claims relating to such hospitalization (including,
without limitation, hospital charges and physician fees) shall be deemed to be
claims arising at or before the Effective Time.



(e) _Retiree Medical_. Seller agrees that any claims for retiree
medical benefits (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time and
whether such person retires prior to or after the Effective Time) with respect
to the Employees and Transferred Employees (and their covered dependents and
beneficiaries) who satisfy the age and service requirements for such benefits
on or before September 30, 2007, shall be the sole responsibility of Seller
and its welfare benefit plans, and that Buyer and its welfare benefit plans
shall have no liability for retiree medical benefits for any Employee or
Transferred Employee (or their covered dependents or beneficiaries);
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Buyer offers retiree medical benefits to
Transferred Hourly Employees under the terms of a Collective Bargaining
Agreement for periods after September 30, 2007, Buyer shall be responsible for
any claims for retiree medical benefits attributable to any Transferred Hourly
Employee who satisfies the age and service requirements for such benefits
after September 30, 2007. The parties acknowledge that Sellers employee
benefit plans currently require Transferred Hourly Employees who have
satisfied the eligibility requirements for retiree medical benefits as of the
Effective Time to elect retiree medical benefits upon their termination of
employment with Seller. Seller shall make its reasonable best efforts to amend
its employee benefit plans so that Transferred Hourly Employees who meet the
eligibility requirements for retiree medical benefits by September 30, 2007
(including service with Buyer) can defer retirement from Seller, including the
election of retiree medical benefits, until termination of employment from
Buyer. Buyer agrees to make its reasonable best efforts to advise Seller
within thirty (30) days of the termination of employment of each such eligible
Transferred Hourly Employee.



 

49 (f) _Defined Contribution Plans_. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Seller shall cause matching contributions to be made to The Dial
Corporation Future Investment Plan and The Dial Corporation 401(k) Plan For
Hourly Employees (collectively " _Seller s Savings Plans_") with respect to
all elective deferrals by or on behalf of Transferred Employees relating to
compensation paid to Transferred Employees for services rendered through the
Effective Time. As soon as practicable thereafter, Seller shall cause the
assets held in trust under Sellers Savings Plans equal to the account
balances of the Transferred Employees who were participants in Sellers
Savings Plans to be transferred to the trust under the Pinnacle Foods 401k
Savings Plan for Salaried Employees or the Pinnacle Foods 401k Savings Plan
for Union Employees, as applicable. Buyer represents that any such plan is
qualified under Code Sections 401(a) and 401(k) and that its related trust is
tax exempt under Code Section 501(a). The assets to be transferred shall be in
cash and, to the extent mutually agreed to by Buyer and Seller, a combination
of cash, securities and other property; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
participant loans shall be transferred in kind. The amount transferred from
the trust under Sellers Savings Plans shall be adjusted to reflect any
distributions, contributions or earnings properly attributable to such plan
during the period prior to the transfer date. Prior to such asset transfer,
Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with and assist each other in connection
with the administration of the Sellers Savings Plans and to facilitate such
transfer of assets and the adoption and filing of any documents reasonably
required by such transfer. Notwithstanding the above, the amount transferred
shall in no event be less than the amount necessary to satisfy the
requirements of Code Section 414(l).



(g) _Waiver_. Seller waives any claims against Buyer and the Transferred
Employees arising from any breach of the confidentiality, non-disclosure
or non-compete provisions of any agreement between Seller and a Transferred
Employee entered into prior to the Effective Time, to the extent that such
breach arises directly as a result of the Transferred Employees performance
of services for Buyer in the course of operating the Business.



(h) _Defined Benefit Plans_. Seller shall cause all Transferred Hourly
Employees to become 100% vested in their accrued benefits under any defined
benefit plan maintained by Seller, and Buyer shall assume no liability under
any such plan. Seller shall cause Sellers Labor Pension Program to be liable
for and pay the "30-Year Retirement Pension" benefit to each Transferred
Hourly Employee with thirty years of service under such plan on or prior to
September 30, 2007 (with years of service calculated by including service
recognized by Seller under such plan as well as service with Buyer or an
affiliate of Buyer following the Effective Time).



(i) _Cafeteria Plan_. Buyer shall maintain a welfare benefit plan under Code
Section 125 that includes a medical spending account component and a
dependant care spending account component and Buyer shall assume all
liabilities associated with such accounts with respect to the Transferred
Employees under Sellers Flexible Compensation Plan as of the Effective Time.
Seller shall transfer to Buyer the aggregate account balances of all
Transferred Employees under Sellers Flexible Compensation Plan (including any
unpaid accrued employer matching contributions).



 

50 (j) _Employee Share Program_. As of Effective Time, Seller shall cause all
Transferred Employees to become 100% vested in their Matching Shares under
the Henkel Employee Share Program.



(k) _Special Bonus_. Seller shall be responsible for the payment of any bonus
payable pursuant to a Director LTIP Agreement dated July 1, 2004.



9.3 _Assignment of Intellectual Property_. In accordance with _Section 6.5_,
Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that Seller shall, in a prompt,
commercially reasonable manner, be responsible for the preparation of the
assignment documents for the recordation of the assignment to Buyer of all
non-United States Intellectual Property and non-United States Seller Owned
Trademarks associated with the Purchased Assets. Buyer further acknowledges
and agrees that Buyer shall be solely responsible for recording worldwide of
the assignment documents for the Intellectual Property and Seller Owned
Trademarks associated with the Purchased Assets. Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that such preparation and recording of such assignment documents for
the non-United States Intellectual Property and non-United States Seller Owned
Trademarks will not be completed prior to the Closing Date and Sellers
failure to complete such preparation of the assignment documents of the non-
United States Intellectual Property and non-United States Seller Owned
Trademarks associated with the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing Date
shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or of any of the Ancillary
Agreements. With respect to the three trademark applications currently pending
in the United States Trademark Office filed in the name of Armour Brands,
Inc. (Serial Nos. 78/731895, 78/626877, and 78/572360 for DESSERT BUCKET, THE
ULTIMATE IN THICK, RICH CHILI, and ULTIMATE, respectively), Seller agrees
that, commencing promptly after Closing, Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to transfer legal title of the foregoing trademark applications to
Buyer and to correct any title defect in the three foregoing trademark
applications through the preparation and drafting of petitions, motions,
applications, declarations, briefs, and other papers in support of the
transfer of legal title in the foregoing trademark applications from Armour
Brands, Inc. to Buyer.



ARTICLE X



_SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION_



10.1 _Survival of Representations, Etc._ All representations and warranties of
Seller and Buyer contained herein shall survive the Closing Date and shall
terminate at 11:59 p.m., Central Time, on April 30, 2007; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the representations and warranties contained in _Sections 4.1
and 4.2_ shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations period. Upon the termination of a representation or warranty
in accordance with the foregoing, such representation or warranty shall have
no further force or effect for any purpose under this Agreement, including
_Section 10.2_ hereof, provided that, any representation or warranty in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under _Section 10.2_, and the
indemnity with respect thereto, shall survive the time at which it would
otherwise terminate pursuant to this  _Section 10.1_ if notice of the
inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have
been given to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to
such time and shall thereafter remain in effect until the claim identified in
the notice is finally resolved. The covenants and other agreements of Seller
and Buyer set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date until
fully performed.



 

51 10.2 _Indemnifications_.



(a) _By Seller_. From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify Buyer and
its Representatives and Affiliates, and hold each of them harmless from and
against, any and all Damages incurred by any of them arising out of, resulting
from, relating to or in connection with (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements, or in any certificate (including the certificate delivered
pursuant to _Section 8.4_) furnished or to be furnished to Buyer hereunder or
under any Ancillary Agreements; (ii) any failure by Seller to perform in a
timely manner any agreement, covenant or obligation of Seller pursuant to this
Agreement; and (iii) any Excluded Liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Damages shall not include, and Seller shall not be liable for, any Damages
arising out of any condition which resulted in an adjustment reflected in the
Final Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.5_ or _Section 2.6_ of this
Agreement to the extent of the amount of the adjustment.



(b) _By Buyer_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify Seller and
its Representatives and Affiliates, and hold each of them harmless from and
against, any and all Damages incurred by any of them arising out of, resulting
from, relating to or in connection with (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements, or any certificate (including the certificate delivered pursuant
to _Section 7.4_) furnished or to be furnished to Seller hereunder or under
any Ancillary Agreements; (ii) any failure by Buyer to perform in a timely
manner any agreement, covenant or obligation of Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement; (iii) any Assumed Liability; (iv) any Post-Closing Environmental
Liabilities; and (v) any Liabilities arising out of Buyers operation of the
Business or ownership of the Purchased Assets on and after the Effective Time,
other than any Liabilities for which Buyer or its Representatives or
Affiliates is entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)_.



(c)  _Defense of Claims_. If a claim for Damages (a " _Claim_ ") is to be
made by a party entitled to indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") against the party from whom indemnification is claimed (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable after the
Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition or event which may
give rise to Damages for which indemnification may be sought under this
_Section 10.2_. If any lawsuit or enforcement action is filed against any
party entitled to the benefit of indemnity hereunder, written notice thereof
shall be given to the Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable (and in
any event within ten (10) business days after the service of the citation or
summons). The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely notice hereunder
shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates actual and material prejudice caused
by such failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Claim Notice that relates to
a representation or warranty must be made within the survival period set
forth in _Section 10.1_, whether or not the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced
by any failure to give the Claim Notice. The Claim Notice shall describe in
reasonable detail the nature of the Claim, including, to the extent
reasonably feasible, an estimate of the amount of Damages that have



 

52 been or may be suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Party attributable to
such Claim, the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification
under the Agreement and all information in the Indemnified Partys possession
relating to such Claim. After receipt of such Claim Notice, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled, if it so elects, at its own cost, risk and expense,
(i) to take control of the defense and investigation of such lawsuit or action
and (ii) to employ and engage attorneys of its own choice to handle and defend
the same. If the Indemnifying Party elects to take control of the defense and
investigation of such lawsuit or action, the Indemnifying Party shall conduct
the defense and investigation actively and diligently. If the Indemnifying
Party fails to assume the defense of such Claim within thirty (30) calendar
days after receipt of the Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party against which
such Claim has been asserted will (upon delivering notice to such effect to
the Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake, at the
Indemnifying Partys cost and expense, the defense, compromise or settlement
of such Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Claim shall not, in any event, be
compromised or settled without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Claim, the Indemnifying Party
will keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of the progress of any
such defense, compromise or settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to conduct its own defense at the cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnified Party shall have
reasonably concluded that (i) there may be defenses available to such
Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party, (ii) the Claim seeks an order, injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party which, if successful
would be reasonably likely to materially adversely affect the Business or
financial condition of the Indemnified Party, or (iii) the conduct of its
defense by the Indemnifying Party would reasonably be likely to prejudice the
Indemnified Party due to a conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party; and provided further that in any event the
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense.



(d) _Settlement_. In the event that the Indemnified Party settles any Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying
Party shall have no further indemnification obligations under this _Section
10.2_ with respect to such Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Indemnifying Party refuses to defend or otherwise handle such Claim and it is
subsequently determined that the Indemnifying Party is or was obligated to
defend or indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Claim, then
the Indemnifying Party shall remain obligated with respect to such settlement
amount. If the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any such Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party of any proposed
settlement of such Claim at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to agreeing
to any settlement and shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering
into any settlement of a Claim or ceasing to defend such Claim if (i)
pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or
other equitable relief shall be imposed against the Indemnified Party, (ii)
such settlement or cessation does not expressly and unconditionally release
the Indemnified Party from all Damages with respect to such Claim, without
prejudice, (iii) in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party the
settlement would be reasonably likely to have a materially adverse effect on
the Business or the financial condition of the Indemnified Party, or (iv) the
settlement or cessation imposes any liability on the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnified Party determines



 

53 to withhold its consent to such settlement on the basis of clause (iii) in the
immediately preceding sentence, the Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party that the Indemnified Party is withholding its consent on
such basis within ten (10) calendar days after the Indemnifying Party notifies
the Indemnified Party of such proposed settlement. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party proposes a settlement to any Claim that fulfills the
requirements of clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) above, with respect to which the
Indemnifying Party is or was entitled to defend, which settlement
is satisfactory to the party instituting such Claim, and the Indemnified
Party withholds its required consent to such settlement pursuant to clause
(iii) above, and thereafter a final judgment is entered against the
Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party pursuant to which Damages exceed the
amount of the proposed settlement, then in such case the Indemnifying Party
shall have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this
_Section 10.2_ against and in respect of the amount by which the Damages
resulting from such final judgment exceed the amount of the proposed
settlement.



(e) _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall have an obligation to mitigate
Damages under this Agreement, and to that end each party shall use
its reasonable efforts and shall consult and cooperate with each other with a
view towards mitigating Damages that may give rise to claims for
indemnification under this _Section 10.2_.



(f) _Cooperation_. In the event that any action, suit, proceeding
or investigation relating hereto or to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is commenced, whether before or after the Closing, the parties
hereto agree to cooperate and use reasonable efforts to vigorously defend
against and respond thereto and make available to each other such personnel,
witnesses, books, records, documents or other information within its control
that are necessary or appropriate for such defense (except for trade secrets
and such items which may not be made available pursuant to a Court Order);
_provided_ that, subject to _Section 10.2(c)_, the Indemnifying Party shall
reimburse the Indemnified Party for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provisions
of this Agreement (except for _Section 2.4(b)_ and _Section 2.5_), in the
case of any dispute among the parties hereto, the applicable Regulations
governing information sharing applicable to such dispute shall govern.



(g) _Limitations_.



(i) Neither Buyer nor Seller shall be liable to the other under this 
_Section 10.2_ for any Damages due pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ or
_Section 10.2(b)(i)_ exclusively, unless and until (A) each individual amount
otherwise due the Indemnified Party exceeds Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000)
(excluding legal fees and expenses) (the " _Damages Threshold_ "), and (B) the
aggregate amount of all such Damages under this Agreement due the Indemnified
Party (excluding Damages incurred in any individual claim of less than the
Damages Threshold) exceeds an accumulated total of One Million Dollars
($1,000,000), and thereafter the total amount of all such Damages in excess of
the Damages Threshold per claim (excluding legal fees and expenses) actually
incurred (excluding the first One Million Dollars ($1,000,000)) shall be
indemnifiable. For purposes of determining whether the Damages Threshold has
been met, all Damages arising out of or related to the same event or
circumstance shall be aggregated and together treated as an individual
amount.



 

54 (ii) Neither (A) Sellers aggregate liability under _Sections 10.2(a)(i)_ of
this Agreement for all claims for Damages incurred by Buyer (and its
Representatives and Affiliates) nor (B) Buyers aggregate liability under
_Sections 10.2(b)(i)_ of this Agreement for all claims for Damages incurred by
Seller (and its Representatives and Affiliates), shall in any event exceed,
in either case (A) or (B), ten percent (10%) of the Final Purchase Price;
_provided_ that Sellers aggregate liability under _Section 10.2(a)_ for all
claims for Damages incurred by Buyer (and its Representatives and Affiliates)
and made under _Section 10.2(a)_ shall not in any event exceed the Final
Purchase Price.



(iii) Solely for purposes of calculating the amount of Damages incurred
arising out of or relating to any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty (and not for determining whether a breach has occurred), the
references to "Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality qualifications
(or correlative terms) shall be disregarded.



(h) In no event shall any party be liable for any incidental,
consequential, punitive, indirect or special losses or damages (including,
without limitation, lost profits, lost revenues and loss of business), whether
foreseeable or not, whether occasioned by any failure to perform or the breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation under this
Agreement for any cause whatsoever.



(i) Nothing herein shall relieve either party of any liability to make any
payment expressly required to be made by such party pursuant to this
Agreement.



10.3 _Tax Indemnifications_. Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, when due
all Taxes for which Seller is or may be liable or that are or may become
payable with respect to all taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, other than Taxes for which Buyer is responsible pursuant to _Sections
2.11_ and _2.12_. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its
Affiliates, successors and assigns, from and against any and all Taxes of
Seller for any Taxes in respect of the Purchased Assets and income of the
Business for the period or portions of periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates,
successors and assigns, from and against any and all Taxes of Buyer for any
Taxes in respect of the Purchased Assets and income of the Business for the
period or portions of periods beginning after the Closing Date.



10.4 _Insurance Proceeds; Tax Benefit and Tax Cost_.



(a) With respect to any Claim required to be indemnified pursuant to this
Agreement, so long as the Indemnifying Party has complied with its
indemnification obligations on such Claim, (i) to the extent available, the
Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnifying Party any applicable
proceeds under any insurance policy which covers the matter which is the
subject of the indemnification and shall take reasonable steps to insure that
the Indemnifying Party obtains the benefits of such policy, including
providing any notices as required under such policy; and (ii) if the
Indemnified Party receives insurance proceeds with respect to any Damages paid
by the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the
Indemnifying Party in an amount equivalent to such proceeds up to the amount
actually paid by the Indemnifying Party.



 

55 (b) As contemplated by the definition thereof, the amount of any and all
Damages for which indemnification is provided pursuant to _Article X_ shall
be increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the Indemnified
Party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder, and reduced to
take account of any net Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising
from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any net Tax cost incurred and any net Tax benefit realized shall be
attributable to those Damages taken into account on a Tax return for a year
not later than the year in which the indemnity payment is made. In computing
the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be
deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity
payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any and all Damages.



10.5 _Exclusive Remedy; Fraud_. From and after the Closing, the rights of
Buyer under _Section 10.2_ shall be the exclusive remedy of Buyer with
respect to claims based upon a breach or alleged breach of the
representations, warranties and covenants of Seller contained herein. From and
after the Closing, the rights of Seller under _Section 10.2_ shall be the
exclusive remedy of Seller with respect to claims based upon a breach or
alleged breach of the representations, warranties and covenants of Buyer
contained herein. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither
Seller nor any of its Representatives or Affiliates makes or has made any
representations or warranties, express or implied, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, (i) the
Purchased Assets shall be transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement in
their present condition, "AS IS" and without any warranty, express or implied;
and (ii) no patent or latent physical condition or defect in any of the
Purchased Assets, whether or not now known or discovered, shall affect the
rights of either party. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained herein, the liability of any party under this  _Article X_ shall
be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other liability that such party
may have at law or equity based on such partys fraudulent acts, fraudulent
omissions, or intentional misrepresentations. None of the provisions set
forth in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party to this
Agreement of any right or remedy which such party may have at law or equity
based on any other partys fraudulent acts, fraudulent omissions, or
intentional misrepresentations nor shall any such provisions limit, or be
deemed to limit, (i) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any such
claim for fraud or intentional misrepresentation, (ii) the time period during
which a claim for fraud or intentional misrepresentation may be brought, or
(iii) the recourse which any such party may seek against another party with
respect to a claim for fraud or intentional misrepresentation; _provided_ that
that with respect to such rights and remedies at law or equity, the parties
further acknowledge and agree that none of the provisions of this _Section
10.5_, nor any reference to this _Section 10.5_ throughout this Agreement,
shall be deemed a waiver of any defenses which may be available in respect of
actions or claims for fraud or intentional misrepresentation, including
defenses of statutes of limitations or limitations of damages.



10.6 _Tax Treatment_. Any indemnification payments under this _Article X_
shall be treated to the extent permitted by Regulations applicable to the
Business or to Buyer, for Tax purposes, as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

11.4 _Choice of Law_. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and the
rights of the parties determined in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without reference to its choice of law provisions.



11.5 _Jurisdiction: Services of Process_. Any action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising out of, this Agreement
may be brought against any of the parties in any court of the United States
located in the State of Delaware or in Delaware state court, and each of
the parties consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding and waives any
objection to venue laid therein. Process in any action or proceeding referred
to in the preceding sentence may be served on any party anywhere in the
world.



 

59 11.6 _Entire Agreement: Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, together with all exhibits and schedules hereto and
thereto (including the Disclosure Schedule), and the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the parties pertaining to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. No amendment, supplement, modification
or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the
party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision
hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a
continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.



11.7 _Multiple Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.



11.8  _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, each party
hereto shall pay its own legal, accounting, out-of-pocket and other expenses
incident to this Agreement and to any action taken by such party in
preparation for carrying this Agreement into effect.



11.9 _Invalidity_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Agreement or in any other instrument referred to herein,
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, then to the maximum extent permitted by law, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this
Agreement or any other such instrument so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.



11.10 _Rules of Construction_.



(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has had an opportunity to
be represented by independent counsel of its choice in negotiating this
Agreement. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between the parties shall be deemed
the work product of the parties and may not be construed against any party by
reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this
Agreement against any party that drafted it is of no application and is hereby
expressly waived.



(b) This Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner such that the disclosures
in the Disclosure Schedule shall relate to representations and warranties
in the Section of the Agreement to which they expressly refer and also to any
other representations or warranties in this Agreement as is readily apparent
on the face of such disclosures.



(c) All references in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Articles,
Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the corresponding
Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions of
this Agreement unless expressly



 

60 provided otherwise. Titles appearing at the beginning of any Articles,
Sections, subsections or other subdivisions of this Agreement are for
convenience only, do not constitute any part of such Articles, Sections,
subsections or other subdivisions, and shall be disregarded in construing the
language contained therein. The words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereby,"
"hereunder" and "hereof" and words of similar import, refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular subdivision unless expressly so limited.
The words "this Section," "this subsection" and words of similar import,
refer only to the Sections or subsections hereof in which such words occur.
The word "including" (in its various forms) means "including,
without limitation." Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall
be construed to state and include any other gender and words, terms and titles
(including terms defined herein) in the singular form shall be construed to
include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise expressly
requires. Unless the context otherwise requires, all defined terms contained
herein shall include the singular and plural and the conjunctive and
disjunctive forms of such defined terms. 



11.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiary_. The provisions of this Agreement are for
the benefit only of the parties hereto, and no third party may seek to
enforce, or benefit from, these provisions. The parties specifically disavow
any desire or intention to create any third party beneficiary hereunder,
and specifically declare that no person or entity, except for the parties and
their successors, shall have any right hereunder nor any right of enforcement
hereof.



 

11.12 _No Reliance on Other Information_. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, neither Seller nor any Representative
or Affiliate or other person acting for any of them makes any other
representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to the Purchased
Assets, Business, financial condition or prospects or the execution, delivery
or performance by Seller of this Agreement or with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and Seller hereby disclaims any such
representation or warranty, whether oral or written, whether by Seller or any
of its respective Representatives or Affiliates or any other person. Buyer
acknowledges that none of Seller or any other person has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding Seller not included in
this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule attached hereto, and neither Seller
nor any other person will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer or any
other person resulting from the distribution to Buyer, or Buyers use of, any
such information (including, without limitation, any brochures, offering
memoranda or other publications distributed in connection with the sale of
Purchased Assets or in any presentation by the management of Seller and any
estimates of anticipated performance of the Business.) The representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements and indemnifications provided for in this
Agreement shall be unaffected by any investigation made by or on behalf of any
party hereto.



11.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties recognize that in the event that
Seller should refuse to perform under the provisions of this Agreement,
monetary damages alone will not be adequate to compensate Buyer. Buyer shall
therefore be entitled, in addition to any other remedies which may be
available, including money damages, to seek specific performance of the terms
of this Agreement. Seller shall be entitled to seek specific performance with
respect to any of Buyers obligations arising under this Agreement.



 

61 11.14 _Director and Officer Liability_. The past, present or future directors,
officers, employees and stockholders of Buyer and its Affiliates shall not
have any personal liability or obligation to Seller arising directly under
this Agreement.



11.15 _Passage of Title and Risk of Loss_. Except as expressly provided in
this Agreement, legal title, equitable title and risk of loss with respect to
the Purchased Assets shall not pass to Buyer until the Purchased Assets are
transferred at the Closing.
