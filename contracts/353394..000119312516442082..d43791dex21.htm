iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (together with the Disclosure Letters and
Exhibits hereto, this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of the 26th day of January
2016, by and among Lockheed Martin Corporation, a Maryland corporation ("
_LMC_ "), Abacus Innovations Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned Subsidiary of LMC (" _Spinco_ "), Leidos Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _RMT Parent_ "), and Lion Merger Co., a Delaware corporation
and direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of RMT Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "). Each of
LMC, Spinco, RMT Parent and Merger Sub is sometimes referred to individually
as a " _Party_ " and collectively they are sometimes referred to as the "
_Parties_."

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, LMC, among other things, is engaged, directly and indirectly, in the
Spinco Business and its other businesses;

 

WHEREAS, Spinco is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of LMC and, following the
Internal Reorganization, will be engaged in the Spinco Business; 

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, LMC and
Spinco are entering into the Separation Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, on or prior to the Closing Date, and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Separation Agreement, LMC will consummate the
Internal Reorganization, and following the Internal Reorganization and prior
to the Merger Effective Time, LMC will transfer (the " _Distribution_ ") all
of the issued and outstanding shares of Spincos common stock, $0.001
par value per share (" _Spinco Common Stock_ "), to holders of LMCs common
stock, $1.00 par value per share (" _LMC Common Stock_ ");

 

WHEREAS, in the sole discretion of LMC and subject to the terms and conditions
of the Separation Agreement, the Distribution shall be made (i) without
consideration, by way of a _pro rata_ dividend, or (ii) by way of an offer to
exchange (the " _Exchange Offer_ ") shares of Spinco Common Stock for
currently outstanding shares of LMC Common Stock and, in the event that LMCs
stockholders subscribe for less than all of the Spinco Common Stock in the
Exchange Offer, without consideration and _pro rata_ to holders of LMC Common
Stock, by way of a dividend of any unsubscribed shares of Spinco Common
Stock;

WHEREAS, at the Merger Effective Time, the Parties will effect the merger of
Merger Sub with and into Spinco (the " _Merger_ "), with Spinco continuing as
the surviving corporation, all upon the terms and conditions set forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the
Internal Reorganization, the Spinco Transfer, the Parent Cash Distribution,
the Distribution and the Merger will be treated as contemplated by the Tax
Matters Agreement and, accordingly, that (a) the Spinco Transfer and the
Distribution, taken together, qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and that each of LMC and
Spinco will be a "party to the reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(b) of the Code, (b) the Distribution, as   such, qualifies as a distribution of Spinco Common Stock to LMCs
stockholders pursuant to Section 355 of the Code, (c) the Merger will not
cause Section 355(e) of the Code to apply to the Distribution, (d) the Parent
Cash Distribution qualifies as money distributed to LMC creditors or
stockholders in connection with the reorganization for purposes of Section
361(b) of the Code, and (d) the Merger qualifies as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that each of RMT Parent, Merger
Sub and Spinco will be a "party to the reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(b) of the Code;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of RMT Parent (the " _RMT Parent Board_ ") (a)
has approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the RMT Parent Share Issuance,
and (b) has resolved to recommend the approval by the stockholders of RMT
Parent of the RMT Parent Share Issuance;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Board_ ") (a)
has approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (b) has resolved to recommend
the adoption of this Agreement by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Spinco (the " _Spinco Board_ ") (a) has
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Internal Reorganization, the Spinco
Transfer, the Distribution and the Merger and (b) has resolved to recommend
the adoption of this Agreement by the sole stockholder of Spinco; and

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of LMC (the " _LMC Board_ ") has approved this
Agreement and the Separation Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the Internal Reorganization, the Spinco
Transfer, the Distribution and the Merger;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

_DEFINED TERMS_

 

Section 1.01 _Definitions_.

 

Capitalized terms used in this Agreement have the meanings specified in
_Exhibit A_.

 

ARTICLE II

_THE MERGER_

Section 2.01 _The Merger_.

 

Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or written waiver (where
permissible under Applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in  _Article
VIII_ , and in accordance with the applicable

 



2  provisions of the DGCL, at the Merger Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into Spinco. As a result of the Merger, at the Merger
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease
and Spinco shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

Section 2.02 _Closing; Merger Effective Time_.

 

As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the later of (i) the
third Business Day, after the satisfaction or written waiver (where
permissible under Applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at
the Closing or on the Closing Date (including the Distribution), but subject
to the satisfaction or written waiver (where permissible under Applicable
Law) of those conditions at the Closing), and (ii) the earlier of (A) the date
during the Marketing Period to be specified by RMT Parent on no fewer than two
Business Days notice to LMC (it being understood that such date may be
conditioned upon the simultaneous completion of the Financings), and (B) the
first Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period (unless
another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by LMC and RMT Parent),
the Parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance
with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of such filing of
the Certificate of Merger (or such later time as may be agreed by each of the
Parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the " _Merger
Effective Time_ "). Immediately prior to the filing of the Certificate of
Merger, a closing (the " _Closing_ ") shall be held at the offices of Hogan
Lovells US LLP, Columbia Square, 555 Thirteenth Street, NW, Washington, DC
20004, or such other place as the parties shall agree, for the purpose of
confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the case may be, of the conditions
set forth in _Article VIII_.

 

Section 2.03 _Effects of the Merger_.

 

The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 

Section 2.04 _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) _Conversion of Spinco Common Stock_. At the Merger Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of RMT Parent, Merger
Sub, Spinco or the holders of the Spinco Common Stock, each share of Spinco
Common Stock (all shares of Spinco Common Stock being collectively, the "
_Spinco Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time shall be converted automatically into the right to receive one
fully paid and non-assessable share of RMT Parent Common Stock (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), and each holder of certificates or book-entry shares that
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time represented such Spinco Shares
shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except (i) the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_, in each case to be
issued or paid, without interest, in consideration therefor and (ii) as
provided by Applicable Law.

 



3 (b) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of RMT Parent, Merger Sub,
Spinco or the holders of the Spinco Common Stock, each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) _Exchange Ratio True-Up_ _._ If the condition set forth in _Section
8.03(b)_ would be unable to be satisfied solely because immediately after the
Merger Effective Time, the percentage of outstanding shares of RMT Parent
Common Stock to be received by the former holders of Spinco Common Stock with
respect to Qualified Spinco Common Stock would be less than 50.1% (the "
_Threshold Percentage_ ") of all the stock of RMT Parent (including (i) any
instruments that are treated as stock for U.S. federal income Tax purposes and
(ii) any stock that may be issued after the Merger Effective Time, pursuant
to the exercise or settlement of an option or other contract acquired or
entered into on or before the Merger Effective Time that may be regarded as
having been acquired or entered into before the Merger Effective Time as part
of a "plan" of which the Distribution is a part within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code, determined without regard to any adjustment pursuant to
this _Section 2.04(c)_), including, for the avoidance of doubt, by reason of
the failure of the representation set forth in Section 10(a)(ii) of the Tax
Matters Agreement to be true in all relevant respects (an " _RMT Parent
Capitalization Breach_ "), then the number of shares of Spinco Common
Stock issued pursuant to _Section 2.04(d)_ and converted pursuant to
_Section 2.04(a)_ shall be increased such that the aggregate number of shares
of RMT Parent Common Stock to be received by the former holders of Spinco
Common Stock with respect to Qualified Spinco Common Stock equals the
Threshold Percentage; _provided_ , that no adjustment shall be required
pursuant to this _Section 2.04(c)_ to the extent that any required increase
is the result of a change in Applicable Law between the date of this
Agreement and the Merger Effective Time; and _provided_ , _further_ , that to
the extent any increase required under this _Section 2.04(c)_ is the result
of (x) actions taken by an LMC Entity pursuant to the plan (or series of
related transactions) that includes the Distribution (within the meaning of
Section 355(e) of the Code), or (y) the failure of the LMC Entities to take
commercially reasonable action to prevent such an increase that otherwise
would have been preventable, it being understood and agreed that neither (A)
the mere decision to effect the Distribution by way of an Exchange Offer or
One-Step Spin-Off nor (B) an RMT Parent Capitalization Breach shall be deemed
to be an action or failure to take an action by the LMC Entities for purposes
of clauses (x) and (y), then the amount of the Spinco Special Cash Payment
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the product of $55.2243 multiplied by
the number of additional shares of RMT Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to this _Section 2.04(c)_.

(d)  _Issuance of Shares of Spinco Common Stock_. As contemplated by Section
3.03 of the Separation Agreement, and subject to the adjustment provided in
_Section 2.04(c)_ and _Section 3.01(f)_, on or before the
Distribution Date, Spinco shall issue and deliver to LMC a number of shares
of Spinco Common Stock equal to the difference of (i) the product of (A) the
Exchange Ratio, multiplied by (B) 75,434,980, minus (ii) the number of shares
of Spinco Common Stock held by LMC immediately prior to such issuance
pursuant to Section 3.03 of the Separation Agreement and this _Section
2.04(d)_.

 



4 Section 2.05 _Charter and Bylaws of Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) The charter of Spinco immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of RMT Parent, Merger
Sub, Spinco or the holders of Spinco Common Stock, shall be the charter of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with such charter
and Applicable Law.

 

(b) The bylaws of Spinco immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of RMT Parent, Merger
Sub, Spinco or the holders of Spinco Common Stock, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter duly amended in accordance with the
charter of the Surviving Corporation, such bylaws and Applicable Law.

 

Section 2.06 _Directors and Officers_.

 

The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
and the officers of Spinco immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time
shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified or until such
directors or officers earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

Section 2.07 _Board of Directors/Management of RMT Parent_.

 

(a) The RMT Parent Board shall take all such action as may be necessary (a) to
cause the number of directors comprising the RMT Parent Board as of the
Merger Effective Time to be no more than 13 directors, and (b) to cause three
individuals designated by LMC and reasonably acceptable to the RMT Parent
Board to be appointed to the RMT Parent Board as of the Merger Effective Time
to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of RMT Parent;
_provided_ , that if any of such LMC designees is unable or unwilling to
serve, then LMC shall select a reasonable replacement for such LMC designee.
In connection with the next annual meeting of the stockholders of RMT Parent
following the Merger Effective Time, the RMT Parent Board shall take all such
action as may be necessary to include each of the LMC designees as nominees
for the RMT Parent Board recommended by the RMT Parent Board for election by
RMT Parents stockholders, subject in all events to the fiduciary duties of
the RMT Parent Board of Directors, the requirements of the New York Stock
Exchange and all other Applicable Laws. The RMT Parent Board shall take all
such action as may be necessary to ensure that at least one of such LMC
designees is appointed to serve on each committee of the RMT Parent Board,
subject in all events to the requirements of the SEC, the New York Stock
Exchange and all other Applicable Laws.

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Merger Effective
Time, RMT Parent shall consult from time to time with and consider the views
of LMC regarding the roles and responsibilities of members of the management
of the Spinco Business in the management of RMT Parent and Spinco following
the Closing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the ultimate decision as to the
roles and responsibilities of members of the management of the Spinco Business
following Closing shall be the responsibility of RMT Parent.

 



5 Section 2.08 _The Distribution_.

 

Immediately prior to the Merger, LMC and Spinco shall make the Distribution
pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the
Separation Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in Section 4.02 of the
Separation Agreement to the contrary, in the event LMC elects to effect the
Distribution as the Exchange Offer, LMC shall extend the expiration date of
such Exchange Offer for one or more consecutive increments of not more than

 _CONVERSION OF EQUITY AWARDS_

 

Section 3.01 _Exchange Fund_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, RMT Parent shall
appoint Computershare Trust Company, NA (or another nationally recognized
commercial bank or trust company mutually agreed to by LMC and RMT Parent) to
act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the delivery of the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Article II_ and this  _Article III_.
RMT Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Spinco Shares, for exchange in
accordance with _Section_  

 



6   _2.04_ and this _Article III_ promptly after the Merger Effective Time,
book-entry shares representing the Merger Consideration issuable to holders of
Spinco Shares as of the Merger Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_
(such book-entry shares of RMT Parent Common Stock, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_
and other amounts payable in accordance with _Section 3.01(e)_, the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions from RMT Parent delivered to the Exchange Agent as of the
Closing, deliver the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund as
contemplated by this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be
invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by RMT Parent. Any interest or
other income from such investments of the Exchange Fund shall be paid to and
become income of RMT Parent. Except as contemplated by _Section 3.01(g)_, the
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than as specified in
this _Section 3.01(a)_.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable after the Merger Effective Time, RMT Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to distribute the shares of RMT Parent Common
Stock into which the shares of Spinco Common Stock that were distributed in
the Distribution have been converted pursuant to the Merger to the Persons who
received Spinco Common Stock in the Distribution. Each Person entitled to
receive Spinco Common Stock in the Distribution shall be entitled to receive
in respect of the shares of Spinco Common Stock distributed to such Person a
book-entry authorization representing the number of whole shares of RMT
Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
this _Section 3.01(b)_ (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of RMT Parent
Common Stock, as contemplated by _Section 3.01(e)_, together with any
dividends or distributions and other amounts pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_).
The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to RMT Parent Common Stock held by it from time to time
hereunder, except as contemplated by _Section 3.01(c)_.

(ii) Until exchanged as contemplated by this _Section 3.01_, each Spinco
Share shall be deemed at all times after the Merger Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon surrender of such Spinco Share,
without interest, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of RMT Parent Common Stock that the holder of such Spinco Share may be
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_ and any dividends or other
distributions such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section
3.01(c)_.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Undistributed Shares of RMT Parent Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared after the Merger
Effective Time with respect to RMT Parent Common Stock shall be paid with
respect to any shares of RMT Parent Common Stock that are not able to be
distributed by the Exchange Agent promptly after the Merger Effective Time,
whether due to a legal impediment to such distribution or otherwise. Subject
to the effect of abandoned property, escheat or other Applicable Laws,
following the distribution of any such previously undistributed shares of RMT
Parent Common Stock, there shall be paid to the record holder of such shares
of RMT Parent Common Stock, without interest, (i) at the time of the
distribution, the amount of cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of RMT

 



7  Parent Common Stock to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.01(e)_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of RMT Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Merger Effective Time but prior to the distribution of such
whole shares of RMT Parent Common Stock and a payment date subsequent to the
distribution of such whole shares of RMT Parent Common Stock.

 

(d) _No Further Rights in Spinco Common Stock_. All shares of RMT Parent
Common Stock issued upon the exchange of Spinco Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of _Article II_ and this _Article III_ (including any cash paid
pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ or _Section 3.01(e)_) shall be deemed to have
been issued or paid, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Spinco Common Stock.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of RMT Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Spinco Common Stock, and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote, or
to any other rights of a stockholder of RMT Parent. All fractional shares of
RMT Parent Common Stock that a holder of shares of Spinco Common Stock
otherwise would be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be
aggregated by the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall cause the whole
shares obtained thereby to be sold on behalf of such holders of shares of
Spinco Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional
shares of RMT Parent Common Stock in the Merger, in the open market or
otherwise, in each case at then-prevailing market prices, and in no case later
than five Business Days after the Merger Effective Time. The Exchange Agent
shall pay the net proceeds thereof, subject to the deduction of the amount of
any withholding Taxes as contemplated in _Section 3.01(i)_ and brokerage
charges, commissions and Transfer Taxes, on a _pro rata_ basis, without
interest, as soon as practicable to the holders of Spinco Common Stock
that otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional shares of RMT
Parent Common Stock in the Merger. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional
shares of RMT Parent Common Stock to holders of Spinco Common Stock is solely
for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to RMT Parent of
issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained for
consideration.

 

(f) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
subdivision, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into RMT Parent Common Stock or Spinco Common Stock),
extraordinary cash dividends (other than the RMT Parent Special
Dividend), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to RMT Parent Common
Stock or Spinco Common Stock (other than, in the case of Spinco Common Stock,
to the extent contemplated in the Separation Agreement) with a record date
occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Merger
Effective Time, other than the issuance of stock by Spinco in connection with
the Separation, the Spinco Special Cash Payment, or the other Contemplated
Transactions; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 3.01(f)_ shall be
construed to permit Spinco, RMT Parent or Merger Sub to take any action with
respect to its securities that otherwise is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



8 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed to
the former holders of Spinco Shares on the one-year anniversary of the Merger
Effective Time shall, subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
law, be delivered to RMT Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of
Spinco Shares who have not theretofore received shares of RMT Parent Common
Stock in accordance with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to RMT
Parent for the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.04(a)_, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of RMT Parent Common
Stock to which they may be entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_ and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to the RMT Parent Common Stock
to which they may be entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ (subject to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar law).

 

(h) _No Liability_. None of RMT Parent, LMC, Spinco, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for any
portion of the Exchange Fund (or dividends or distributions with respect to
RMT Parent Common Stock) or any cash delivered to a public official in
accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent, and RMT Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amount as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under Applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Persons otherwise entitled thereto in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

From and after the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Spinco
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of

Spinco Business Employee, shall be converted into RMT Parent RSUs on the same
terms and conditions that governed such LMC Restricted Stock Unit immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time (including in respect of the preservation
of Deferred Dividend Equivalents (as defined in the LMC 2011 IPAP)), as set
forth in the LMC 2011 IPAP and the relevant award agreement in respect
thereof, except that the number of RMT Parent RSUs into which each LMC
Restricted Stock Unit shall be converted will equal the RSU Conversion Ratio.

a Spinco Business Employee and outstanding as of the Merger Effective Time,
without any action on the part of any Party or the Spinco Business Employee,
shall remain outstanding as an LMC Performance Share Unit, shall be eligible

2014 and 2015 and unaudited combined balance sheets as of December 31, 2014
and 2015 of the Spinco Business (collectively, the " _Spinco Financial
Statements_ "). The Spinco Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except as described on _Section 4.07(a)(2)_ of the LMC
Disclosure Letter, applied on a consistent basis, for segment reporting
information in the consolidated financial statements of LMC and do not include
all statements, information (including allocations of overhead expenses
pushdown of certain corporate assets and liabilities such as Taxes) and notes
required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The Spinco Financial
Statements have been prepared using the accounting policies and practices,
applied on a consistent basis, disclosed in the audited annual consolidated
financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of LMC for the
year ended December 31, 2014. The Spinco Financial Statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the combined financial position and the combined
results of operations of the Spinco Business as a segment of LMC, as of the
respective dates thereof or the periods then ended, in each case except as
may be noted therein.

(b) When delivered pursuant to _Section 7.16_, the Spinco Audited Financial
Statements shall present fairly, in all material respects, the combined
financial position and the combined results of operations of the Spinco
Business as of the dates thereof or for the periods covered thereby, and will
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied based on the
historic practices and accounting policies of LMC to the extent compliant with
GAAP (it being understood, however, that the Spinco Business has not been
operating historically as a separate "standalone" entity or reporting segment
and, therefore, the Spinco Audited Financial Statements will reflect certain
adjustments necessary to be presented on a stand-alone basis in accordance
with GAAP and SEC requirements). The Spinco Audited Financial Statements
shall conform in all material respects to the published rules and regulations
of the SEC applicable to financial statements for each of the periods that
will be required to be included in the Registration Statement, the Proxy
Statement or, if applicable, the Schedule TO.

notes thereto, (ii) as specifically contemplated by this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents, or (iii) as set forth in _Section 4.07(c)_ of
LMC Disclosure Letter, since December 31, 2015, the LMC Entities and
the Transferred Subsidiaries have not incurred any Liabilities that will be
liabilities of Spinco or the Transferred Subsidiaries as an Assumed Liability
pursuant to the Separation Agreement and that are of a nature that would be
required to be disclosed on a combined balance sheet of the Spinco Business
or in the notes thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than
Liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business or Liabilities that
would not reasonably be expected to have a Spinco Material Adverse Effect.

(d) LMC maintains, and has maintained, a standard system of accounting
established and administered in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis. LMC and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable

 



15  assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements
general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements of LMC in conformity
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis and to maintain accountability for
assets, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
managements general or specific authorizations and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. To
the knowledge of LMC, since December 31, 2015, neither LMC nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor the JV Entities has identified or been made aware of any
material illegal act or fraud related to the business of the Spinco Business.

 

(e) LMC has timely filed all certifications and statements required by (i)
Rule 13a-14 or Rule 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or (ii) 18 U.S.C. Section
1350 (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) with respect to all
applicable LMC SEC Documents. LMC maintains disclosure controls and procedures
required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, and such
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information
concerning LMC and its Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of LMCs SEC filings and other
public disclosure documents. As used in this _Section 4.07_, the term
"filed" shall be broadly construed to include any manner in which a document
or information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC.

 

(f) LMC has delivered to RMT Parent a true, complete and fully executed copy
of a commitment letter, including (i) all exhibits, schedules, attachments
and amendments to such commitment letter in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and (ii) any associated fee letters (together, the " _Spinco
Commitment Letter_ ") from Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (" _CGMI_ "), The
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (" _BTMU_ "), Bank of America, N.A. ("
_BoA_ "), Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated (" _MLPFS_ "),
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (" _JPMCB_ "), J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC ("
_JPMS_ ") and Goldman Sachs Bank USA (" _GS_ ") (CGMI, BTMU, BoA, MLPFS,
JPMCB, JPMS and GS, together with all additional lenders and financing sources
added to the Spinco Commitment Letter or any Alternative Spinco Commitment
Letter, the " _Spinco Lenders_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, the
Spinco Lenders have committed to Spinco to provide, or cause to be provided,
to Spinco debt financing in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the bank
and/or bond financings, in each case contemplated by the Spinco Commitment
Letter, being referred to as the " _Spinco Financing_ "). As of the date of
this Agreement, (x) the Spinco Commitment Letter has not been amended, waived
or modified and (y) the respective commitments contained in the Spinco
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any
respect. Except for the Spinco Commitment Letter (together with all ancillary
documents referenced therein), there are no side letters or other contracts,
instruments or other commitments, obligations or arrangements (whether written
or oral) related to the funding of the full amount of the Spinco Financing.

(g) The Spinco Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is in full force
and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Spinco and, to the
knowledge of LMC and Spinco, the other parties thereto (in each case, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar
laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and to general
principles of equity). As of the date of this Agreement (assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties and undertakings of RMT Parent and
Merger Sub under this 

 



16  Agreement for such purpose), no event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach on the part of Spinco under any term or condition of the
Spinco Commitment Letter. Other than as set forth in the Spinco Commitment
Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of
the Spinco Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, and subject to the
satisfaction of all the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ and _Section
8.02_, Spinco has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Spinco Financing that are required to be satisfied by it or any other party
to the Spinco Commitment Letter as a condition to the obligations under the
Spinco Commitment Letter will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the
Spinco Financing contemplated by the Spinco Commitment Letter will not be
available to Spinco immediately prior to, or on, the Distribution Date.

Section 4.08 _Absence of Certain Changes_.

 

Since December 31, 2015, there has not occurred any Spinco Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 4.09 _Litigation_.

 

Except as set forth in _Section 4.09_ of the LMC Disclosure Letter, there is
no Proceeding by or against LMC or its Subsidiaries or any JV Entity and
specifically relating to the Spinco Business pending or, to the knowledge of
LMC, threatened in writing that would reasonably be expected to have a Spinco
Material Adverse Effect or would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation by LMC or Spinco of the Contemplated
Transactions.

Section 4.10 _Registration Statements; Proxy Statement; Schedule TO_.

The information supplied by LMC specifically for inclusion or incorporation by

supplement thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders of RMT Parent, (c) the
time of the RMT Parent Stockholders Meeting, (d) the time the Schedule TO is
filed with the SEC or (e) the Merger Effective Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or fail to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. All
documents that LMC and Spinco are responsible for filing with the SEC in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions will comply as to form and
substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation is made by LMC in respect of any information provided by RMT
Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
into the Registration Statements, the Proxy Statement or, if applicable, the
Schedule TO.

 

Section 4.11 _Compliance with Laws_.

 

Since January 1, 2013, LMC and its Subsidiaries have conducted the Spinco
Business in all material respects in compliance with all Applicable Laws and
Governmental Orders applicable to the Spinco Business, and the Spinco Business
is not in material violation of any

 



17  such Applicable Law or Governmental Order. In connection with the Spinco
Business, LMC and the Transferred Subsidiaries have obtained and are, in all
material respects, in compliance with all material Permits that are necessary
to conduct the Spinco Business or to own, lease or operate the Transferred
Assets. This _Section 4.11_ does not apply with respect to the matters that
are the subject of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
4.14_, _Section 4.15_, _Section 4.16_, _Section 4.18_, _Section 4.21_ or
_Section 4.22_.

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 4.12_ of the LMC Disclosure Letter:

 

(i) With respect to all material patents and patent applications and
registrations and applications for trademarks and copyrights included in the
Transferred Intellectual Property, the LMC Entities are the owners of each
such item of Intellectual Property, and all such Intellectual Property is
subsisting, and to the knowledge of LMC, except with respect to applications,
is valid and enforceable;

(ii) To the knowledge of LMC, the conduct of, and the use of the
Transferred Intellectual Property and the Licensed Intellectual Property in
connection with, the Spinco Business as heretofore conducted does not conflict
with, infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate the Intellectual
Property rights of any other Persons, except to the extent that such
conflict, infringement, misappropriation or violation has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Spinco
Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ that LMC makes no representation or
warranty hereunder with respect to any Intellectual Property owned and
provided by a third party (other than LMC or any of its Affiliates) that is
embedded or included in any such Transferred Intellectual Property
or Licensed Intellectual Property;

(iii) To the knowledge of LMC, LMC and the other LMC Entities have taken
reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of all Transferred
Intellectual Property and Licensed Intellectual Property that is considered
confidential or proprietary as of the date of this Agreement (except for such
Transferred Intellectual Property or Licensed Intellectual Property whose
value would not reasonably be expected to be impaired in any material respect
by disclosure), including entering into appropriate confidentiality agreements
with Persons with access to such Transferred Intellectual Property or
Licensed Intellectual Property;

(iv) There is no (A) Proceeding initiated by any other Person pending or, to
the knowledge of LMC, threatened in writing against LMC or any other LMC
Entity (1) concerning the matters described in _Section 4.12(a)(ii)_ or (2)
challenging the validity, enforceability or ownership of any material
Transferred Intellectual Property or material Licensed Intellectual Property;
_provided_ , in each case, that any Proceeding that has been initiated but
with respect to which process or other comparable notice has not been served
on or delivered to LMC or any LMC Entity shall be deemed to be "threatened"
rather than "pending" or (B) Governmental Order against LMC or any LMC Entity
or settlement agreement that an LMC Entity is a party to or, to the knowledge
of LMC, any other Governmental Order or settlement agreement restricting in
any material respect the use or exploitation of any material Transferred
Intellectual Property or material Licensed Intellectual Property; and

 



18 (v) As of the date of this Agreement, and subject to the rights of third
parties in Intellectual Property embedded or included in any Transferred
Intellectual Property and third parties having license rights in Transferred
Intellectual Property, one of the LMC Entities is the sole and exclusive owner
of all right, title and interest in and to all of the Transferred
Intellectual Property, and no current or former Affiliate (other than the
Spinco Companies), partner, director, stockholder, officer, or employee of LMC
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Spinco Companies) will, after giving
effect to the Contemplated Transactions, own or retain any proprietary rights
in any of the material Transferred Intellectual Property.

 

(b) Since January 1, 2013, to the knowledge of LMC, (i) there have been no
security breaches in the information technology systems of, used by or
affecting the Spinco Business, and (ii) there have been no disruptions in any
information technology systems that adversely affected the Spinco Business,
except in each case, as has not had, or would not reasonably be expected

(c) The LMC Entities, in connection with the conduct of the Spinco Business,
have, at all times since January 1, 2013, complied, in all material respects,
with its own posted or otherwise binding privacy policies, relating to
privacy, data protection, or the collection, retention, protection and use
of personal information (" _PII_ ") collected, used, or held for use by or on
behalf of the Spinco Business. No Proceedings have been asserted or, to the
knowledge of LMC, threatened in writing against any LMC Entity, alleging a
material violation of any Persons privacy, personal information or data
rights in relation to the conduct of the Spinco Business that would reasonably
be expected to have a Spinco Material Adverse Effect. In connection with the
operation of the Spinco Business, the LMC Entities take commercially
reasonable measures to protect PII against unauthorized access, use,
modification, disclosure or other misuse.

 

(d) There is no IP License for which the termination thereof or the
restriction or loss of rights thereunder would reasonably be expected to have
a Spinco Material Adverse Effect. Each IP License is valid and binding on the
applicable LMC Entity and, to the knowledge of LMC, the counterparty thereto,
and is in full force and effect, subject to the effect of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Applicable Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally and subject to the effect of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). No
LMC Entity is in material breach of, or material default under, any IP License
to which it is a party.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.05_,  _Section
4.08_, _Section 4.09_, _Section 4.19(a)_ and this _Section 4.12_ are the
only representations and warranties being made by LMC in this Agreement with
respect to the validity of, the right to register, or any activity that
constitutes infringement, misappropriation or other violation of, a third
partys Intellectual Property rights.

 



19 Section 4.13 _Real Property_.

 

(a) _Section 4.13(a)_ of the LMC Disclosure Letter sets forth, with respect
to each parcel of material Spinco Leased Real Property as of the date of this
Agreement, the Contracts that provide an LMC Entity with such rights in or to
Spinco Leased Real Property as of the date of this Agreement (collectively
with the Contracts that provide each LMC Entity with such rights in or
to such Spinco Leased Real Property as of the Closing Date, the " _Spinco
Leases_ "), the address (or other identifying description) of such parcel and
the identity of the lessor, lessee and current occupant (if different from
lessee) of each such parcel. Except to the extent disclosure is limited by
the terms of any Spinco Lease, true, correct and complete copies of all
material Spinco Leases existing as of the date of this Agreement have been
provided to RMT Parent. The applicable LMC Entity (i) has a valid and binding
leasehold interest in each parcel of Spinco Leased Real Property existing as
of the date of this Agreement and (ii) will have a valid and binding leasehold
interest in each parcel of Spinco Leased Real Property that will exist as of
the Closing Date, in each case, free and clear of all Liens other than
Permitted Liens.

(b) No LMC Entity, nor to the knowledge of LMC, any counterparty to any
Spinco Lease is in default in any material respects with respect to any
obligation under the Spinco Leased Real Property. Except as otherwise
indicated on _Schedule 4.13(a)_ of the LMC Disclosure Letter, no LMC Entity
has subleased or granted to a third party any right to use or occupy all or
any portion of the Spinco Leased Real Property.

 

(c) _Section 4.13(c)_ of the LMC Disclosure Letter sets forth the address and
parcel number of each parcel of Spinco Owned Real Property. An LMC Entity has
good and marketable fee simple title in and to each parcel of Spinco Owned
Real Property, including all of the buildings and improvements thereon, free
and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens. There are no outstanding
options, rights of first offer or rights of first refusal to purchase any
Spinco Owned Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein. Other
than pursuant to easements of record, no LMC Entity has leased or granted any
right to use or occupy all or any portion of a Spinco Owned Real Property to
a third party. There is no condemnation or other proceeding in eminent domain
pending or, to the knowledge of LMC, threatened, affecting the Spinco Owned
Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein.

Section 4.14 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) _U.S. LMC Plans and Material Documents_. _Section 4.14(a)_ of the LMC
Disclosure Letter lists, as of the date of this Agreement, all material U.S.
LMC Plans. U.S. LMC Plans shall mean: "employee benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" _ERISA_ "), whether or not subject to ERISA), all bonus, stock
option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred compensation,
retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement, severance or other
compensation or benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all employment,
termination, severance, retention or other contracts or agreements, (i) to
which an LMC Entity is a party, with respect to which an LMC Entity has any
obligation or which are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by an
LMC Entity, in each case, for the benefit of any U.S. Spinco Business
Employee or to which any U.S. Spinco Business Employee is a party or (ii) to
which a Spinco Company is a party, with respect to which a Spinco Company has
any obligation or which are

 



20  maintained, contributed to or sponsored by a Spinco Company, in each case,
for the benefit of any U.S. Spinco Business Employee or to which any U.S.
Spinco Business Employee is a party.  _Section 4.14(a)_ of the LMC
Disclosure Letter indicates by an asterisk those U.S. LMC Plans that are
maintained, contributed to or sponsored solely by a Spinco Company (each, a "
_U.S. Spinco Plan_ "). With respect to each U.S. LMC Plan, LMC has made
available to RMT Parent (to the extent applicable) (i) a true and complete
copy of the current plan document and any material amendments thereto, (ii)
copies of (1) the most recent summary plan description and any summaries of
material modifications thereto and (2) the most recent annual report on Form
5500 (including any applicable schedules and attachments thereto) filed with
the Department of Labor, and (iii) the most recent determination or opinion
letter received from the IRS (if any).

(b) _Non-U.S. LMC Plans and Material Documents_. _Section 4.14(b)_ of
the LMC Disclosure Letter lists, as of the date of this Agreement, all
material Non-U.S. LMC Plans. Non-U.S. Spinco Plans shall mean employee benefit
plans, bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive,
deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental
retirement, severance or other compensation or benefit plans, programs or
arrangements, and all employment, termination, severance or other contracts or
agreements, (i) to which an LMC Entity is a party, with respect to which an
LMC Entity has any obligation or which are maintained, contributed to or
sponsored by an LMC Entity, in each case, for the benefit of any Non-U.S.
Spinco Business Employee or to which any Non-U.S. Spinco Business Employee
is a party (other than statutory plans) or (ii) to which a Spinco Company is
a party, with respect to which a Spinco Company has any obligation or which
are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by a Spinco Company, in each case,
for the benefit of any Non-U.S. Spinco Business Employee or to which any
Non-U.S. Spinco Business Employee is a party (other than statutory plans)
("LMC Plans shall mean U.S. LMC Plans and Non-U.S. LMC Plans). _Section
4.14(b)_ of the LMC Disclosure Letter indicates by an asterisk those Non-U.S.
LMC Plans that are maintained, contributed to or sponsored solely by a Spinco
Company (each, a " _Non-U.S. Spinco Plan_ "). With respect to each Non-U.S.
LMC Plan, LMC has made available to RMT Parent (to the extent applicable) (i)
a true and complete copy of the current plan document and any material
amendments thereto and (ii) copies of the most recent summary plan description
and any summaries of material modifications thereto.

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 4.14(c)_ of the LMC Disclosure Letter,
each LMC Plan (and any related trust or other funding vehicle) has been
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and as
applicable is in compliance in all material respects with ERISA, the Code and
all other material Applicable Laws. Each of LMC and its Subsidiaries is in
compliance in all material respects with ERISA, the Code and all other
material Applicable Laws. All employer and employee contributions required to
have been made by LMC to each U.S. LMC Plan have, in all material respects,
been timely made. There is no material Proceeding pending, or to the
knowledge of LMC threatened, with respect to any U.S. Spinco Plan, other than
ordinary course claims for benefits. Each U.S. Spinco Plan that is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the IRS, or an application for a
favorable determination by the IRS has been timely filed and is currently
pending, and, to the knowledge of LMC, nothing has occurred that would
reasonably be expected to result in a loss of the Tax-qualified status of such
U.S. Spinco Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. To the knowledge of LMC, no
UK Spinco Business Employee has any claim or right in respect of any benefits
payable on early retirement or redundancy under any occupational pension
scheme which claim or right has transferred to LMC or will transfer to Spinco
on or after the Distribution Date pursuant to the Transfer Regulations.

 



21 (d) No Liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by
LMC or any Person that is a member of a "controlled group of corporations"
with, or is under "common control" with, or is a member of the same
"affiliated service group" with LMC, in each case, as defined in Sections
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") that has
not been satisfied in full, and, to the knowledge of LMC, no condition exists
that presents a material risk to LMC or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any
such liability, other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (which premiums have been paid when due). No U.S. LMC
Plan that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code (a " _Title IV Plan_ ") or any trust established thereunder has incurred
any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and
Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the
most recent fiscal year of each Title IV Plan ended prior to the Closing.
Neither LMC nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has, within the preceding six
years, withdrawn in a complete or partial withdrawal from any "multiemployer
plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or incurred any liability under
Section 4204 of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full.

 

(e) Each Non-U.S. LMC Plan has been administered in compliance in all material
respects with its terms and operated in compliance in all material respects
with Applicable Laws. Each Non-U.S. LMC Plan required to be registered or
approved by a non-U.S. governmental entity has been so registered or approved
and has been maintained in good standing with applicable
regulatory authorities, and, to the knowledge of LMC, no event has occurred
since the date of the most recent approval or application therefor relating to
any such Non-U.S. LMC Plan that could reasonably be expected to materially
affect any such approval relating thereto or increase the costs relating
thereto in a manner material to LMC. Each Non-U.S. LMC Plan is funded or
insured in material compliance with Applicable Law. LMCs Israeli Affiliated
Transferors Liability towards the Israeli Employees regarding severance pay,
accrued vacation and contributions to all Funds are fully funded or, if not
required by any source to be fully funded, are accrued on LMCs Israeli
Affiliated Transferors financial statements as of the date of such financial
statements. LMCs Israeli Affiliated Transferor specifically declares that the
employment agreements of all Israeli Employees duly adopted the terms and
conditions detailed in the general approval of the Minister of Labor
regarding payments by employers to a pension fund and insurance fund in lieu
of severance pay in accordance with Section 14 of the Severance Pay Law, 1963
as of their start date of employment and based on their full determining
salary for purposes of severance pay, and accordingly the LMC Israeli
Affiliated Transferors contributions to the severance component within the
Funds of the Israeli Employees fully satisfy its severance pay liability
towards the Israeli Employees for the period of their employment up to the
Distribution Date.

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 4.14(f)(1)_ of the LMC Disclosure
Letter, none of the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents, the
Internal Reorganization, the Distribution or the consummation of the Merger or
any other Contemplated Transaction (alone or in conjunction with any other
event, including any termination of employment) will (i) entitle any Spinco
Business Employee to any material compensation or benefit, (ii) accelerate the

 



22  time of payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding, of any
material compensation or benefit or trigger any other material obligation
under any LMC Plan, or (iii) result in any breach or violation of or default
under, or limit LMCs right to amend, modify or terminate, any LMC Plan, in
each case except as provided in this Agreement or the Employee Matters
Agreement or pursuant to Applicable Law. Except as disclosed in  _Section
4.14(f)(2)_ of the LMC Disclosure Letter, no amounts payable under the LMC
Plans will fail to be deductible for federal income Tax purposes by virtue of
Section 280G of the Code as a result of the occurrence of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, either alone or in combination with another
event.

Section 4.15 _Labor Matters_. 

_Section 4.15_ of the LMC Disclosure Letter lists, as of the date of this
Agreement, each collective bargaining agreement or similar labor agreement
that is applicable to any Spinco Business Employee as of the date of this
Agreement, including Union Employees, to which an LMC Entity (excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, the JV Entities) is a party, including arrangements
with works councils and other similar employee representative bodies
representing any Spinco Business Employee (together with such collective
bargaining agreements, the " _LMC Union Contracts_ "). LMC complies in
all material respects with all such LMC Union Contracts. LMC has made
available to RMT Parent each LMC Union Contract and, if not covered by such
LMC Union Contracts, a list of all unions, works councils and similar employee
representative bodies representing any Spinco Business Employee. As of the
date hereof, (a) there are no material strikes or lockouts with respect to any
Union Employees pending, or to the knowledge of LMC, threatened in writing,
(b) there is no material union organizing effort pending or, to the knowledge
of LMC, threatened in writing against the Spinco Business, (c) there is no
material unfair labor practice, labor dispute (other than routine individual
grievances) or labor arbitration proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of
LMC, threatened in writing affecting the Spinco Business and (d) there is no
material slowdown, or work stoppage in effect or, to the knowledge of LMC,
threatened in writing with respect to the Spinco Business Employees,
including Union Employees. Each of LMC and its Subsidiaries conduct, and since
January 1, 2013 have conducted, the Spinco Business, in all material respects,
in compliance with all material Applicable Laws with respect to
labor relations, employment and employment practices, including occupational
safety and health standards. To the knowledge of LMC, as of the date of this
Agreement, no Spinco Business Employee at a Level 8 or above is in material
violation of any term of any employment or nondisclosure agreement, fiduciary
duty or restrictive covenant for the benefit of LMC or a former employer of
any such employee.

 

Section 4.16 _Taxes_. Except as set forth in _Section 4.16_ of the LMC
Disclosure Letter,

 

(a) all material Tax Returns required to have been filed by, or with respect
to, the Transferred Subsidiaries have been timely filed (taking into account
any valid extension of time to file granted or obtained) and all such Tax
Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects;

 

(b) all material Taxes required to be paid on such Tax Returns have been paid
in full or will be timely paid in full;

 



23 (c) no deficiency or other claim for any material amount of Tax has been
asserted or assessed by a Governmental Authority in writing against any of
the Transferred Subsidiaries that has not been satisfied by payment, settled
or withdrawn;

 

(d) there are no material Tax liens on any Transferred Subsidiary (other than
Permitted Liens);

 

(e) no Transferred Subsidiary has distributed stock of another Person or had
its stock distributed by another Person in a transaction (other than the
Distribution or a transaction effected in connection therewith, including the
Internal Reorganization) that was intended to be governed in whole or in part
by Section 355 of the Code in the two years prior to the date of
this Agreement;

(f) none of LMC, its Subsidiaries or the Transferred Subsidiaries has taken or
agreed to take any action that would (and none of them is aware of any fact,
event, agreement, plan or other circumstance that would) prevent either (i)
the Merger or (ii) the Spinco Transfer and Distribution from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or
otherwise prevent the Tax-Free Status of the External Transactions;

(g) none of LMC, its Subsidiaries or the Transferred Subsidiaries has
participated in a "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
regulations section 1.6011-4; and

 

(h) none of the Transferred Subsidiaries is bound by any material agreement or
arrangement the primary purpose of which relates to Taxes (other than (i)
such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among LMC and its
Subsidiaries and (ii) the Tax Matters Agreement).

 

Section 4.17 _Spinco Material Contracts_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 4.17_ of the LMC Disclosure Letter and
except for (x) Contracts that do not constitute Transferred Assets or Assumed
Liabilities, and (y) Government Contracts, which are covered in _Section

documents. As used in this _Section 5.06(b)_, the term "filed" shall be
broadly construed to include any manner in which a document or information is
furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC.

 



35 (c) RMT Parent maintains, and has maintained, a standard system of accounting
established and administered in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis. RMT Parent and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i)

of a commitment letter, including (i) all exhibits, schedules, attachments and
amendments to such commitment letter in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and (ii) any associated fee letters (together, the "
_RMT Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Spinco Commitment Letter,
the " _Commitment Letters_ ") from CGMI, BTMU, BoA, MLPFS, JPMCB, JPMS and GS
(CGMI, BTMU, BoA, MLPFS, JPMCB, JPMS and GS (together with all additional
lenders and financing sources added to the RMT Commitment Letter or any
Alternative RMT Commitment Letter, the " _RMT Lenders_ " and, together with
the Spinco Lenders, the " _Lenders_ "), pursuant to which, among other things,
the RMT Lenders have committed to RMT Parent and RMT Inc. to provide or cause
to be provided to RMT Inc. debt financing in the aggregate amount set forth
therein (the bank and/or bond financings, in each case contemplated by the RMT
Commitment Letter, being referred to as the " _RMT Financing_ "; the RMT
Financing together with the Spinco Financing, the " _Financings_ "). As of the
date of this Agreement, (x) the RMT Commitment Letter has not been amended,
waived or modified and (y) the respective commitments contained in the RMT
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any
respect. Except for the RMT Commitment Letter (together with all ancillary
documents referenced therein), there are no side letters or other contracts,
instruments or other commitments, obligations or arrangements (whether written
or oral) related to the funding of the full amount of the RMT Financing.

 

(e) The RMT Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is in full force and
effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of RMT Parent and, to the
knowledge of RMT Parent, the other parties thereto (in each case, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and to general
principles of equity). As of the date of this Agreement (assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties and undertakings of each of LMC
and Spinco under this Agreement for such purpose), no event has occurred that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected
to constitute a default or breach on the part of RMT Parent under any term or
condition of the RMT Commitment Letter. RMT Parent has fully paid any and all
commitment fees, any other fees or any other amounts required by the RMT
Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. At the
Closing, assuming the RMT Financing is funded in accordance with the RMT
Commitment Letter, the proceeds of the RMT Financing will be sufficient to
finance the RMT Parent Special Dividend and to pay all related

 



36  fees and expenses associated therewith. Other than as set forth in the RMT
Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the funding of the
full amount of the RMT Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, and
subject to the satisfaction of all the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_
and _Section 8.03_, RMT Parent has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the RMT Financing that are required to be satisfied by it or
any other party to the RMT Commitment Letter as a condition to the obligations
under the RMT Commitment Letter will not be satisfied on a timely basis or
that the RMT Financing contemplated by the RMT Commitment Letter will not be
available to RMT Inc. immediately prior to, or on, the Closing Date.

(f) Upon the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of LMC and Spinco contained in
_Article IV_ , (i) RMT Parent will not be insolvent, (ii) RMT Parent will not
be left with unreasonably small capital, (iii) RMT Parent will not have

filing with the SEC in connection with the Contemplated Transactions will
comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding

respect of any information provided by LMC or Spinco specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference into the Registration Statements,
the Proxy Statement or, if applicable, the Schedule TO.

secure the RMT Parent Stockholder Approval. RMT Parent agrees that it shall

Section 7.03 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

 

(a) RMT Parent agrees that it will not, nor will it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, and that it will instruct its Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information), or take any other
action to knowingly facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or
offer (including any proposal or offer to RMT Parents stockholders), with
respect to any Competing RMT Parent Transaction, (ii) enter into, maintain,
continue or otherwise engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations

agree to, approve, endorse, recommend or consummate any Competing RMT Parent
Transaction, (iv) enter into any Competing RMT Parent Transaction Agreement
or (v) resolve, propose or agree, or authorize or permit any Representative,
to do any of the foregoing. RMT Parent acknowledges and agrees that it shall
be responsible for the actions of its Subsidiaries and Representatives. RMT
Parent acknowledges and agrees that the taking of any of the actions
contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) through (v) by RMT Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach by RMT Parent of this
_Section 7.03(a)_. RMT Parent acknowledges and agrees that if any of its
Representatives takes any actions that, if taken by RMT Parent, would
constitute a breach of this _Section 7.03_, such actions shall be attributed
to RMT Parent and RMT Parent shall be responsible. RMT Parent shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons (other than LMC and its Affiliates) conducted
prior to the execution of this Agreement by RMT Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives with respect to a Competing RMT Parent
Transaction. RMT Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
and RMT Parent shall instruct its Representatives not to, release any third
party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or, subject to
applicable fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, standstill agreement to
which it or one of its Affiliates is a party in connection with a Competing
RMT Parent Transaction. RMT Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
promptly request each Person (other than LMC and its Affiliates) that
has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with RMT Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with such Persons consideration of a Competing
RMT Parent Transaction (whether by merger, acquisition of stock or assets or
otherwise), to return (or if permitted by the applicable confidentiality
agreement, destroy) all information required to be returned (or, if
applicable, destroyed) by such Person under the terms of the applicable
confidentiality agreement and, if requested by LMC, to enforce such Persons
obligation to do so.

 



58 (b) RMT Parent shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after RMT
Parent attains knowledge thereof) notify LMC, orally and in writing, after
the receipt by RMT Parent or any of its Representatives of any proposal,
inquiry, offer or request (or any amendment thereto) with respect to a
Competing RMT Parent Transaction, including any request for discussions or
negotiations and any request for information relating to RMT Parent or any of
its Affiliates or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of RMT Parent or any of its Affiliates. Such notice shall indicate
the identity of the Person making such proposal, inquiry, offer or request and
a description of such proposal, inquiry, offer or request, including the terms
and conditions (if any) of such proposed Competing RMT Parent Transaction, and
RMT Parent shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt by
RMT Parent) provide to LMC copies of any written materials received by RMT
Parent in connection with any of the foregoing. RMT Parent agrees that it
shall keep LMC reasonably informed of the status and material details of
(including discussions with respect to or amendments or proposed amendments
to) (i) any such proposal, inquiry, offer or request and (ii) any information
requested of or provided by RMT Parent pursuant to _Section 7.03(c)_. RMT
Parent shall provide LMC with at least 48 hours prior notice of any meeting of
the RMT Parent Board at which the RMT Parent Board is reasonably expected to
consider any proposal, inquiry, offer or request with respect thereto (or any
lesser advance notice otherwise provided to members of the RMT Parent Board in
respect of such meeting). RMT Parent agrees that it shall substantially
simultaneously provide to LMC any non-public information concerning RMT
Parent that may be made available pursuant to _Section 7.03(c)_ to any other
Person in response to any such proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any
amendment thereto) unless such information has previously been provided or
made available by RMT Parent to LMC.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.03_, at any
time prior to the receipt of the RMT Parent Stockholder Approval, RMT Parent
may furnish information to, and enter into discussions and negotiations with,
a Person who has made an unsolicited, written, bona fide proposal or offer
with respect to a Competing RMT Parent Transaction that did not arise or
result from any breach of this _Section 7.03_ if, prior to furnishing such
information and entering into such discussions, the RMT Parent Board has (i)
determined, in its good faith judgment (after consulting with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) that
such proposal or offer constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Superior Proposal and has determined, in its good faith judgment (after
consulting with outside legal counsel) that the failure to furnish such
information to, or enter into such discussions with, the Person who made such
proposal or offer would be inconsistent with the RMT Parent Boards fiduciary
duties to RMT Parent and/or its stockholders under Applicable Law, (ii)
provided written notice to LMC of its intent to furnish information or enter
into discussions with such Person at least three Business Days prior to taking
the first of any such action with respect to any given Person and (iii)
obtained from such Person an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and any related
agreements shall not include any provision granting such Person exclusive
rights to negotiate with RMT Parent or having the effect of prohibiting RMT
Parent from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement) and, immediately
upon its execution, delivered to LMC a copy of such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 7.03(d)_, neither the RMT Parent
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, modify, amend or
fail to make, or propose

 



59  publicly to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend the RMT Parent
Recommendation, (ii) make any public statement or take any action inconsistent
with the RMT Parent Recommendation or (iii) approve or adopt, or recommend
the approval or adoption of, or publicly propose to approve or adopt, any
Competing RMT Parent Transaction (any of the actions described in (i), (ii) or
(iii), a " _Change in the RMT Parent Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing:

(i) the RMT Parent Board may make a Change in the RMT Parent Recommendation
if (A) other than in connection with or as a result of the making of a
Competing RMT Parent Transaction, a material development or change in
circumstances that was not known or reasonably foreseeable (or if known or
reasonably foreseeable, the probability or magnitude of consequences of which
were not known or reasonably foreseeable) to the RMT Parent Board on the date
of this Agreement occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement, which
material development or change in circumstances becomes known to the RMT
Parent Board prior to the RMT Parent Stockholders Meeting (such material
development or change in circumstances being referred to as an " _Intervening
Event_ " (it being understood that in no event shall (i) any action taken by
any Party pursuant to and in compliance with the affirmative covenants set
forth in _Article VI_ , or any action taken or omitted with the consent of RMT
Parent (in the case of actions taken or omitted by LMC or Spinco) or any
action taken or omitted by RMT Parent, and the consequences of any such action
or omission, or (ii) the receipt, existence of or terms of a Competing RMT
Parent Transaction constitute an Intervening Event), (B) the RMT Parent Board
determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with its outside legal
counsel, that an Intervening Event has occurred; (C) the RMT Parent Board does
not effect, or cause RMT Parent to effect, a Change in the RMT Parent
Recommendation at any time within three business days after LMC receives
written notice from RMT Parent that the RMT Parent Board has determined that
an Intervening Event requires the RMT Parent Board to effect, or cause RMT
Parent to effect, a Change in the RMT Parent Recommendation (provided, a new
notice shall be required with respect to any change in circumstances and a new
notice period of three business days shall begin); (D) during such applicable
period, if requested by LMC, RMT Parent engages in good faith negotiations,
and directs its financial advisors and outside legal advisors to, engage in
good faith negotiations, with LMC to amend this Agreement in such a manner
that obviates the need for the RMT Parent Board to effect, or cause RMT
Parent to effect, a Change in the RMT Parent Recommendation as a result of
such Intervening Event; and (E) the RMT Parent Board determines in good faith,
after having consulted with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Intervening Event, a failure to make a Change in the RMT Parent Recommendation
would be inconsistent with the RMT Parent Boards fiduciary duties to RMT
Parent or its stockholders under Applicable Law; or

 

(ii) if at any time prior to the receipt of the RMT Parent Stockholder
Approval and in response to the receipt of an offer or proposal with respect
to a Competing RMT Parent Transaction that did not arise or result from any
breach of this _Section 7.03_, the RMT Parent Board determines in its good
faith judgment (after consulting with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel), that such offer or proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and determines in its good faith judgment
(after consulting with outside legal counsel) that the failure by the RMT
Parent Board to make a Change in the RMT Parent Recommendation with respect

 



60  to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
RMT Parent and its stockholders under Applicable Law, the RMT Parent Board
may, with respect to such Superior Proposal, make a Change in the RMT Parent
Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the RMT Parent Board shall not
be entitled to exercise its right to make a Change in the RMT Parent
Recommendation pursuant to this  _Section 7.03(d)(ii)_ unless:

(1) RMT Parent has provided written notice to LMC (a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") advising LMC that the RMT Parent Board has received a
Superior Proposal promptly after the RMT Parent Board determines it has
received a Superior Proposal, stating that the RMT Parent Board intends to
make a Change in the RMT Parent Recommendation describing the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal; and

(2) LMC does not, within five Business Days of receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal (the " _Notice Period_ "), make an offer or proposal to
revise the terms of this Agreement (any such offer, a " _Revised Transaction
Proposal_ ") in a manner that the RMT Parent Board determines in its good
faith judgment, after consulting with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, to be at least as favorable
to RMT Parents stockholders as such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, during the Notice Period, RMT Parent shall negotiate in good
faith with LMC (to the extent LMC desires to negotiate) regarding any Revised
Transaction Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that any amendment to the
terms of such Superior Proposal during the Notice Period shall require a new
written notice of the terms of such amended Superior Proposal from RMT Parent
and an additional three Business Day Notice Period that satisfies this 
_Section 7.03(d)(ii)(2)_, including with respect to RMT Parents obligations
to negotiate in good faith with LMC.

(e) Any disclosure that the RMT Parent Board may be compelled to make with
respect to the receipt of a proposal or offer with respect to a Competing RMT
Parent Transaction or otherwise consistent with its fiduciary duties to RMT
Parent and its stockholders under Applicable Law or Rule 14d-9 or with Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act will not constitute a violation of
this _Section 7.03_; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the RMT Parent
Board nor any committee thereof shall make a Change in the RMT Parent
Recommendation in connection with such disclosure (it being understood that
any "stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of RMT Parent
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a Change in the RMT Parent
Recommendation) unless permitted by _Section 7.03(d)_. Any Change in the RMT
Parent Recommendation shall not change the approval of the RMT Parent Board
for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other Applicable Law to
be inapplicable to the Contemplated Transactions.

(f) LMC agrees that it will not, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, and that it will instruct its Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information), or take any other action to knowingly
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including
any proposal or offer to LMCs stockholders), with respect to any Competing
Spinco Transaction, (ii) enter into, maintain, continue or otherwise
engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person or
entity in furtherance of inquiries or to obtain a

 



61  proposal or offer with respect to a Competing Spinco Transaction, (iii)
agree to, approve, endorse, recommend or consummate any Competing Spinco
Transaction or (iv) enter into any Competing Spinco Transaction Agreement.
LMC acknowledges and agrees that it shall be responsible for the actions of
its Subsidiaries and Representatives. LMC acknowledges and agrees that the
taking of any of the actions contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i)
through (iv) by LMC or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach
by LMC of this _Section 7.03(f)_. LMC acknowledges and agrees that if any of
its Representatives takes any actions that, if taken by LMC, would constitute
a breach of this _Section 7.03_, such actions shall be attributed to LMC and
LMC shall be responsible. LMC shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
shall instruct its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other
than RMT Parent and its Affiliates) conducted prior to the execution of this
Agreement by LMC or any of its Representatives with respect to a Competing
Spinco Transaction. LMC shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
and LMC shall instruct its Representatives not to, release any third party
from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or, subject to applicable
duties of its directors under Applicable Law, standstill agreement to which
it or one of its Affiliates is a party in connection with a Competing Spinco
Transaction. LMC shall, and shall cause it Subsidiaries to, promptly request
each Person (other than RMT Parent and its Affiliates) that has heretofore
executed a confidentiality agreement with LMC or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with such Persons consideration of a Competing Spinco Transaction
(whether by merger, acquisition of stock or assets or otherwise), to return
(or if permitted by the applicable confidentiality agreement, destroy) all
information required to be returned (or, if applicable, destroyed) by such
Person under the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement and,
if requested by RMT Parent, to enforce such Persons obligation to do so. LMC
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after LMC attains knowledge
thereof) notify RMT Parent, orally and in writing, after the receipt by LMC or
any of its Representatives of any proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any
amendment thereto) with respect to a Competing Spinco Transaction, including
any request for discussions or negotiations and any request for information
relating to LMC or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Spinco Business,
or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of LMC or
any of its Affiliates with respect to the Spinco Business. The receipt by LMC
of a proposal in respect of a Competing Spinco Transaction shall not in any
way or manner alter, hinder or delay LMC or Spinco from satisfying its
obligations under this Agreement.

communication, without the specific prior written authorization of LMC.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, LMC shall not be
required to provide any access or disclose any information to RMT Parent or
its Representatives if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to (A)
jeopardize, or result in a loss or waiver of, any attorney-client or other
legal privilege, (B) contravene any Applicable Law, fiduciary or other duty
or any agreement or (C) result in the loss of protection of any proprietary
information or trade secrets of any LMC Entity. When accessing any of LMCs
properties, RMT Parent shall, and shall instruct its Representatives to,
comply with all of LMCs safety and security requirements for the applicable
property. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (I) in
no event shall LMC be required to provide any information relating to any

and shall cause its Representatives to, comply with all of RMT Parents or
its Affiliates safety and security requirements for the applicable property.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither LMC nor
any of its Representatives shall be allowed to sample or analyze any soil or

sole discretion of RMT Parent.

 



63 Section 7.05 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

 

(a) The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth in the bylaws of
Spinco, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six years from the Merger Effective Time in any manner that
could reasonably be expected to affect adversely the rights thereunder
of individuals who, at or prior to the Merger Effective Time, were directors,
officers, employees or agents of Spinco, unless such modification shall be
required by Applicable Law.

 

(b) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any Person, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at RMT
Parents option, RMT Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 7.05_.

 

Section 7.06 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_.

 

(a) Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable
commercial efforts to (i) promptly obtain all authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities that may be or become
necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its
obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, (ii) cooperate fully with the other Parties in promptly seeking to
obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals and (iii)
provide such other information to any Governmental Authority as such
Governmental Authority may reasonably request in connection herewith. Each
Party agrees to, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, make promptly
its respective filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Laws under which filing is required or under which the Parties
reasonably mutually determine that filing is advisable with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions and to supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Laws. The Parties shall determine the jurisdictions in which
filings will be made under the Antitrust Laws within ten Business Days of the
date of this Agreement. Each Party agrees to, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates to, make as promptly as practicable its respective filings and
notifications, if any, under any other Applicable Law regarding Government
Contracts, Government Bids, trade regulation, security clearances or any
other relevant matters and to supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to such other Applicable
Laws. RMT Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, pay all filing or
notice fees in connection with the foregoing filings and notifications.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings of the Parties
pursuant to _Section 7.06(a)_, and notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, RMT Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to, take any and all steps reasonably necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust
Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other Person
so as to enable the Parties to close the Contemplated Transactions as promptly
as practicable, and in any event prior to the Termination Date, including
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by

 



64  consent decree, hold separate orders or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of its assets, properties or businesses or of the assets,
properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant hereto, and the
entrance into such other arrangements, as are necessary or advisable to avoid
the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order in any Proceeding that otherwise would reasonably be expected to
have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ that the effectiveness of such
sale, divestiture or disposition or entry into such other arrangement may be
made contingent on the consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be construed to require RMT Parent or Merger Sub to (x)
institute any legal proceedings against any Governmental Authority or (y)
undertake any efforts or to take any action if the taking of such efforts or
action is or would reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the
aggregate, in a material and adverse effect on the assets, liabilities,
business, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of (A)
Spinco and the Transferred Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of (B) RMT
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (each of such actions, a "
_Burdensome Condition_ "); and neither LMC, nor Spinco, nor any of their
Subsidiaries shall take any action that has the effect of, or agree with any
Governmental Authority to, any Burdensome Condition without the prior written
consent of RMT Parent. In addition, RMT Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on
the merits any Proceeding by any Person to avoid entry of, or to have vacated
or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that would prevent the Closing prior to the Termination Date. To
assist RMT Parent in complying with its obligations under this _Section
7.06(b)_, LMC shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, enter into agreements
or arrangements on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to RMT Parent to
be entered into by any of them prior to the Closing with respect to any
matters contemplated by this _Section 7.06(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) nothing in this _Section 7.06(b)_ or in any of the Transaction Documents
shall require LMC or any of its Affiliates to agree to any sale, divestiture,
disposition or other arrangement with respect to any businesses or assets
other than the Spinco Business, (ii) the effectiveness of any sale,
divestiture or disposition or entry into such other arrangements shall be
contingent on the consummation of the Merger and (iii) RMT Parent shall
indemnify LMC and its Affiliates for their reasonable and documented out of
pocket costs and expenses in providing such assistance. 

(c) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of any communication it
or any of its Representatives receives from any Governmental Authority
relating to the ability to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and permit
the other Parties to review in advance any proposed communication by such
Party to any Governmental Authority. The Party providing communications for
review under the foregoing sentence shall consider, in good faith, the
suggestions made by the other Parties. None of the Parties shall agree to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation (including any settlement of an investigation),
litigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other Parties in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting. Each
Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, coordinate and cooperate
fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such
assistance as the other Parties may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods,
including under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law. Each Party shall, and
shall cause its

 



65  Representatives to, provide each other with copies of all correspondence,
filings or communications between them or any of their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members
of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Spinco
Business; (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or
Applicable Law; and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client
or other privilege or confidentiality concerns; _provided_ , _further_ , that
a Party may designate information that it views to be commercially sensitive
or competitively sensitive to be viewed only by outside antitrust counsel for
the other Parties, and such designation shall be honored by the Parties
receiving that information. This _Section 7.06(c)_ shall not apply with
respect to the Internal Reorganization.

(d) Each Party agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not
to, enter into any transaction, or any agreement to effect any transaction
(including any merger, acquisition or other business combination) that could
reasonably be expected to make it more difficult, or to increase the time
required, to (i) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, or under any other Applicable
Law, in respect of the Contemplated Transactions, (ii) avoid the entry of,
the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order
that could reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions or (iii) obtain all
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities
necessary or reasonably mutually determined as advisable for the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions.

 

Section 7.07 _Release from Financial Support Arrangements_.

 

LMC, Spinco, and RMT Parent shall (and RMT Parent shall cause its Affiliates
to) (RMT Parent and its Affiliates, collectively, the " _RMT Parent Group_
"), cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to obtain, in the case of each
Financial Support Arrangement set forth on _Section 7.07_ of the LMC
Disclosure Letter, either (a) the unconditional release of each Retained LMC
Entity from the Financial Support Arrangements identified in _Section 7.07_
of the LMC Disclosure Letter from and after the Closing Date, or (b)
substitute guarantees or other credit support so that a member of the
RMT Parent Group is substituted in place of the Retained LMC Entity that is
party to such Financial Support Arrangements, such that LMC or such Retained
LMC Entity may terminate such Financial Support Arrangement upon notice,
without further obligation to the LMC or such Retained LMC Entity (each of
(a) or (b), a " _Financial Support Arrangement Release_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such release or substitution must be effected pursuant to
documentation reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to LMC and RMT
Parent. From and after the Merger Effective Time, RMT Parent shall not permit
any member of the RMT Parent Group to (i) renew or extend the term of or (ii)
increase its obligations under, or (iii) transfer to a third party, any loan,
contract or other obligation for which a Retained LMC Entity is or would
reasonably be expected to be liable under any Financial Support Arrangement.
In the event the parties have not, as of the Closing, obtained a Financial
Support Arrangement Release with respect to any Financial Support Arrangement,
RMT Parent shall, and shall cause a member of the RMT Parent Group to, (x) if
requested by LMC, perform such obligations on behalf of such Retained LMC
Entity; or (y) otherwise take such action as reasonably requested by LMC so as
to put LMC or the applicable Retained LMC Entity in

 



66  materially the same position as if RMT Parent, or such member of the RMT
Parent Group, and not such Retained LMC Entity, had performed or was
performing such obligations. All third party costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the release or substitution of such Financial Support
Arrangements shall be borne by RMT Parent. From and after the Closing, RMT
Parent shall indemnify LMC and its Subsidiaries fully in respect of any and
all Damages incurred by such Person to the extent arising from any Financial
Support Arrangements from and after the Closing.

 

Section 7.08 _Financing_.

 

(a) RMT Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to (i) cause the conditions and comply with the obligations that are
set forth in the RMT Commitment Letter applicable to, and within the control
of or that require the cooperation of, RMT Parent to be fulfilled (or waived,
if deemed advisable by RMT Parent) in a timely fashion in accordance with its
terms, (ii) maintain the RMT Commitment Letter in effect until the initial
funding of the RMT Financing, (iii) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect thereto, on the terms and conditions contained therein (including
the "market flex" provisions) or on such other terms that would not be
prohibited by _clauses (i)_ through _(iv)_ of _Section 7.08(d)_ (the " _RMT
Financing Agreements_ "), and (iv) if all conditions precedent under the RMT
Commitment Letter have been satisfied, on the Closing Date, RMT Parent shall
cause the RMT Lenders to fund the RMT Financing and RMT Inc. to pay the RMT
Parent Special Dividend if all conditions to Closing contained in _Sections
8.01_ and _8.03_ are satisfied or waived (by the applicable party that is the
beneficiary of such condition). In the event any funds in the amounts set
forth in the RMT Commitment Letter or the RMT Financing Agreements, or any
portion thereof, become unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the RMT Commitment Letter or the RMT Financing Agreements, RMT Parent
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts, subject
to  _Section 7.08(d)_, to obtain promptly any such portion from alternative
sources, including on terms materially no less favorable, in the aggregate, to
RMT Parent than those set forth in the RMT Commitment Letter (in each case as
determined in the reasonable discretion of RMT Parent), in an amount
sufficient, when added to the portion of the RMT Financing that is available,
to finance the RMT Parent Special Dividend (the " _RMT Alternative Financing_
") and provide promptly to LMC a copy of any new financing commitment letter
and any associated fee letters (the " _Alternative RMT Commitment Letter_ ");
_provided_ that the terms of any such RMT Alternative Financing must be
consistent with the Tax-Free Status, as reasonably determined by LMC. In the
event any RMT Alternative Financing is obtained, any reference in this
Agreement to "RMT Financing" shall include "RMT Alternative Financing," any
reference to "RMT Commitment Letter" shall include the "Alternative RMT
Commitment Letter," any reference to "RMT Lenders" shall include the financial
institutions providing such RMT Alternative Financing, and any reference to
"RMT Financing Agreements" shall include any definitive agreements with
respect to the Alternative RMT Commitment Letter, and all obligations of RMT
Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.08_ shall be applicable thereto to the
same extent as RMT Parents obligations with respect to the RMT Financing.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the RMT Financing is available and all
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ have been satisfied or
waived or will be satisfied or waived at the Closing, RMT Parent shall take
all actions within its control necessary to allow RMT Inc. to incur the
indebtedness provided under the RMT Financing to consummate the RMT Parent
Special Dividend.

 



67 (b) LMC shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts
(i) cause the conditions and comply with the obligations that are set forth
in the Spinco Commitment Letter applicable to, and within the control of or
that require the cooperation of, LMC to be fulfilled (or waived, if deemed
advisable by LMC) in a timely fashion in accordance with its terms, (ii)
maintain the Spinco Commitment Letter in effect until the initial funding of
the Spinco Financing, (iii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect
thereto, on the terms and conditions contained therein (including the "market
flex" provisions) or on such other terms that would not be prohibited by
_Section 7.08(e)_ (the " _Spinco Financing Agreements_ " and, together with
the RMT Financing Agreements, the " _Financing Agreements_ "), and (iv) if
all conditions precedent under the Spinco Commitment Letter have been
satisfied, LMC shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, cause the Spinco
Lenders to fund the Spinco Financing prior to or substantially
contemporaneously with the Distribution and pay the Spinco Special Cash
Payment if all conditions to Closing contained in Section 8.01 and Section
8.02 are, or, on the Closing Date can be reasonably be expected to
be, satisfied or waived (by the applicable party that is the beneficiary of
such condition). In the event any funds in the amounts set forth in the Spinco
Commitment Letter or the Spinco Financing Agreements, or any portion thereof,
become unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Spinco
Commitment Letter or the Spinco Financing Agreements, LMC shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, in consultation with RMT Parent, use reasonable best
efforts to obtain promptly any such portion from alternative sources, on
terms acceptable to RMT Parent, in an amount sufficient, when added to the
portion of the Spinco Financing that is available, to finance the Spinco
Special Cash Payment (the " _Spinco Alternative Financing_ " and, together
with any RMT Alternative Financing, the " _Alternative Financings_ " and each,
an " _Alternative Financing_ ") and provide promptly to RMT Parent a copy of
any new financing commitment letter and any associated fee letters (the "
_Alternative Spinco Commitment Letter_ "); _provided_ that the terms of any
such Spinco Alternative Financing must be consistent with the Tax-Free Status,
as reasonably determined by LMC. In the event Spinco Alternative Financing is
obtained, any reference in this Agreement to "Spinco Financing" shall include
"Spinco Alternative Financing," any reference to "Spinco Commitment Letter"
shall include the "Alternative Spinco Commitment Letter," any reference to
"Spinco Lenders" shall include the financial institutions providing such
Alternative Financing, and any reference to "Spinco Financing Agreements"
shall include any definitive agreements with respect to the Alternative
Spinco Commitment Letter, and all obligations of LMC pursuant to this Section
7.08 shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as LMCs obligations with
respect to the Spinco Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Spinco
Financing is available and all conditions to the Closing set forth in Article
VIII have been satisfied or waived or will be satisfied or waived at the
Closing, Spinco shall, and LMC shall cause Spinco to, take all actions within
its control necessary to cause Spinco to incur the indebtedness provided under
the Spinco Commitment Letter to make the Spinco Special Cash Payment.

 

(c) RMT Parent and LMC shall each give the other prompt written notice (v) of
any material breach (or threatened material breach) or default (or any event
or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default) by any
party to the Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements, (w) of the
receipt of any written notice of any actual or threatened withdrawal,
repudiation or termination of either Financing by any of the Lenders, (x) of
the receipt of any written notice of any material dispute or disagreement
between or among any of the parties to the Commitment Letters or the
Financing Agreements, (y) of any amendment or modification of, or

 



68  waiver under, the Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements or (z) if
for any reason either believes in good faith that it or its Affiliates will
not be able to timely obtain all or any portion of the RMT Financing or
Spinco Financing, as applicable, on the terms and in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the RMT Commitment Letter or the Spinco Commitment
Letter, as applicable, or the RMT Financing Agreements or the Spinco
Financing Agreements, as applicable. RMT Parent and LMC shall keep one another
informed upon reasonable request and in reasonable detail of the status of
their efforts to arrange the RMT Financing and the Spinco Financing, as
applicable.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, RMT Parent may
amend, modify, replace, waive or change any provision in the RMT Commitment
Letter or any of the RMT Financing Agreements; _provided_ that any such
amendment, modification, replacement, waiver or change must be consistent with
the Tax-Free Status, as reasonably determined by LMC; _provided_ ,  _further_
that RMT Parent shall not permit or agree to any such amendment, modification,
replacement, waiver or change to be made to the RMT Commitment Letter or any
of the RMT Financing Agreements without obtaining the prior written consent
of LMC, that would (i) change, amend, expand or modify the conditions
precedent set forth therein, or impose new or additional conditions, in each
case in any manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the RMT Financing, (ii) reduce the aggregate cash
amount of the RMT Financing such that the aggregate funds that would be
available to RMT Parent upon the closing of the RMT Financing would not be
sufficient to fund the RMT Parent Special Dividend, (iii) decrease the
aggregate cash amount of the RMT Financing as set forth in the RMT Commitment
Letter such that such aggregate amount is less than the aggregate cash amount
to be funded upon the closing thereof as set forth in the RMT Commitment
Letter as of the date hereof, or (iv) amend or modify any other term or
provision in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the ability of RMT Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or adversely
impact the ability of RMT Parent to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the RMT Commitment Letter or any of the RMT Financing Agreements.
Notwithstanding anything herein, RMT Parent may modify, supplement or amend
the RMT Commitment Letter or any of the RMT Financing Agreements, (x) to add
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have
not executed the RMT Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and (y) to
implement or exercise any market flex provisions provided in, the RMT
Commitment Letter as in effect as of the date hereof. In such event, the term
"RMT Commitment Letter" as used herein shall be deemed to include the new or
amended commitment letters entered into in accordance with this _Section
7.08(d)_, and the term "RMT Financing" as used herein shall be deemed to
include any substitute financing obtained in accordance with this _Section
7.08(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any portion of the RMT
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
RMT Commitment Letter, the second sentence of  _Section 7.08(a)_, and not
this _Section 7.08(d)_, shall govern with respect to the terms of any
replacement financing to be obtained after any portion of the RMT Financing
becomes unavailable as described therein.

 

(e) Neither Spinco nor LMC shall, nor shall they permit or cause their
respective Affiliates to, amend, modify, supplement, replace, waive or change
any provision in the Spinco Commitment Letter or any of the Spinco Financing
Agreements without the prior written consent of RMT Parent; _provided_ that
LMC or its Affiliates may modify, supplement or 

 



69  amend the Spinco Commitment Letter or any of the Spinco Financing Agreements
to implement any market flex exercised by the Spinco Lenders in accordance
with the Spinco Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. If RMT Parent so
consents or such market flex is exercised, the term "Spinco Commitment Letter"
as used herein shall be deemed to include the new commitment letters (or
ancillary documents) entered into in accordance with this  _Section
7.08(e)_, if applicable, or amendments to the existing Spinco Commitment
Letter and the term "Spinco Financing" as used herein shall be deemed to
include any substitute financing obtained in accordance with this  _Section
7.08(e)_, if applicable, or amendments to the existing Spinco Commitment
Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any portion of the Spinco
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Spinco Commitment Letter, the second sentence of _Section 7.08(b)_, and not
this _Section 7.08(e)_, shall govern with respect to the terms of any
replacement financing to be obtained after any portion of the
Spinco Financing becomes unavailable as described therein.

(f) Prior to the closing of the Financings, LMC shall provide or shall cause
its Affiliates to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives (and use reasonable best efforts to cause external
auditors) to provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Financings, as may be reasonably requested by RMT Parent,
and that is customary in connection with efforts to obtain financing of the

71   _provided_ , _however_ , that RMT Parent shall not be responsible for
reimbursing any such costs and expenses if such costs and expenses would have

respective obligations pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement
(including _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.16_) and the Separation Agreement;

such information with potential financing sources in connection with any
marketing efforts in connection with the Financings; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the recipients of such information and any other information

in support of the LMC Merger Tax Opinion and the RMT Parent Merger Tax

delivering the Tax Representation Letters in accordance with the terms of
_Section 7.09(c)_ or (ii) obtaining the opinions contemplated by _Section
8.03(b)_.

(e) As of the date hereof, RMT Parent has not taken or agreed to take any

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, LMC shall provide RMT Parent with
(i) the audited combined and consolidated financial statements of the Spinco
Business (before giving effect to the Internal Reorganization and the Spinco
Transfer), including the combined and consolidated balance sheets of (x) the
Spinco Business and (y) Spinco (before giving effect to the Internal
Reorganization) as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, and the
combined and consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows and parent equity
of (x) the Spinco Business and (y) Spinco (before giving effect to
the Internal Reorganization) for the years ended December 31, 2013, December
31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 together with a report on the financial
statements from the independent accounts for the Spinco Business
(collectively, the " _Spinco Audited Financial Statements_ ") and (ii) the
unaudited combined and consolidated financial statements of (x) the Spinco
Business and (y) Spinco (before giving effect to the Internal Reorganization
and the Spinco Transfer) for applicable interim periods ending prior to the
date of this Agreement required for SEC filings, prepared from the books and
records of LMC and its Subsidiaries and in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the requirements
of Regulation S-X, which present fairly in all material respects the combined
financial position and combined results of operations of (x) the Spinco
Business and (y) Spinco (before giving effect to the Internal Reorganization
and the Spinco Transfer) as of the dates and for the periods shown therein
(except as otherwise noted therein) (it being understood, however, that the
Spinco Business has not been operating historically as a separate
"standalone" entity or reporting segment and, therefore, the Spinco Audited
Financial Statements and the unaudited Interim Financial Statements of the
Spinco Business will reflect certain adjustments necessary to be presented on
a stand-alone basis in accordance with GAAP and SEC requirements). LMC will
use reasonable best efforts to procure, at its expense, the delivery of the
consents of its independent accountants required to be filed with the Form S-4
Registration Statement or any future registration statement until such
independent accountant consents are no longer required.

(b) LMC shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable,
and no later than 50 calendar days after the end of any fiscal quarter (or, in
the case of the first fiscal quarter ended in 2016, 55 calendar days) and 60
calendar days after the end of the 2016 fiscal year, prepare and furnish to
RMT Parent copies of financial statements of the Spinco Business as of and for
the periods ending on any fiscal quarterly and annual periods ending after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, in each case together
with the notes thereto, and prepared from the books and records of LMC and its
Subsidiaries and in accordance with GAAP with no exception or qualification
thereto (it being understood, however, that the Spinco Business has not been
operating historically as a separate "standalone" entity or reporting

 



77  segment and, therefore, the financial statements of the Spinco Business will
reflect certain adjustments necessary to be presented on a stand-alone basis
in accordance with GAAP and SEC requirements) applied on a consistent basis
through the periods involved (except as may otherwise be required under GAAP)
and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the requirements of
Regulation S-X, and, in the case of the combined financial statements of the
Spinco Business for any fiscal year, LMC shall use its reasonable best efforts
to ensure that such financial statements shall be audited and accompanied by a
report of the independent accountants for the Spinco Business and for any
quarterly period, LMC shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
such financial statements shall be reviewed by the independent accountants for
the Spinco Business. When delivered, such financial statements shall present
fairly in all material respects the combined financial position and combined
and consolidated results of operations of the Spinco Business as of the dates
and for the periods shown therein. LMC acknowledges that RMT Parents
obligations under  _Section 7.01_ depend, in part, on LMCs compliance with
this _Section 7.16_, and therefore RMT Parent shall be afforded a reasonable
period to comply with such obligations based upon the timing of LMC providing
the financial statements contemplated in this _Section 7.16_.

(c) In connection with the filing of the RMT Parent Registration Statement
and other SEC filings, LMC shall use its reasonable efforts during the pre-
Closing period and after the Closing to (i) cooperate with RMT Parent to
prepare pro forma financial statements that comply with the rules and
regulations of the SEC to the extent required for SEC filings, including the
requirements of Regulation S-X and (ii) provide and make reasonably available
upon reasonable notice the senior management employees of LMC to discuss the
materials prepared and delivered pursuant to this _Section 7.16_. RMT Parent
shall, promptly upon request by the LMC, reimburse LMC for all documented and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by LMC or its Subsidiaries for actions
taken at the request of RMT Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.16(c)_
following the Closing.

Section 7.17 _Corrective Changes_.

 

Prior to the Closing Date, LMC shall cause the Spinco Companies to use
reasonable efforts to effect any necessary corrective change of ownership
filings and records with all patent, trademark, and copyright offices and
domain name registrars and other similar authorities (" _Corrective Changes_
") as may be necessary to correct any break or discrepancy in the chain
of title for any registered Transferred Intellectual Property (i.e., to
properly reflect an LMC Entity as the record owner thereof). From and after
the Closing, RMT Parent shall be responsible for recording, and upon RMT
Parents reasonable request, LMC shall cooperate with the Spinco Companies to
record, the assignment of the Transferred Intellectual Property to the
applicable Spinco Company (i.e., to properly reflect such Spinco Company as
the record owner thereof) (the " _Spinco Assignment Recordations_ ") and to
otherwise effect any Corrective Change not made by LMC or the Spinco Companies
prior to the Closing.

 

Section 7.18 _Spinco Authorized Shares_.

 

Prior to the Distribution, LMC and Spinco shall take all such actions
necessary to amend and restate Spincos organizational documents, in form
reasonably acceptable to RMT Parent, such that the authorized number of Spinco
shares shall exceed the number of Spinco shares contemplated by _Section
2.04(d)_ of this Agreement and Section 3.03 of the Separation Agreement.

remedy of such party, its Subsidiaries, shareholders, Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees and Representatives against the other party or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates or any Lender or Lender Related Party for, and
in no event will the party being paid any Termination Fee or any other such

on a claim in law or equity with respect to: (1) any loss suffered, directly
or indirectly, as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated,
(2) the termination of this Agreement, (3) any liabilities or obligations
arising under this Agreement, or (4) any claims or actions arising out of or
relating to any breach, termination or failure of or under this Agreement,

Section 10.03 _Amendments; Waivers_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of _Article IX_ , any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver
is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by all of the Parties,
or in the case of a waiver, by the Party or Parties against whom the waiver is
to be effective; _provided_ that any amendment or waiver of  _Section
9.03(d)_, this _Section 10.03(a)_, _Section 10.03(b)_, _Section 10.04_,
_Section 10.10_, _Section 10.11_, _Section 10.16_, _Section 10.17_ or 
_Section 10.18_ or to any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment or waiver of such provision would modify the substance of any of the
foregoing enumerated provisions, in each case that adversely affects any
RMT Lender, Spinco Lender or any of their respective Lender Related Parties
shall not be effective with respect to such affected Lender or Lender Related
Party unless such Lender or Lender Related Party consented to such amendment
or waiver in writing. 

(b) No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as
otherwise provided herein, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement,
including any investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. Any term, covenant or condition of this Agreement

 



87  may be waived at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit
thereof, but only by a written notice signed by such Party expressly waiving
such term, covenant or condition;  _provided_ that any waiver of _Section
9.03(d)_, _Section 10.03(a)_, this _Section 10.03(b)_, _Section 10.04_,
_Section 10.10_, _Section 10.11_, _Section 10.16_,  _Section 10.17_ or
_Section 10.18_ or to any other provision of this Agreement to the extent a
waiver of such provision would modify the substance of any of the foregoing
enumerated provisions, in each case that adversely affects any RMT Lender,
Spinco Lender or any of their respective Lender Related Parties shall not be
effective with respect to such affected Lender or Lender Related Party unless
such Lender or Lender Related Party has consented to such waiver in
writing. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision hereunder shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of
the same or any other provision hereunder.

 

Section 10.04 _Successors and Assigns_.

 

The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
No Party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer, directly or indirectly,
in whole or in part, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of LMC and RMT Parent; _provided_ that RMT
Parent or LMC may collaterally assign its rights (but not its obligations)
under this Agreement to any of the Lenders or any Lender Related Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no assignment, delegation or other transfer of
rights under this Agreement shall relieve the assignor of any liability or
obligation hereunder. Any attempted assignment, delegation or transfer in
violation of this _Section 10.04_ shall be void.

 

Section 10.05 _Construction_.

 

As used in this Agreement, any reference to the masculine, feminine or neuter
gender shall include all genders, the plural shall include the singular, and
the singular shall include the plural. References in this Agreement to a Party
or other Person include their respective successors and assigns. The words
"include," "includes" and "including" when used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation" unless such phrase
otherwise appears. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this
Agreement to Articles, Sections, Exhibits, Schedules, Disclosure Letters and
Attachments shall be deemed references to Articles and Sections of, and
Exhibits, Schedules, Disclosure Letters and Attachments to, this Agreement.
Unless the context otherwise requires, the words "hereof," "hereby" and
"herein" and words of similar meaning when used in this Agreement refer to
this Agreement in its entirety and not to any particular Article, Section or
provision hereof. Except when used together with the word "either" or
otherwise for the purpose of identifying mutually exclusive alternatives, the
term "or" has the inclusive meaning represented by the phrase "and/or". With
regard to each and every term and condition of this Agreement, the Parties
understand and agree that, if at any time the Parties desire or are required
to interpret or construe any such term or condition or any agreement or
instrument subject thereto, no consideration shall be given to the issue
of which Party actually prepared, drafted or requested any term or condition
of this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to "dollars" or "$" shall
mean United States dollars. Any period of time hereunder ending on a day
that is not a Business Day shall be extended to the next Business Day. Where
used with respect to information, the phrases "delivered" or "made available"
shall mean that the information referred to is publicly available 

 



88  on the SECs website through its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and
Retrieval (EDGAR) system or has been physically or electronically delivered to
the relevant Parties or their respective Representatives, including, in the
case of "made available" to RMT Parent, material that has been posted in a
"data room" (virtual or otherwise) established by or on behalf of LMC or
Spinco; including further, in the case of "made available" to LMC or Spinco,
material that has been posted in a "data room" (virtual or otherwise)
established by or on behalf of RMT Parent or Merger Sub.

 

Section 10.06 _Disclosure Letters_.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Disclosure Letters,
in this Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents, the information and
disclosures contained in any Section of a Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to
be disclosed and incorporated by reference in each other Section of such
Disclosure Letter as though fully set forth in such other Section to the
extent the relevance of such information to such other Section is reasonably
apparent on its face notwithstanding the omission of a reference or a cross-
reference with respect thereto and notwithstanding any reference to a Section
of such Disclosure Letter in this Agreement. Certain items and matters are
listed in the Disclosure Letters for informational purposes only and may not
be required to be listed therein by the terms of this Agreement. In no event
shall the listing of items or matters in a Disclosure Letter be deemed or
interpreted to broaden, or otherwise expand the scope of, the representations
and warranties or covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement. No
reference to, or disclosure of, any item or matter in any Section of this
Agreement or any Section of a Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an
admission or indication that such item or matter is material or that such item
or matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in this Agreement or in
such Disclosure Letter. Without limiting the foregoing, no reference to, or
disclosure of, a possible breach or violation of any contract or agreement,
Applicable Law or Governmental Order shall be construed as an admission or
indication that a breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

Section 10.07 _Public Announcements_.

 

None of the Parties shall make, or cause to be made, any press release or
public announcement in respect of this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or otherwise
communicate with any news media regarding this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, unless such press
release or public announcement is required by Applicable Law or applicable
stock exchange regulation, in which case the Parties shall, to the extent
practicable, consult with each other as to the timing and contents of any
such press release, public announcement or communication; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the prior written consent of the other Parties shall not be
required hereunder with respect to any press release, public announcement or
communication that is substantially similar to a press release, public
announcement or communication previously issued with the prior written consent
of the other Parties.

 



89 Section 10.08 _Entire Agreement_.

 

This Agreement (including the Disclosure Letters), the other Transaction
Documents and any other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby, constitute
the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings and negotiations,
both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof. 

Section 10.09 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_.

 

This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts (including by
facsimile or PDF), each of which shall be an original, with the same effect
as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become effective when each Party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other Party hereto.

 

Section 10.10 _Governing Law_.

 

This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by federal
law and by the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to the choice of
law provisions thereof); except that, notwithstanding the foregoing, all
matters relating to interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort, by statute or otherwise)
against any of the Lenders or Lender Related Parties in any way relating to
the Financing, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the domestic Law of the State of New York without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule whether of the State of New York
or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of Law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 

Section 10.11 _Dispute Resolution, Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions shall be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), and each of the
Parties hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court (and of
the appropriate appellate courts) in any such Proceeding and waives any
objection to venue laid therein. Process in any such Proceeding may be served
on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the State of
Delaware. Without limiting the foregoing, RMT Parent, LMC and Spinco agree
that service of process upon such Party at the address referred to in
_Section 10.02_ (or such other address as may be specified in accordance with
_Section 10.02_ shall be deemed effective service of process upon such
Party). EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING (INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING ANY LITIGATION AGAINST ANY LENDER OR
LENDER RELATED PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO

 



90  THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SPINCO COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF,
IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS  _SECTION 10.11_.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 10.11(a)_ to the contrary, and
without limiting anything set forth in _Section 10.18_, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any suit, action or other
proceeding (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
against any Lender or Lender Related Party in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing or, if
applicable, any Alternative Financing, or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than any New York State court or federal court sitting in the
County of New York and the Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts
thereof). The parties hereto further agree that all of the provisions of the
preceding _clause (a)_ relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to any
suit, action or other proceeding referenced in this _clause (b)._

 

Section 10.12 _Severability_.

 

Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. The application of
such invalid or unenforceable provision to Persons or circumstances other
than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall be valid and
be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. To the extent
any provision of this Agreement is determined to be prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or determined to be impermissible by any
Governmental Authority, RMT Parent, LMC and Spinco agree to use reasonable
commercial efforts to substitute one or more valid, legal and enforceable
provisions that, insofar as practicable, implement the purposes and intent of
the prohibited, unenforceable, or impermissible provision.

 

Section 10.13 _Captions_.

 

The captions herein are included for convenience of reference only and shall
be ignored in the construction or interpretation hereof.

 

Section 10.14 _Specific Performance_.

 

Each Party acknowledges that money damages would be both incalculable and an
insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by such Party and that
any such breach would cause the other Parties irreparable harm. Accordingly,
each Party also agrees that, in the

 



91  event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement
by such Party, the other Parties shall be entitled to equitable relief without
the requirement of posting a bond or other security, including in the form of
injunctions and orders for specific performance, in addition to all other
remedies available to such other Parties at law or in equity. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Parties agree that each Party shall be
entitled to enforce specifically the other Parties obligations to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the obligation to
consummate the Closing and the RMT Parent Share Issuance and the obligations
with respect to the Financing), if the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing) or waived (where permissible under
Applicable Law). The Parties agree that they will not contest the
appropriateness of specific performance as a remedy.

Section 10.15  _Payments_.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, all payments by a Party to another Party under this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account in the United States designated by
the recipient when due. Any amount remaining unpaid beyond its due date,
including disputed amounts that are ultimately determined to be payable, shall
bear interest at the Interest Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, in no event shall the
amount or rate of interest due and payable exceed the maximum amount or rate
of interest allowed by Applicable Law.

(b) Any payment made to LMC from Spinco or to Spinco from LMC will be treated
as provided under Section 13(b) of the Tax Matters Agreement.

Section 10.16 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, only the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to, or
shall confer upon, any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified period,
under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (a) _Section 7.05_ (which
is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be
enforced by such Persons), (b) _Section 10.17_ (which is intended to be for
the benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such
Persons) and (c) the Lenders and the Lender Related Parties shall be third-
party beneficiaries of  _Section 9.03(d)_, _Section 10.03(a)_, _Section
10.03(b)_, _Section 10.04_, _Section 10.10_, _Section 10.11_, this _Section
10.16_, _Section 10.17_ and  _Section 10.18_.

Section 10.17 _Non-Parties_.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is hereby
