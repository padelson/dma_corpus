Agreement (except as it relates to any Taxes), shall be interpreted in
accordance with GAAP and Council of Petroleum Accountants Society ("COPAS")
standards, as applicable. "Property Costs" means all operating costs and

delivered to the job site, or the date on which the work ordered is performed,
shall be the relevant date. For purposes of allocating Hydrocarbon production
(and accounts receivable with respect thereto), under this Section 1.4, (i)
liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the
Properties when they are placed into the storage facilities and (ii) gaseous
Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Properties
when they pass through the delivery point sales meters on the pipelines
through which they are transported. Seller shall utilize reasonable
interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation of Hydrocarbon production
when exact meter readings or gauging and strapping data is not available.
Seller shall provide to Purchaser, no later than five (5) Business Days prior

purposes of establishing the adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.2 hereof that will be used to determine the Closing Payment.

Closing. Other than any original Records retained by Seller pursuant to
Section 1.2(m), Purchaser shall be entitled to all original Records maintained

provided, however, that Seller shall not sell or otherwise allow third parties
to review, copy or otherwise use any Records retained by Seller except as
required by law or permitted in connection with a transfer pursuant to Section
12.10. Purchaser shall preserve (or shall cause its successor in interest
with respect to the Assets to preserve) the Records for a period of seven (7)
years following the Closing and will allow (or shall cause its successor in
interest with respect to the Assets to allow) Seller and its representatives,

Seller, including in order for Seller to comply with a Tax or other legally
required reporting obligation or Tax or legal dispute. Any

(a)Reduced by the aggregate amount of the following proceeds received by
Seller and attributable to the period of time after (and including) the
Effective Time (with the period after (and including) the Effective Time
referred to as the "Adjustment Period"): (i) proceeds from the sale of

for the avoidance of doubt, any Asset Taxes, Income Taxes and Transfer Taxes)
attributable to the

  ownership and operation of the Assets which are paid or otherwise economically
borne by Seller and Incurred during (or attributable to) the Adjustment Period
(including any overhead costs under Schedule 1.4 deemed charged to the Assets
with respect to the Adjustment Period even though not actually paid), except
any Property Costs and such other costs already deducted in the determination
of proceeds in Section 2.2(a); 

 

(e)Reduced to the extent provided in Section 3.4(c)(iii) for any Properties
excluded from the Assets pursuant to Section 3.4(c)(iii) and reduced to the

that belong to Seller as of the Effective Time (which value shall be computed
at the applicable third-party contract prices for sales during the month of
October, 2017 for such stored Hydrocarbons);

 

(h)Reduced or increased, as the case may be, by the actual net aggregate
Imbalances, if any, owed by Seller to third parties, or third parties to
Seller, as of the Effective Time, multiplied by a price of $3.00 per MMBtu;

amount of costs and expenses paid by Seller on behalf of or that are properly
chargeable to any third party with respect to any Asset or relating to
Seller's operation of any Asset, including the Carried Drilling Accounts
Receivable;

 

(k)[Reserved];

 

(l)Reduced by an amount equal to all proceeds from sales of Hydrocarbons
relating to the Assets and payable to owners of working interests, royalties
or other similar interests (in each case) that are held by Seller in suspense

accordance with Section 7.8(a) but paid or otherwise economically borne by
Seller; and

 

(n)Reduced by the amount of all Asset Taxes allocated to Seller in accordance
with Section 7.8(a) but paid or otherwise economically borne by Purchaser.

 

Each adjustment made pursuant to Section 2.2(a) shall serve to satisfy, up to
the amount of the adjustment, Purchaser's entitlement under Section 1.4 to
Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the Properties during the
Adjustment Period, and to the value of other income, proceeds, receipts and
credits earned with respect to the Assets during the Adjustment Period, and as
such, Purchaser shall not have any separate rights to receive any Hydrocarbon
production

serve to satisfy, up to the amount of the adjustment, Purchaser's obligation
under Section 1.4 to pay Property Costs and other costs (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Asset Taxes, Income Taxes and Transfer Taxes)
attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets which are Incurred

With respect to the Target Depth in the Warranty Wells shown in Exhibit A-1,
entitles Seller to receive a share of the Hydrocarbons produced, saved and
marketed from the Target Depth in each of the Warranty Wells shown in Exhibit
A-1 throughout the duration of the productive life of such Target Depth in
such Warranty Well (after satisfaction of all royalties, overriding royalties,
net profits interests or other similar burdens on or measured by production of
Hydrocarbons) (a "Net Revenue Interest"), of not less than the Net Revenue
Interest shown in Exhibit A-1 for such Target Depth in such Warranty Well,
except (solely to the extent that such actions do not cause a breach of
Seller's covenants under Section 7.6) for decreases in connection with those
operations in which Seller may from and after the Execution Date become a non-
consenting co-owner, decreases resulting from the establishment or amendment
from and after the Execution Date of pools or units, and decreases required to

results in another Person's superior claim of title; 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(iv)

 |  

defects based on a gap in Seller's chain of title in the county records as to
fee Leases, unless such gap is affirmatively shown to exist in such records by

following:

 

(a)Royalties and any overriding royalties, reversionary interests, net profit
interests, production payments, carried interests, and other burdens, to the

  Section 3.4Notice of Title Defect Adjustments

 

.

 

(a)To assert a claim of a Title Defect prior to Closing, Purchaser must
deliver claim notices to Seller (each a "Title Defect Notice") on or before
February 23, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Central Time (the "Title Claim Date");
provided, however, that Purchaser agrees that it shall furnish Seller once
every two weeks until the Title Claim Date with a Title Defect Notice if any
officer of Purchaser or its Affiliates discover or learn of any Title Defect
during such two-week period; further provided that, the failure of Purchaser
to furnish such notice shall not in any respect affect Purchaser's rights
under this Agreement nor limit its ability to assert Title Defects under this
Agreement. Each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i)
a description of the alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) the Warranty Wells affected
by the Title Defect (each a "Title Defect Property"), (iii) the Allocated
Value of each Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documents reasonably
necessary for Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by
Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s), and (v) the
amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each
Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the
computations and information upon which Purchaser's belief is based.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, WITHOUT
PREJUDICE TO ITS RIGHTS IN THE CONVEYANCE AND IN SECTION 11.5(A) WITH RESPECT
TO A BREACH OF SECTION 5.7, SECTION 5.9, SECTION 5.10, SECTION 5.11, SECTION
5.12, SECTION 5.13, SECTION 5.14, SECTION 5.16, SECTION 5.17, SECTION 5.19,
SECTION 5.25, SECTION 5.26, SECTION 5.27 AND SECTION 5.28, PURCHASER SHALL BE
DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED ITS RIGHT TO ASSERT TITLE DEFECTS OF WHICH SELLER HAS
NOT BEEN GIVEN NOTICE ON OR BEFORE THE TITLE CLAIM DATE. For purposes hereof,
the "Allocated Value" of an Asset shall mean the portion of the Purchase Price
that has been allocated to a particular Warranty Well in Exhibit A-1 as
prepared by Purchaser and reviewed for reasonableness by Seller.

 

(b)Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to
Purchaser on or before the Title Claim Date, with respect to each Title
Benefit, a notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") including (i) a description of
the Title Benefit, (ii) the Warranty Wells affected, (iii) the Allocated
Values of the Warranty Wells subject to such Title Benefit and (iv) the amount
by which Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Value of those Warranty
Wells is increased by the Title Benefit, and the computations and information
upon which Seller's belief is based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived
all Title Benefits of which it has not given notice to Purchaser on or before
the Title Claim Date.

 

(c)Remedies for Title Defects.

 

In the event that any Title Defect is not waived by Purchaser or cured on or
before Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall mutually elect to have one of the
following remedies apply:

 

    



 |  

(i)

 |  

subject to the Individual Title Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Deductible,
have the Purchase Price reduced by an amount agreed upon ("Title Defect
Amount") pursuant to Section 3.4(f) or Section 3.4(h) by Purchaser and Seller
as being the value of such Title Defect, taking into consideration the
Allocated Value of the Property subject to such Title Defect, the portion of
the Property subject to such Title Defect and the 

---|---|--- 

 

12

 



      



 |  |  

legal effect of such Title Defect on the Property affected thereby; provided,
however, that the methodology, terms and conditions of Section 3.4(f) shall
control any such determination; 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(ii)

 |  

have Seller retain the entirety of the Property that is subject to such Title
Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which event the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Property;
or 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(iii)

 |  

at Closing, have Purchaser deposit into the Escrow Account the full Allocated
Value of the Property that is subject to such Title Defect to the extent such
amount exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible (the "Defect Escrow Amount").
Seller shall then have 180 days after Closing (the "Cure Period") in which to
cure the Title Defect. Any Property so held back from the initial Closing
will be conveyed to Purchaser at a delayed Closing within ten (10) days
following the date that the Title Defect is cured, at which time Seller shall
be entitled to withdraw the full Defect Escrow Amount from the Escrow Account
and the Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release the Defect Escrow
Amount to Seller, and provided further that if multiple delayed Closings are
contemplated as a result of this provision and/or Section 7.7(c), the delayed
Closings may be consolidated on dates mutually agreeable to the parties. In
the event that Seller is unable to cure the Title Defect within 180 days of
the initial Closing, then Seller shall, at its sole election, select the
remedy set forth in subsection (i) or (ii) above as the remedy for such Title
Defect. Should Seller's choice ultimately lead to application of Section
3.4(h), the Title Expert shall be selected within fifteen (15) Business Days
of the end of this 180 day cure period. All other provisions of Section
3.4(h) shall apply as written. 

---|---|--- 

 

In the event that Purchaser and Seller cannot mutually agree upon one of the
foregoing remedies with respect to a Title Defect asserted by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 3.4(a) prior to Closing, then Seller shall, at its sole
election, select the remedy set forth in subsection (i) or (iii) above shall
be the remedy for such Title Defect, provided that Seller may require the
election of the remedy set forth in subsection (ii) if the Title Defect Amount
affecting a Property is equal to 100% of the Allocated Value of such Property,
and nothing shall preclude Seller from curing a Title Defect on or before the
day that is 180 days after Closing.

 

(d)With respect to the Target Depth in each Warranty Well in Exhibit A-1
affected by Title Benefits reported under Section 3.4(b), the Purchase Price
shall be increased by an amount (the "Title Benefit Amount") equal to the
increase in the Allocated Value for such Warranty Well in Exhibit A-1 caused
by such Title Benefits, as determined pursuant to Section 3.4(g), but any such
increase shall be capped at the total amount of the reduction to the Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 2.2(c) in respect of Title Defects.

 

(e)Section 3.4(c) shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser with
respect to Title Defects asserted by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.4(a).
Section 3.4(c) shall be the

 

13

 



  exclusive right and remedy of Seller with respect to Title Benefits asserted
by Seller pursuant to Section 3.4(b).

 

(f)The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount
by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property is reduced as a
result of the existence of such Title Defect and shall be determined in
accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:

 

    



 |  

(i)

 |  

if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be
the Title Defect Amount; 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(ii)

 |  

if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is undisputed
and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount
necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect
Property; 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(iii)

 |  

if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue
Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated
on Exhibit A-1 and causes a proportionate decrease to Seller's working
interest shown on Exhibit A-1, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated on Exhibit A-1; 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(iv)

 |  

if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge
upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not
described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Defect Amount
shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title
Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the
Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic
effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the
values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller and such other
factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; and 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(v)

 |  

notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any
Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property. 

---|---|--- 

 

(g)The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of the affected Warranty Well multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of
which is the Net Revenue Interest stated on Exhibit A-1.

 

(h)Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to agree on all Title
Defects, Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts prior
to Closing. Unless otherwise provided hereunder, if Seller and Purchaser are
unable to agree by Closing, the Properties subject

 

14

 



  to the dispute shall be included in the Conveyance executed and delivered at
Closing, the aggregate amounts subject to such dispute(s) (taking into account
the limitations in Section 3.4(i)) shall be paid into the Escrow Account at
Closing, and the Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute
shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this Section 3.4(h).
There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at
least ten (10) years' experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in
the regional area in which the Properties are located, as selected by mutual
agreement of Purchaser and Seller within fifteen (15) Business Days after the
end of the Cure Period (the "Title Expert"). If the Parties are unable to
mutually agree upon the Title Expert, the Houston, Texas office of the AAA
shall appoint the Title Expert under such conditions as the AAA in its sole
discretion deems necessary or advisable, except that the Title Expert shall
not have any financial interest in either Party or any of its Affiliates. The
Title Expert's determination shall be made within fifteen (15) Business Days
after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon
both parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title
Expert shall be bound by the rules set forth in Section 3.4(f) and Section
3.4(g) and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title
Expert are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Title
Expert may allow the parties to make written submissions of their positions in
the manner and to the extent the Title Expert deems appropriate, and the Title
Expert may call on the parties to submit such other materials as the Title
Expert deems helpful and appropriate to resolution of the dispute.
Additionally, the Title Expert may consult with and engage disinterested third
parties to advise the arbitrator, including without limitation petroleum
engineers. The Title Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit
Amounts submitted by either party and may not award damages, interest or
penalties to either party with respect to any matter. Seller and Purchaser
shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case.
Each party shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Expert,
including any costs Incurred by the Title Expert that are attributable to such
third party consultation. Within ten (10) days after the Title Expert
delivers written notice to Purchaser and Seller of his award with respect to a
Title Defect Amount or a Title Benefit Amount, the Parties shall execute and
deliver a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent requiring the Escrow Agent to
make the payment described in the award of the Title Expert.

 

(i)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be
any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for
any individual uncured Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount therefor
does not exceed $50,000 ("Individual Title Threshold"); and (ii) in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller for uncured Title Defects unless the aggregate Title Defect
Amounts attributable to all uncured Title Defects, taken together with the
aggregate Environmental Defect Amounts attributable to all uncured
Environmental Defects, exceeds a deductible in an amount equal to 1.5% of the
Purchase Price ("Aggregate Defect Deductible"), after which point adjustments
to the Purchase Price or other remedies shall be made or available to
Purchaser only with respect to uncured Title Defects and uncured Environmental
Defects where the aggregate Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect
Amounts attributable are in excess of such Aggregate Defect Deductible. 

 

Section 3.5Casualty or Condemnation Loss

 

.

 

(a)From and after the Effective Time, but subject to the provisions of Section
3.5(b) and (c) below, Purchaser shall assume all risk of loss with respect to
and any change in the

 

15

 



  condition of the Assets and for production of Hydrocarbons through normal
depletion (including but not limited to the watering out of any Well,
collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any Well) and the depreciation of
personal property due to ordinary wear and tear with respect to the Assets.

 

(b)If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain, and the loss as a result of
such individual casualty or taking, taken together with all other casualty
losses and takings, equals or exceeds $3,000,000, unless this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 10.1, the transactions evidenced by this
Agreement shall nevertheless be consummated and Seller shall elect by written
notice to Purchaser prior to Closing either (i) to cause the Assets affected
by any casualty or taking to be repaired or restored to at least its condition
prior to such casualty, at Seller's sole cost, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date), (ii) to indemnify
Purchaser through a document reasonably acceptable to Seller and Purchaser
against any costs or expenses that Purchaser reasonably incurs to repair the
Assets subject to any casualty or taking (iii) to treat such casualty or
taking as a Title Defect with respect to the affected Property or Properties
under Section 3.4 (provided that the Individual Title Threshold and Aggregate
Defect Deductible shall not apply to any such deemed Title Defect). In each
case, Seller shall retain all rights to insurance and other claims against
third parties with respect to the casualty or taking except to the extent the
parties otherwise agree in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
shall have the right to, in lieu of electing the remedies set forth above and
as the sole remedy with respect to such casualty, pay to Purchaser all sums
actually paid to Seller or its Affiliates by third parties by reason of any
casualty insofar as with respect to the affected Assets and shall assign,
transfer and set over to Purchaser or subrogate Purchaser to all of Seller's

assign to Seller) all right, title, interest and claims against third parties
for the recovery of Seller's costs and expenses incurred prior to Closing in
repairing such casualty and/or pursuing or asserting any such insurance claims
or other rights against third parties (provided that if Seller is unable to
assign, transfer and set over to Purchaser or subrogate Purchaser to any of
Seller's or its Affiliates' right, title and interest (if any) to any such
insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other rights against third parties,
Seller and/or its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
enforce such rights for the benefit of Buyer).

 

(c)If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain, and the loss to the Assets as a
result of such individual casualty or taking, taken together with all other
casualty losses and takings, is less than $3,000,000, the transaction
evidenced by this Agreement shall nevertheless be consummated and Seller
shall, at Closing, pay to Purchaser all sums paid to Seller by third parties
by reason of such casualty or taking and shall assign, transfer and set over
to Purchaser all of Seller's right, title and interest (if any) in insurance
claims, unpaid awards, and other rights against third parties (other than
Affiliates of Seller and its and their directors, officers, employees and
agents) arising out of the casualty or taking.

  Article 4 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

Section 4.1Assessment

 

.

 

Subject to this Section 4.1, from and after the date of execution of this
Agreement until the Environmental Claim Date, Seller shall afford to Purchaser
and its officers, employees, agents and authorized representatives reasonable
access to the Assets, including the Records in accordance with Section 7.1.
Purchaser shall be entitled to conduct a Phase I environmental property
assessment with respect to the Assets. The Phase I and Purchaser's other
diligence activities shall be conducted at the sole cost and expense of
Purchaser, and shall be subject to the indemnity provisions of Section 4.4.
Seller or its designee shall have the right to accompany Purchaser and
Purchaser's representatives whenever they are on site on Assets and also to
collect split test samples if any are collected. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall not have access to, and shall not be
permitted to conduct any environmental due diligence (including any Phase I
environmental property assessments) with respect to any Assets where Seller or
its Affiliates do not have the authority to grant access for such due
diligence (provided, however, Seller and its Affiliates shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission from any other Person to
allow Purchaser and Purchaser's representatives such access and as long as
Seller and its Affiliates have exercised such commercially reasonable efforts,
Seller shall have no liability to Purchaser for failure to obtain any such
other Person's permission). In the event that Purchaser's Phase I
environmental property assessments identify actual or potential non-compliance
with Environmental Laws, then Purchaser may request Seller's consent to
conduct additional Phase II environmental property assessments, which consent
shall be given in Seller's sole discretion. Purchaser shall maintain, and
shall cause its officers, employees, representatives, consultants and advisors
to maintain, all information obtained by Purchaser pursuant to any Phase I or
other due diligence activity as strictly confidential until the Closing
occurs, unless disclosure of any facts discovered through such Phase I is
required under applicable Law. Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of
the final version of all environmental reports prepared by, or on behalf of,
Purchaser with respect to any Phase I or other environmental due diligence
activity conducted on the Properties. In the event that any necessary
disclosures under applicable Laws are required with respect to matters
discovered by any Phase I or other environmental due diligence conducted by,
for or on behalf of Purchaser, Purchaser agrees that Seller shall be the
responsible party for disclosing such matters to the appropriate Governmental
Bodies; provided that, if Seller fails to promptly make such disclosure and
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is legally obligated to make such
disclosure, such Person shall have the right to fully comply with such legal
obligation.

 

Section 4.2NORM, Wastes and Other Substances

 

.

 

Purchaser acknowledges that the Assets have been used for the exploration,
development, and production of Hydrocarbons and that there may be petroleum,
produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials located in, on or
under the Properties or associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites
included in the Assets may contain Hazardous Materials, including NORM. NORM
may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and equipment as
scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials, and equipment located on the
Properties or included in the Assets may contain Hazardous Materials,
including NORM. Hazardous Materials, including NORM, may have come in contact
with various environmental media, including without limitation, water, soils
or sediment. Special procedures may be required for the assessment,

 

18

 



  remediation, removal, transportation, or disposal of environmental media and
Hazardous Materials, including NORM, from the Assets.

 

Section 4.3Environmental Defects

 

.

 

If, as a result of its investigation pursuant to Section 4.1, Purchaser
determines that with respect to the Assets, there exists a violation of an
Environmental Law or an Environmental Liability (other than with respect to
NORM) (in each case, an "Environmental Defect"), then on or prior to February
23, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. C.D.T. (the "Environmental Claim Date"), Purchaser may
notify Seller in writing of such Environmental Defect (an "Environmental
Defect Notice"). FOR ALL PURPOSES OF THIS AGREEMENT, WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO ITS
RIGHTS UNDER SECTION 11.5(a) WITH RESPECT TO A BREACH OF SECTION 5.7, SECTION
5.12, SECTION 5.22 OR SECTION 5.23, PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED
ANY ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT WHICH PURCHASER FAILS TO ASSERT AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL
DEFECT BY AN ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT NOTICE RECEIVED BY SELLER ON OR BEFORE THE
ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM DATE. To be effective, each such notice shall set forth
(i) a description of the matter constituting the alleged Environmental Defect,
(ii) the Warranty Wells and associated Assets affected by the Environmental
Defect, (iii) the estimated Lowest Cost Response to eliminate the
Environmental Defect in question or the estimated cost to resolve the
Environmental Liability (the "Environmental Defect Amount"), and (iv)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence
of the alleged Environmental Defect and the Environmental Defect Amount.
Purchaser shall furnish Seller once every two weeks until the Environmental
Claim Date with an Environmental Defect Notice if any officer of Purchaser or
its Affiliates discover or become aware of an Environmental Defect during such
two-week period; further provided that, the failure of Purchaser to furnish
such notice shall not in any respect affect Purchaser's rights under this
Agreement nor limit its ability to assert Environmental Defects under this
Agreement. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any
Environmental Defect before Closing or, provided that the parties shall have
agreed to the general plan of remediation with respect to such Environmental
Defect and the time period by which such remediation shall take place, after
Closing. If Seller disagrees with any of Purchaser's assertions with respect
to the existence of an Environmental Defect or the Environmental Defect
Amount, Purchaser and Seller will attempt to resolve the dispute prior to
Closing. If the dispute cannot be resolved within ten (10) days of the first
meeting of Purchaser and Seller, either party may submit the dispute to an
environmental consultant approved in writing by Seller and Purchaser that is
experienced in environmental corrective action at oil and gas properties in
the relevant jurisdiction and that shall not have performed professional
services for either party or any of their respective Affiliates during the
previous three years (the "Independent Expert"). If the Parties are unable to
mutually agree upon the Independent Expert, the Houston, Texas office of the
AAA shall appoint the Independent Expert under such conditions as the AAA in
its sole discretion deems necessary or advisable, except that the Independent
Expert shall not have any financial interest in either Party or any of its
Affiliates. The Independent Expert may elect to conduct the dispute
resolution proceeding by written submissions from Purchaser and Seller with
exhibits, including interrogatories, supplemented with appearances by
Purchaser and Seller, if necessary, as the Independent Expert may deem
necessary. After the parties and Independent Expert have had the opportunity
to review all such submissions, the Independent Expert shall call for a final,
written offer of resolution from each party. The Independent Expert shall
render its decision within fifteen (15) Business Days of

 

19

 



  receiving such offers by selecting one or the other of the offers, or by
crafting a decision that represents a compromise between the two offers. The
Independent Expert may not award damages, interest or penalties to either
party with respect to any matter. The decision of the Independent Expert
shall be final and binding upon both parties, without right of appeal. Seller
and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting
its case to the Independent Expert. Each party shall bear one-half of the
costs and expenses of the Independent Expert. The parties shall adjust the
Purchase Price to reflect the Environmental Defect Amounts, as agreed by the
parties or as determined by the Independent Expert, for all uncured
Environmental Defects; provided, that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, (a) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price
for any individual uncured Environmental Defect for which the Environmental
Defect Amount therefor does not exceed $50,000 ("Individual Environmental
Threshold"); and (b) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price for any uncured Environmental Defect unless the aggregate
Environmental Defect Amount attributable to all such Environmental Defects,
taken together with the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to all
uncured Title Defects, exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible, after which
point Purchaser shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or
other remedies only with respect to uncured Title Defects and uncured
Environmental Defects where the aggregate Title Defect Amounts and
Environmental Defect Amounts attributable thereto are in excess of such
Aggregate Defect Deductible. To the extent the Independent Expert fails to
determine any disputed Environmental Defect Amounts prior to Closing, then,
within ten (10) days after the Independent Expert delivers written notice to
Purchaser and Seller of his award with respect to an Environmental Defect
Amount, the Parties shall execute and deliver a joint instruction to the
Escrow Agent requiring the Escrow Agent to make the payment described in the
award of the Independent Expert.

and Section 9, such carve-outs, the "Section 8 and 9 Exceptions") of that
certain confidentiality agreement dated September 22, 2017 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), by and between Seller and Revolution Resources,
LLC, a legal entity formed under the laws of Oklahoma, and any applicable
Contracts or Surface Contracts, in accordance with their terms. From the
Execution Date until the Closing, Purchaser and Seller hereby adopt and agree
to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement (other than the Section 8 and 9
Exceptions) with the same force and effect as if Purchaser and Seller were the
original parties thereto and originally subject thereto, and Seller shall be
entitled to the rights (other than the Section 8 and 9 Exceptions) and subject

"Disclosing Party" thereunder and Purchaser shall be entitled to the rights
(other than the Section 8 and 9 Exceptions) and subject to the obligations

transferability or assignability of operatorship of any Seller Operated
Assets. Rights and obligations associated with operatorship of such
Properties are governed by operating and similar agreements covering the
Properties and will be determined in accordance with the terms of such
agreements. However, Seller will assist Purchaser in Purchaser's efforts to
succeed Seller or Seller's Affiliate as operator of any Wells and Unit
included in the Assets. Purchaser shall, promptly following Closing, file all
appropriate forms and declarations or bonds with federal and state agencies

.

 

Until the Closing, neither Seller nor Purchaser nor any of their Affiliates
shall make any press release or other public announcement regarding the
existence of this Agreement, the contents hereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the others; provided,
however, the foregoing shall not restrict disclosures by Purchaser or Seller
which are required by applicable securities or other laws or regulations or
the applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the
disclosing party or its Affiliates. At or after Closing, the content of any
press release or public announcement first announcing the consummation of this
transaction shall be subject to the prior review and reasonable approval of
Seller and Purchaser; provided, however, the foregoing shall not restrict
disclosures by Purchaser or Seller or any of their Affiliates which are
required by applicable securities or other laws or regulations or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the disclosing
party or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no
press release issued by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller shall identify
Purchaser as the buyer of the Assets without the

 

30

 



  prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent may be withheld in the sole
discretion of Purchaser.

 

Section 7.6Operation of Business

 

.

 

Except as set forth on Schedule 7.6, from the Execution Date until the
Closing, Seller (i) will operate the Assets and the business thereof as a
reasonably prudent operator and consistent with past practices, (ii) will not,
without the prior written consent of Purchaser commit to any operation, or
series of related operations thereon, reasonably anticipated to require future
capital expenditures by Purchaser as owner of the Assets in excess of
$150,000, or make any capital expenditures in respect of the Assets in excess
of $150,000, or terminate, materially amend, execute or extend any material
contracts affecting the Assets; provided however that this subsection (ii)

Assets, (vi) will not transfer, farmout, sell, hypothecate, encumber or
otherwise dispose of any Assets, except for (A) sales and dispositions of
Hydrocarbon production in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices and/or (B) transfers, farmouts, hypothecations, encumbrances or
other dispositions of Assets, in one or more transactions, not exceeding

Governmental Body, or make or change any election with respect to Taxes,
relating to the Assets, (viii) will not terminate or materially amend the
terms of any Material Contract; (ix) will not enter into any Contract that, if
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be listed as a Material Contract on Schedule 1.2(d), or amend the terms of any
Contract that is not currently a Material Contract that, if so amended prior
to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been listed as
a Material Contract on Schedule 1.2(d), (x) will not settle any suit or
litigation or waive any material claims or rights of material value, in each
case, attributable to the Assets and affecting the period after the Effective
Time, (xi) give prompt written notice to Purchaser of (A) any written notice
(1) received regarding material spills, other environmental contamination or
remediation obligations relating to the Assets, (2) of any material claim
asserting any breach of Contract, tort or violation of Law, or (3) any
investigation, suit, action or litigation by or before any Governmental Body,
that in each case, has been received by Seller and relates to the Assets, (B)
any material spills or other material environmental contamination events
occurring with respect to the Assets operated by Seller or its Affiliates and
(C) any material damage to or destruction of the Assets operated by Seller or
its Affiliates, and (xii) will not commit to do any of the foregoing in
subsections (ii), (vii), (viii), (ix) or (x). Purchaser's approval of any
action restricted by this Section 7.6 shall be considered granted within ten
(10) days (unless a shorter time is reasonably required by the circumstances
and such shorter time is specified in Seller's written notice) after Seller's
written notice to Purchaser requesting such consent unless Purchaser notifies
Seller to the contrary in writing during that period. In the event of an
emergency to protect life or property, Seller may take such action as a
prudent operator would take and shall notify Purchaser of such action promptly
thereafter.

 

31

 



  Purchaser acknowledges that Seller may own an undivided interest in certain of
the Assets, and Purchaser agrees that the acts or omissions of the other
working interest owners who are not affiliated with Seller shall not
constitute a violation of the provisions of this Section 7.6 nor shall any
action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute such a
violation so long as Seller has voted its interest in a manner consistent with
the provisions of this Section 7.6.

 

Section 7.7Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements

 

.

 

(a)The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are expressly subject to
all validly existing and applicable Preference Rights and Transfer
Requirements. Within three Business Days after the date of the execution of
this Agreement, Seller shall initiate all procedures which are reasonably
required to comply with or obtain the waiver of all Preference Rights and
Transfer Requirements set forth in Schedule 5.13. If additional Preference
Rights and/or Transfer Requirements are identified by either Party after the
date of the execution of this Agreement, within three Business Days after the
discovery of such Preference Right and/or Transfer Requirement, Seller shall
initiate all procedures which are reasonably required to comply with or obtain
the waiver of all such Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all applicable consents and to
obtain waivers of applicable Preference Rights; provided, however, Seller
shall not be obligated to pay any consideration to (or incur any cost or
expense for the benefit of) the holder of any Preference Right or Transfer
Requirement in order to obtain the waiver thereof or compliance therewith. 

 

(b)If the holder of a Preference Right elects prior to Closing to purchase the
Asset subject to a Preference Right (a "Preference Property") in accordance
with the terms of such Preference Right, and Seller receives written notice of
such election prior to the Closing, such Preference Property will be
eliminated from the Assets and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of the Preference Property.

 

(c)If

 

    



 |  

(i)

 |  

a third party brings any suit, action or other proceeding prior to the Closing
seeking to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a claim to enforce a
Preference Right; 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(ii)

 |  

an Asset is subject to a Transfer Requirement that provides that transfer of
such Asset without compliance with such Transfer Requirement will result in
termination, the right of the counterparty to terminate, or other material
impairment of any rights in relation to such Asset, and such Transfer
Requirement is not waived, complied with or otherwise satisfied prior to the
Closing Date; or 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(iii)

 |  

the holder of a Preference Right does not elect to purchase such Preference
Property or waive such Preference Right with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing Date and the time in which
the Preference Right may be exercised has not expired; 

---|---|--- 

 

32

 



  then, unless otherwise agreed by Seller and Purchaser, the Asset or portion
thereof affected by such Preference Right or Transfer Requirement (a "Retained
Asset") shall be held back from the Assets to be transferred and conveyed to
Purchaser at Closing and the Purchase Price to be paid at Closing shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such Retained Asset pursuant to Section
7.7(b). Any Retained Asset so held back at the initial Closing will be
conveyed to Purchaser at a delayed Closing (which shall become the new Closing
Date with respect to such Retained Asset), within ten (10) days following the
date on which the suit, action or other proceeding, if any, referenced in
clause (i) above is settled or a judgment is rendered (and no longer subject
to appeal) permitting transfer of the Retained Asset to Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement and Seller obtains, complies with, obtains a waiver of or
notice of election not to exercise or otherwise satisfies all remaining
Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements with respect to such Retained
Asset as contemplated by this Section 7.7(c) (or if multiple Assets are
Retained Assets, on a date mutually agreed to by the parties in order to
consolidate, to the extent reasonably possible, the number of Closings). At
the delayed Closing, Purchaser shall pay Seller a purchase price equal to the
amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced on account of the holding back
of such Retained Asset (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2 through the new
Closing Date therefor); provided, however, if all such Preference Rights and
Transfer Requirements with respect to any Retained Asset so held back at the
initial Closing are not obtained, complied with, waived or otherwise satisfied
as contemplated by this Section 7.7 within one hundred eighty (180) days after
the initial Closing has occurred with respect to any Asset, then such Retained
Asset shall be eliminated from the Assets and shall become an Excluded Asset,
unless Seller and Purchaser agree to proceed with a closing on such Retained
Asset, in which case Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any objection
(and shall be obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Persons for all
Losses) with respect to non-compliance with such Preference Rights and
Transfer Requirements with respect to such Retained Asset(s).

 

Section 7.8Tax Matters

 

.

 

(a)Asset Taxes. 

 

    



 |  

(i)

 |  

Purchaser shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to any Tax
period (or portion thereof) beginning at or after the Effective Time, and
Seller shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to any Tax
period (or portion thereof) ending before the Effective Time. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(ii)

 |  

For purposes of determining the allocations described in Section 7.8(a)(i),
(A) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production of
Hydrocarbons (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause (C), below)
shall be allocated to the period in which the severance or production giving
rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, (B) Asset Taxes that are based upon or
related to sales or receipts or imposed on a transactional basis (other than
such Asset Taxes described in clause (A) or (C)), shall be allocated to the
period in which the transaction giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, and
(C) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other Asset Taxes imposed on
a periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between
the portion of such Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective
Time and the portion of such Straddle 

---|---|--- 

 

33

 



      



 |  |  

Period beginning at the Effective Time by prorating each such Asset Tax based
on the number of days in the applicable Straddle Period that occur before the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the number of
days in such Straddle Period that occur on or after the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, on the other hand. For purposes of clause (C) of the
preceding sentence, the period for such Asset Taxes shall begin on the date on
which ownership of the applicable Assets gives rise to liability for the
particular Asset Tax and shall end on the day before the next such date. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(iii)

 |  

To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not known at the time an
adjustment is to be made with respect to such Asset Tax pursuant to Section
2.2 or Section 9.4, as applicable, the Parties shall utilize the most recent
information available in estimating the amount of such Asset Tax for purposes
of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax (or the
amount thereof paid or economically borne by a Party) is ultimately determined
to be different than the amount (if any) that was taken into account in the
Final Settlement Statement as finally determined pursuant to Section 9.4,
timely payments will be made from one Party to the other to the extent
necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of such Asset Tax that is
allocable to such Party under this Section 7.8(a). 

---|---|--- 

 

(b)Tax Returns. Seller shall handle payment to the appropriate Governmental
Body of all Asset Taxes which are required to be paid on or prior to the
Closing Date (and shall file all Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes).
Except as otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement, Purchaser
shall (i) pay all Asset Taxes relating to any Tax period that ends before or
includes the Effective Time that become due and payable after the Closing Date
and shall file with the appropriate Governmental Body any and all Tax Returns
required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to such Asset Taxes,
and (ii) provide a copy of each such Tax Return to Seller reasonably in
advance of the due date for filing such Tax Return for Seller's review and
approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Parties agree that
(x) this Section 7.8(b) is intended to solely address the timing and manner in
which certain Tax Returns relating to Asset Taxes are filed and the Asset
Taxes shown thereon are paid to the applicable taxing authority, and (y)
nothing in this Section 7.8(b) shall be interpreted as altering the manner in
which such Asset Taxes are allocated to and economically borne by the Parties
(except for any penalties, interest or additions to Tax imposed as a result of
any breach by a Party of its obligations under this Section 7.8(b), which
shall be borne by such Party).

 

(c)Cooperation. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing
of any Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other Proceeding with respect
to Taxes relating to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
Proceeding and making employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Each of Purchaser and Seller agrees (i) to retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating
to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the

 

34

 



  expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by
Purchaser or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Governmental Body, and (ii) to give the other party reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if the other party so requests, each party shall allow the other party
the option of taking possession of such books and records prior to their
disposal. 

 

(d)Purchase Price Allocation. The Adjusted Purchase Price (plus any other
amounts properly treated as consideration under the Code), shall be allocated
among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local
or foreign law, as appropriate) (the "Allocation"). The first draft of the
Allocation shall be delivered by Purchaser to Seller within thirty days after
delivery of the Final Settlement Statement, for Seller's review and comment.
As soon as reasonably practicable but not later than the 30th day following
receipt of Purchaser's draft of the Allocation hereunder, Seller shall deliver
to Purchaser a written report containing any changes that Seller proposes be
made to such Allocation. Seller and Purchaser shall work in good faith to
resolve any disputes relating to the Allocation within thirty days. If Seller
and Purchaser are unable to resolve any such dispute, such dispute shall be
resolved promptly by a nationally recognized accounting firm acceptable to
Purchaser and Seller, the costs of which shall be borne by Seller and
Purchaser equally. If the Adjusted Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to
this Agreement, the Allocation shall be adjusted as mutually agreed by
Purchaser and Seller. Purchaser and Seller shall file all Tax Returns
(including, but not limited to, Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) consistent
with the Allocation. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall take any Tax position
inconsistent with such Allocation; provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall prevent Purchaser or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency
or adjustment by any Governmental Body based upon or arising out of the
Allocation, and neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be required to litigate
before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental
Body challenging such Allocation. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall promptly
notify the other in writing upon receipt of notice of any pending or
threatened Tax audit or assessment challenging the Allocation.

 

(e)Notice of Audits. Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing upon
receipt by Seller, from and after the date hereof and until the Closing, of
notice of any pending or threatened Asset Tax audits or assessments that
reasonably may be expected to give rise to a Lien on the Assets.

 

(f)Tax Treatment. Any payments made to any Party pursuant to Article 11 shall
constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for U.S. federal and applicable
state income Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by Purchaser and Seller
on their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by Laws.

 

Section 7.9Further Assurances

 

.

 

After the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances,
transfer orders, division orders, notices assumptions, releases and
acquittances, and such other instruments, and shall take such further actions
as may be necessary or appropriate to assure fully to Purchaser or Seller
(including their successors and assigns) as the case may be, that the
transactions described in this Agreement

 

35

 



  shall be completed and that all of the Properties intended to be conveyed
under the terms of this Agreement are so conveyed, including such Properties
that are improperly described herein or inadvertently omitted from this
Agreement and/or the Conveyance (including the Exhibits attached to each) and
to assure fully that Purchaser has assumed the liabilities and obligations
intended to be assumed by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 7.10Transition Services Agreement

 

. From and after the Execution Date, Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in
good faith and use their commercially reasonable efforts to agree to the form
of the Transition Services Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable, but in
any event prior to the Closing, which agreement shall be based on the
Transition Services Agreement Term Sheet attached hereto as Exhibit C.

Purchaser shall have the opportunity to review and discuss the preliminary
settlement statement with Seller; provided, however, Seller shall not be

as may be mutually accepted by Purchaser and Seller, for review and final
determination (the "Agreed Accounting Firm"). Each party shall summarize its
position with regard to the remaining matters in dispute in a written document
of twenty-five pages or less and submit such summaries to the Agreed
Accounting Firm, together with any other documentation such party may desire
to submit. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after receiving the parties'
respective submissions, the Agreed Accounting Firm shall render in writing a
decision choosing either Seller's position or Purchaser's position or a
position in between those (but in no event higher or lower than the amounts
proposed in the post-Closing statements exchanged between the parties, as
described earlier in this subsection) based on the materials described above.
The Agreed Accounting Firm may not award damages or penalties to either party.
Any decision rendered by the Agreed Accounting Firm pursuant hereto shall,
without limiting Section 7.8(a)(iii), be final, conclusive and binding on
Seller and Purchaser and will be enforceable against any of the parties in any
court of competent jurisdiction. The fees of the Agreed Accounting Firm shall
be borne and paid one-half by Sellers and one-half by Purchaser. Seller and
Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case. Within ten (10) Business Days after the date on which the parties or
the Agreed Accounting Firm, as applicable, finally determines the disputed
matters, (x) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount by which the Final
Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Payment or (y) Seller shall pay to
Purchaser the amount by which the Closing Payment exceeds the Final Purchase
Price, as applicable. Any post-Closing payment pursuant to this Section
9.4(b) shall bear interest at the Agreed Interest Rate from (but not
including) the Closing Date to (and including) the date of such payment. Any
Defect Escrow Amount not released pursuant to Section 3.4(c)(iii) shall be
released to the Party entitled to such amount upon final resolution of such
unresolved dispute. 

 

(c)All payments made or to be made hereunder to Seller shall be by electronic
transfer of immediately available funds to the account, designated by Seller
to Purchaser in writing at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing

bank and account specified by Purchaser in writing to Seller.

matters for which a Party has an indemnity obligation pursuant to Article 11,
there shall be no adjustment for, or obligation to pay, any Property Costs
between the Parties following the date that is three years after the Closing
Date (the "Cut-off Date").

described in Exhibit C in accordance with the terms thereof. The Parties
agree that (a) the terms of this Section 9.5 are being relied upon by
Purchaser as a basis for executing the Agreement, (b) Exhibit C contains all
of the material terms necessary for the Parties to agree upon regarding the
conduct of the transition services from and after Closing, and (c) Exhibit C
shall be deemed to be a valid and fully enforceable

 

40

 



  contact from and after Closing. Nothing in this Section 9.5 shall be deemed
to relieve a Party for a breach of any of its obligations pursuant to Section
7.10. 

 

Section 9.6Certain Seller Employees and Contractors

 

.

 

Within five Business Days after the Execution Date, Seller shall provide
Purchaser a list in writing of all current field employees and field
contractors of Seller and its Affiliates that, in the twelve months prior to
the Execution Date reported to or were located at the WEHLU Field Office (as
described on Schedule 1.2(i)). Seller shall provide Purchaser reasonable
access to such employees and contractors for the purposes of interviewing and
making offers of employment and/or contracts to those employees and
contractors that Purchaser desires to hire, and Seller agrees that it shall
not obstruct or delay Purchaser's efforts to interview, make offers or hire
any such employees or contractors that Seller desires to hire.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any agreement between Purchaser or
its Affiliates on one hand and Seller or its Affiliates on the other hand,
Purchaser shall not be subject to any non-solicitation covenant with respect
to any such employees or contractors.

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(ii)

 |  

there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise prohibited or a Governmental Body
shall have issued an order, decree, or ruling or taken any other action
permanently restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and such order, decree, ruling, or
other action shall have become final and non-appealable; 

---|---|--- 

 

(c)by Seller, if any of its conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.1(a),

Section 9.2, all of the conditions in Section 8.2 (excluding conditions that,

Section 10.2Effect of Termination

become void and of no further force or effect and the parties shall have no
liability or obligation hereunder (except for the provisions of Section 4.4,
Section 5.6, Section 6.5, Section 7.5, Section 11.9 and Section 11.10 of this
Agreement and this Article 10, the Section entitled "Definitions," and Article
12 (other than Section 12.6), all of which shall continue in full force and
effect). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section
10.2 shall relieve any party from liability for Losses resulting from its
breach of this Agreement. If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(c), then the Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the
Deposit to Seller as its sole and exclusive remedy. If Purchaser terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(d), then the Parties shall instruct
the Escrow Agent to pay the Deposit to Purchaser and Purchaser shall be
entitled to seek actual damages suffered by Purchaser resulting therefrom as
Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy, or in lieu of terminating this
Agreement, Purchaser shall be entitled to seek specific performance by Seller,
provided that nothing herein shall preclude Purchaser from first seeking
specific performance and subsequently terminating this Agreement and seeking
actual damages. If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1(f), then Seller shall be entitled to seek actual damages suffered by
Seller resulting therefrom. Seller specifically waives any right to specific
performance in the event of such termination and acknowledges and agrees that
the exact damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement are
difficult to ascertain and that the amount of the Deposit constitutes a
reasonable estimate of such damages to Seller. If this Agreement is
terminated for any other reason other than in accordance with the previous
three sentences, then the Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to return
the Deposit (without interest) to Purchaser within five (5) Business Days of
such termination, and neither party shall have any further rights, remedies or
obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided in this Section 10.2.

survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period,
plus 30 days. Upon the termination of a representation or warranty in
accordance with the foregoing, such representation or warranty shall have no
further force or effect for any purpose under this Agreement. The covenants
and other agreements of Seller and Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing Date until fully performed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the covenants and agreements in Section 7.8 and Section 12.3 shall
survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period,
plus 30 days.

 

(b)The indemnities set forth in Section 11.5(a), Section 11.5(b), Section
11.6(a), and Section 11.6(b) shall terminate as of the expiration date of each
respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to

unless it shall have received from the party seeking indemnification a written
notice (a "Claim Notice") of the existence of the claim for or in respect of
which indemnification in respect of such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement is being sought on or before the expiration of the applicable
survival period set forth in Section 11.4(a). If an Indemnified Party

applicable survival period set forth in Section 11.4(a), then the applicable
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive until, but only
for purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such Claim Notice. A
Claim Notice shall set forth with reasonable specificity (1) the basis for
such claim under this Agreement, and the facts that otherwise form the basis
of such claim and (2) to the extent reasonably estimable, an

foregoing limitation shall have no application to breaches of Fundamental
Representations.

Section 11.7Indemnification Proceedings

 

.

 

(a)In the event that any claim or demand for which Seller or Purchaser (such
Person, an "Indemnifying Party") may be liable to a Purchaser Indemnified
Person under Section 11.5 or to a Seller Indemnified Person under Section 11.6
(an "Indemnified Party") is asserted against or sought to be collected from an
Indemnified Party by a third party (a "Third Party Claim,") the Indemnified
Party shall with reasonable promptness notify the Indemnifying Party of such
Third Party Claim by delivery of a Claim Notice, provided that the failure or
delay to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this Article 11, except (and solely) to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that its defense of such Third
Party Claim is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying
Party shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the Claim Notice from the
Indemnified Party (in this Section 11.7, the "Notice Period") to notify the
Indemnified Party whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires, at the
Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party
against such claim or demand; provided, that the Indemnified Party is hereby
authorized prior to and during the Notice Period, and at the cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that
it shall reasonably deem necessary to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim only if and for so long as the Indemnifying
Party (i) notifies the Indemnified Party during the Notice Period that the
Indemnifying Party is assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim, (ii)
uses counsel of its own choosing that is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, and (iii) conducts the defense of such Third Party Claim in
an active and diligent manner. If the Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and
does, assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel at its own expense and to
participate in the defense thereof; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable attorneys' fees
of the Indemnified Party if the Indemnified Party's

 

48

 



  counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party that there is a conflict of
interest that could make it inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct to have common counsel for the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party (provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
responsible for paying for more than one separate firm of attorneys and one
local counsel to represent all of the Indemnified Parties subject to such
Third Party Claim). If the Indemnifying Party elects (and is entitled) to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, (i) no compromise or settlement
thereof or consent to any admission or the entry of any judgment with respect
to such Third Party Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without
the Indemnified Party's written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the sole relief provided is monetary
damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party (and no injunctive or
other equitable relief is imposed upon the Indemnified Party) and there is an
unconditional provision whereby each plaintiff or claimant in such Third Party
Claim releases the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto
and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to any
compromise or settlement thereof effected without its written consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim (or fails to give notice to the
Indemnified Party during the Notice Period or otherwise is not entitled to
assume such defense), the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its own choice, at the
expense and for the account of the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that
the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on the part of any
Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 

(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled
to control (but shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the
defense of), and the Indemnified Party, shall be entitled to have sole control
over, the defense or settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of
any Third Party Claim (i) at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party,
as to which the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense during the
Notice Period after the Indemnified Party gives notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party or (ii) at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying
Party, to the extent the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction, or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party which, if successful,
could materially adversely affect the business, condition (financial or
other), capitalization, assets, liabilities, results of operations or
prospects of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall make no
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to
liability on the part of the Indemnifying Party without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c)In any case in which an Indemnified Party seeks indemnification hereunder
and no Third Party Claim is involved, the Indemnified Party shall deliver a
Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party within a reasonably prompt period of
time after an officer of such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates has obtained
knowledge of the Loss giving rise to indemnification hereunder. The failure
or delay to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article 11 except to the
extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the
Indemnifying Party to effectively mitigate the resulting Losses or otherwise
prejudices the Indemnifying Party.
