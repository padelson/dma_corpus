in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement.

 

B. Following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser will be merged with
and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company continuing as the

a condition and inducement to Parents and Purchasers willingness to enter
into this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser have entered into agreements with
certain stockholders of the Company, pursuant to which, among other things,
such stockholders have irrevocably agreed to tender the Shares beneficially
owned by such Persons in the Offer (each, a " _Support Agreement_ " and,

any period required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position

Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by
Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository
acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(e) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement
of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act),
Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ")
that will contain as an exhibit the Offer to Purchase and forms of the letter
of transmittal and summary advertisement and other customary ancillary
documents and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares together with all amendments or supplements
thereto as may be required by any Legal Requirement (the " _Offer Documents_
"). The Offer Documents filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC shall
comply in all material respects with applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable
Legal Requirements, and shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omission of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading;  _provided_ , that no representation, warranty or covenant is
made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer
Documents. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and Parent further agrees to take all steps necessary
to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to
be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall
promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or
Parents legal counsel all information concerning the Company and the
Companys stockholders, and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably
requested, in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(e).
The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC
(and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable consideration to any comments
provided by the Company or its

 



3\.

 counsel). Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel
with any comments Parent, Purchaser or their respective counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall respond promptly
to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or
the Offer. Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to
any such comments of the SEC or its staff and, to the extent participation is
permitted by the SEC or such staff, a reasonable opportunity to
participate in any discussions with the SEC or its staff concerning such
comments.

(f) Payment; Funds. On the terms and subject to the conditions specified
herein and subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent waivable by Parent or
Purchaser, waiver of the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to, irrevocably accept for payment at the Offer Acceptance
Time and pay for, all of the Shares validly tendered (and not properly
withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable after the Offer
Acceptance Time; _provided_ , that with respect to Shares tendered pursuant
to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in
settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee, Purchaser shall be under no
obligation to make any payment for such Shares unless and until such Shares
are delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee. Without
limiting the generality of Section 9.10, Parent shall cause to be provided to
Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause
Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchasers obligations under
this Agreement.

 

(g) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
(including Section 1.1(b)), if, between the date of this Agreement and the
Offer Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Offer Price shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to provide the holders of Shares with the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided,_ that, in
any case, nothing in this Section 1.1(g) shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) Schedule 14D-9. The Company shall file with the SEC, concurrently with
the filing by Parent and Purchaser of the Schedule TO, and disseminate to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that, subject to Section 6.1(b),
shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and include the notice and
other information contemplated by and required to be delivered under Section
262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule
14D-9 to comply in all material respects with applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable
Legal Requirements, and shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omission of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading; _provided_ , that no representation, warranty or covenant is made
by the Company with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent
or Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule
14D-9. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly
to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Purchaser shall promptly
furnish or otherwise make available to Company or its legal counsel all
information concerning Parent and Purchaser and their stockholders and
provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any action contemplated by this Section 1.2(a). Parent and its counsel

their counsel). The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any
comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments. The

Company Board or the Company Special Committee effects a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation or has formally determined to do so. Company shall
provide Parent and Purchaser and their respective counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to any such
comments of the SEC or its staff and, to the extent participation is permitted
by the SEC or such staff, a reasonable opportunity to participate in any

shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9.

 

(b) Stockholder Lists. The Company shall or shall cause its transfer agent

listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all record or
beneficial holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held
in stock depositories, in each case accurate and complete as of the most
recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional
information (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists
of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with the Offer. Parent and Purchaser and their agents
shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such files, shall
use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if
this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and shall
use their reasonable efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company
(or destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information
then in their possession or control in accordance with the Confidentiality

Time (other than any Rollover Shares and Dissenting Shares, as defined below)
shall be canceled and cease to exist and shall be converted into the right to

reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,

6\.

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 the funds to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 2.5. The agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying
Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. At
or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to make payment of Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.5 (together, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed
by the United States of America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or

Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no
such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed
to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of the
Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5 a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in reasonable and customary
form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the " _Certificates_ ")
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent) and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on
the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of
any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is
registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be
a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed
properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of Shares upon their surrender or transfer for
exchange in accordance with this Section 2.6 shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares.

 

(c) At any time following 12 months after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed
to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including, all interest and
other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made
available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other
similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect
to the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Neither Parent, Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in
respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving
Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(e) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Purchaser, and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct or
withhold therefrom under applicable Tax Legal Requirements; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that before making any such deduction or withholding, Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to the Company notice of
any applicable payors intention to make such deduction or withholding, which
notice shall include the authority, basis and method of calculation for the
proposed deduction or withholding, and Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such notice within a commercially reasonable
period of time before such deduction or withholding is required in order for
the Company to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction or
withholding from the applicable Governmental Body or execute and deliver to or
file with such Governmental Body or Purchaser such affidavits, certificates
and other documents to afford to the Company and its stockholders reduction
of or relief from such deduction or withholding, except, no such notice shall
be required with respect to payments to current or former employees of the
Company or any predecessor of the Company with respect to Company Options or
any options to acquire capital stock of any predecessor of the Company. To the
extent that such amounts are so deducted and withheld, each such payor shall
take all action as may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so
withheld are timely and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Body, and such amounts so remitted shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger Consideration
payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay (less any
amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Section 2. 

2.7 Dissenters Rights. Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and held by holders who are entitled to demand appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected
their respective demands for appraisal of such shares in the time and manner
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and
payment under the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be entitled to only such consideration as shall be determined pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL (and, at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and such
holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the consideration determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL);
_provided,_ that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL, such holders Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant
to Section 2.6(e)), and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting
Shares. Within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide each of the holders of Dissenting Shares with the
second notice contemplated by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The Company will
provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of any Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other
demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the DGCL or other applicable Legal Requirement that relates
to such demand, and Parent will have the opportunity and right to participate
in and, and after the Offer Acceptance

 Time direct, all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company will not make any
payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands, or
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in
accordance with the DGCL, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

2.8 Treatment of Company Options. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the holders
thereof, Parent, Purchaser or the Company, each Company Option that is then
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately before the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled, extinguished and terminated
for no consideration or payment.

 

2.9 Treatment of Company Warrants. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the holders
thereof, Parent, Purchaser or the Company, each Company Warrant that is
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately before the Effective Time shall
be canceled, and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive
solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect
thereto, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (a) the number of
Shares for which such Company Warrant would have converted to had it been
exercised and (b) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of such Company Warrant (and for the avoidance of
doubt, any Company Warrant that has an exercise price that is greater than or
equal to the Merger Consideration shall be canceled at the Effective Time for
no consideration or payment). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
deliver notice of the Transactions to the holders of Company Warrants in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Warrant Agreement and shall cause
such Warrant Agreement to be terminated with no outstanding liability to or
obligations of the Acquired Corporations, Parent or Purchaser, other than as
set forth in this Agreement.

2.10 Loan Payoff. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall satisfy all
notification requirements under the terms of any Indebtedness. The Company
shall obtain prior to the Closing payoff letters in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the " _Payoff Letters_ ") from the lenders
or other applicable third Persons (or an authorized agent on behalf thereof)
with respect to any Indebtedness outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and set forth on Part 2.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(and shall deliver to Parent drafts of the Payoff Letters for its review at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date), which Payoff Letters
shall (a) provide the dollar amount of all such Indebtedness required to be
paid in order to fully pay off such Indebtedness as of the Closing and (b)
provide for releases in customary forms concurrently with the repayment of
obligations giving rise thereto of all Encumbrances with respect to the
capital stock, property and assets of the Acquired Corporations relating to
such Indebtedness (other than any obligation which, pursuant to the terms of
the credit agreements, expressly survives termination), with the result
that immediately following the Closing, there shall be no further monetary
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any such
Indebtedness outstanding immediately prior to the Closing. Parent and/or
Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid in full, on the Closing Date, such
amount set forth in the Payoff Letters.

 

2.11 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in
the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

basis all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein and

respective dates, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents and, except to
the extent that information contained in such Company SEC Document has been
revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior to the date of
this Agreement) by a later filed Company SEC Document, none of the Company
SEC Documents when filed or furnished contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the
Subsidiaries of the Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act.

schedules) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except
as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or as permitted
by Regulation S-X, or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange
Act); and (iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of the Company and

the Company are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company. Since February 2, 2018, there has been no material
change in the Companys accounting methods or principles that would be
required to be disclosed in the Companys financial statements in accordance
with GAAP, except as described in the notes thereto.

February 2, 2018, has maintained, a system of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) which is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and

3.17 Environmental Matters. 

(a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Acquired
Corporations, each Acquired Corporation is and has been in compliance in all
respects with all applicable Environmental Laws, including obtaining,
maintaining in good standing, and complying with all Governmental
Authorizations required for its business and operations by Environmental Laws
(" _Environmental Permits_ "), and, to the Companys Knowledge, no facts,
circumstances, or conditions currently exist that could adversely affect such
continued compliance with Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits or
require capital expenditures to achieve or maintain such continued compliance
with Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits. No material
Legal Proceeding is pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened to
revoke, modify, or terminate any such Environmental Permit.

 

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Acquired
Corporations: (i) no Acquired Corporation has manufactured, treated, stored,
disposed of, arranged for or permitted the disposal of, generated, handled or
Released any Hazardous Material, or owned or operated any property or
facility, in a manner that has given or would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any liability or obligation under applicable Environmental Laws; and
(ii) no fact, circumstance, or condition exists in respect of any
Acquired Corporation or any property currently or formerly owned, operated,
or leased by any Acquired Corporation or any property to which an Acquired
Corporation arranged for the disposal or treatment of Hazardous Materials that
could reasonably be expected to result in an Acquired Corporation incurring
any liability or obligation under applicable Environmental Laws.

 3.18 Insurance. The Acquired Corporations are insured by insurers of
recognized financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in such
amounts as are prudent and customary in the businesses in which they are
engaged. All premiums due and payable under all such insurance policies have
been timely paid and the Acquired Corporations are otherwise in compliance
with the terms of such insurance policies, except for such non-compliance as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Acquired Corporations. No Acquired
Corporation has any self-insurance or co-insurance programs. Since February 2,
2018, no Acquired Corporation has received any notice from, or on behalf of,
any insurance carrier relating to or involving any adverse change or any
change other than in the ordinary course of business, in the conditions of
insurance, any refusal to issue an insurance policy or non-renewal of a
policy. Since February 2, 2018, no Acquired Corporation has been refused any
insurance coverage sought or applied for, and no Acquired Corporation has any
reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance
coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from
similar insurers at a cost that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Acquired Corporations.

 

3.19 Legal Proceedings; Orders.

 

(a) There is no material Legal Proceeding pending against or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against an Acquired Corporation or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, against any present or former officer, director

writ, injunction or judgment to which an Acquired Corporation is subject that
is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Body with respect to an Acquired Corporation is pending or is being

registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain any such consent, decision, declaration, approval, clearance or waiver,
or expiration or termination of a waiting period by or from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Body, in each case in connection
with the HSR Act, under other applicable Antitrust Laws or pursuant to 31
C.F.R. Part 801; (ii) obtaining all necessary consents, authorizations,
approvals or waivers from third parties (other than Governmental Bodies); and
(iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Transactions.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, but subject to
the limitations contained in Section 6.2(f), the Parties agree to promptly
take, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to take, all actions and steps
requested or required by any Governmental Body as a condition to granting any
consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance or approval, and to cause
the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and to
resolve objections, if any, of the FTC, the DOJ, or other Governmental Bodies
of any other jurisdiction for which consent, permit, authorization, waiver,
clearance, approval and expiration or termination of the waiting period is
sought with respect to the Transactions, so as to obtain such consent,
permit, authorization, waiver, clearance, approval or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act, such other Antitrust Laws or pursuant to 31
C.F.R. Part 801, and to avoid the commencement of a lawsuit by the FTC, the
DOJ or other Governmental Bodies under such other Antitrust Laws, and to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or delaying the Offer
Acceptance Time beyond the Expiration Date, including (i) negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, lease, license, divestiture or disposition of any
assets, rights, product lines, or businesses of the Company, Parent or any of

condition or restriction, if such action, commitment, agreement, condition or
restriction is binding on such applicable Persons only in the event the
Closing occurs. The Parties shall defend through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in court by any party, including any Governmental Body, under
Antitrust Laws in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated,
any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
that could restrain, delay, or prevent the Closing by the End Date; _provided_
that such litigation in no way limits the obligation of Purchaser and Parent
to take all actions and steps to eliminate each and every impediment
identified herein.

 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties hereto shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, if
applicable, to): (i) promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business

in each case, with respect to the Transactions; (ii) as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, make all other filings, notifications or

other consents required to be made with, or obtained from, any other
Governmental Bodies in connection with the Transactions.

6.2, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party hereto shall use its reasonable

connection with any filing or submission in connection with any investigation
or other inquiry, including allowing the other Parties to have a reasonable

each case, with respect to the Transactions, (iii) keep the other Parties
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action

_however_ that such material may be redacted as necessary to (1) comply with
contractual arrangements, (2) address legal privilege or confidentiality
concerns, and (3) comply with applicable Legal Requirement;  _provided_ ,
_further_ that such Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to find
alternative means of disclosing any such information restricted by
confidentiality concerns or attorney-client privilege or prohibited under
applicable Legal Requirement or by the terms of any agreement to which an
Parent, Purchaser or an Acquired Corporation is a party, (vi) subject to an
appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and
outside consultants retained by such counsel, and to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult in advance and cooperate with the other Parties and
consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with any
substantive communication, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum,
brief, argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and
(vii) except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Legal
Requirement, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the Transactions, each Party hereto
shall provide advance notice of and permit authorized Representatives of the
other Party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in advance in connection with any argument, opinion or
proposal to be made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. Each Party
shall supply as promptly as practicable such information, documentation, other
material or testimony that may be reasonably requested by any Governmental
Body, including by complying at the earliest reasonably practicable date with
any reasonable request for additional information, documents or other
materials received by any Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries from
any Governmental Body in connection with such applications or filings for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser shall pay all filing
fees under the HSR Act and for any filings required under foreign Antitrust
Laws, but the Company shall bear its own costs for the preparation of any
such filings. Neither Party shall commit to or agree with any Governmental
Body to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act,
or pull and refile under the HSR Act, or other applicable Antitrust Laws,
without the prior written consent of the other. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, (x) Parent and its Affiliates shall not be
obligated to provide or disclose to any other party, and no other party shall
have the right to receive or review, any information containing Parents or
its Affiliates confidential information or business secrets and (y) Parent
and Purchaser shall have the right to make (after considering in good faith
any objections raised by the Company) the final decision with respect to any
decision, strategy, plan, course of action or other matters relating to
effecting the obligations set forth in this Section 6.2 with respect to any
objections, if any, that a Governmental Body in the United States or any other
jurisdiction may assert with respect to the Transactions on behalf of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company to the fullest extent applicable.

 

(e) Parent agrees that it shall not acquire or agree to acquire any assets,
business or any Person, whether by merger, consolidation, purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in any Person or by any other
manner or engage in any other transaction or take any other action, if the
entering into of an agreement relating to or the consummation of such
acquisition, merger, consolidation or purchase or other transaction or action
would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period or impose any delay in the
obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization,
consent, clearance, approval or order of a Governmental Body necessary to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any approvals and expiration of waiting periods
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable Legal Requirements, (ii)
increase the risk of any Governmental Body entering, or increase the risk of
not being able to remove or successfully challenge, any

 permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree,
decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent,

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) otherwise delay or
impede the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Party
(or their respective Affiliates, as applicable) will be required, nor shall
any Acquired Corporation be permitted without Parents prior written consent,
to (i) undertake any efforts, or to take or consent to any action with respect
to, any business, assets, properties or operations of Parent or its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries following the
consummation of the Transactions) and (ii) agree to the payment of a "consent
fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration (including increased or

6.3 Company Stock Options, ESPP and EBC Option Agreement.

 

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the
Company Board or a committee thereof) that may be necessary (under the Company
Equity Plans and award agreements pursuant to which Company Options are
outstanding) to (i) cancel, extinguish and terminate for no consideration or
payment, effective as of and contingent upon the Effective Time, each Company
Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately before the

the Effective Time, (i) ensure that no new Offering (as defined in the ESPP)
shall be authorized or commenced on or after the date of this Agreement and
(ii) with respect to each Offering in existence under the ESPP on the date of
this Agreement, provide that no participant may increase his or her rate of
deferral and cause the last Business Day prior to the Offer Acceptance Time to
be treated as the last day of such Offering and the final Purchase Date (as
defined in the ESPP) of the then-current purchase period under such Offering
and use the ESPP participants accumulated contributions to purchase shares
under the ESPP on such date, and make such other pro-rata adjustments as may
be necessary to reflect the shortened Offering and shortened purchase period
but otherwise treat such shortened Offering and purchase period as fully
effective and completed for all purposes under the ESPP. The Company shall
terminate the ESPP in its entirety effective as of the Offer Acceptance Time,
contingent upon the Effective Time. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Company shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms

effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 6.3(b).

 

(c) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions
that may be necessary to cancel, extinguish and terminate the EBC Option

 the date of this Agreement) and as provided in the indemnification
agreements between each Acquired Corporation and said Indemnified Persons (as
set forth on Part 6.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and in effect as
of the date of this Agreement) in the forms made available by the Company to
Parent or Parents Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement, shall
survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such
Indemnified Persons, and shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to the fullest extent available under Delaware law for a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, and any claim made in
writing pursuant to such rights within such six (6)-year period shall continue
to be subject to this Section 6.5(a) and the rights provided under this
Section 6.5(a) until disposition of such claim.

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date
on which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (together with their successors and assigns, the "
_Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified
Person in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the Acquired
Corporations against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees,
expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified Person as an officer
or director of the Acquired Corporations in connection with any pending or
threatened Legal Proceeding based on or arising out of, in whole or in part,
the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of the
Acquired Corporations at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any
and all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including any such matter arising under any claim with respect
to the transactions contemplated herein. Without limiting the foregoing, from
the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, advance reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection
with matters for which such Indemnified Persons are eligible to be
indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.5(b) within 15 days after receipt by
Parent of a written request for such advance, subject to the execution by such
Indemnified Persons of appropriate undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying
Parties to repay such advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately
determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified
under this Section 6.5(b).

(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and Parent shall
cause Surviving Corporation to maintain, in effect, the existing policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Acquired
Corporations as of the date of this Agreement (accurate and complete copies of
which has been made available by the Company to Parent or
Parents Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement) for the benefit
of the Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by such existing policies
with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
in their capacities as directors and officers of the Acquired Corporations
(as applicable), on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no
less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policies (or at or prior to
the Effective Time Parent or the Acquired Corporations may (through a
nationally recognized insurance broker approved by Parent (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)) purchase a six (6)-year
"tail" policy for the existing policies effective as of the Effective Time)
and if such "tail policy" has been obtained, it shall be deemed to satisfy all
obligations to obtain and/or maintain insurance pursuant to this Section
6.5(c); _provided, however,_ that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation
be required to expend in any one (1) year an amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premium currently payable by the Acquired Corporations with respect to
such current policies, it being understood that if the annual premiums
payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall be
obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount; _provided_ , 
_further_ , _however_ , that the Acquired Corporations insurance broker as of
the date of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a nationally recognized
insurance broker.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving

 



39\.

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parents option,
Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall survive the acceptance of
Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger
and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and
(ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal Requirement, this Section 6.5
may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in
such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or
any of their successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of
the affected Indemnified Person.

 

6.5 Securityholder Litigation. Until the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Section 8, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of any
litigation brought or threatened against the Acquired Corporations and/or
their directors relating to the Transactions, including by providing copies of
all pleading with respect thereto, and thereafter keep Parent reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof (including by keeping Parent
apprised of proposed strategies and other decisions with respect to such
litigation contemplated by the Company). The Company shall give Parent the
right to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by
the Company in connection with such litigation, and the right to participate
in (but not control) the defense or settlement with respect to such
litigation, and the Company shall in good faith take such comments into
account. No such settlement or other resolution shall be agreed to without
Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except to the extent the settlement is fully covered
by the Companys insurance policies (other than any applicable deductible),
but only if such settlement solely provides for a monetary settlement and does
not result in the imposition of any restriction on the business or operations
of the Company or otherwise.

 

6.6 Additional Agreements. Without limitation or contravention of
the provisions of Section 6.2, and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the
Offer and the Merger and make effective the other Transactions, including (i)
making all filings (if any) and giving all notices (if any) required to be
made and given by such Party in connection with the Offer and the Merger and
the other Transactions, (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
each Consent (if any) required to be obtained pursuant to any applicable Legal
Requirement or Material Contract by such Party in connection with the
Transactions and (iii) using commercially reasonable efforts to lift any
restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Offer or the Merger brought by
any third Person against such Party. The Company shall promptly deliver to
Parent a copy of each such filing made, each such notice given and each such
Consent obtained by any Acquired Corporation during the Pre-Closing Period.

 

6.7 Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall
be a joint press release issued by, and whose form and content shall be agreed
to by, the Company and Parent and thereafter Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing any further press release(s) or
otherwise making any public statement or making any announcement to Company
Associates (to the extent disclosure of the content thereof was not previously
issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer,
the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not
issue any such press release, public statement or announcement to Company
Associates without the other Partys written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (a) each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any
public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors
or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to
employees and make disclosures in Company SEC Documents, so long as such
statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by
the other Party);

Associate pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by
the Transactions, the Company shall, subject to the provisions of any Labor
Agreement, provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication and Parent
and the Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable
communication; (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party
hereto but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party, issue any such
press release or make any such public announcement or statement required by
any Legal Requirement; (c) the Company need not consult with Parent
in connection with such portion of any press release, public statement or

Company Adverse Change Recommendation; and (d) each of CVC Advisors (U.S.)
Inc. and successors and their respective Affiliates and any stockholder of
the Company and their respective Affiliates and successors may disclose any
information with respect to the Transactions to their respective
Representatives, Affiliates, direct and indirect investors and financing
sources (including their respective Affiliates and Representatives) (so long
as, in each case, such disclosure has a valid business purpose and is effected
in a manner consistent with customary private equity practices).

6.8 Takeover Laws; Advice of Changes.

 

(a) If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to lawfully eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of
the Transactions.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent (and shall
subsequently keep the other informed on a current basis of any developments
related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence
of any fact, event or circumstance that (i) has had or would reasonably be
expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it and (ii)
is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in Section 7
or Annex I not being able to be satisfied prior to the End Date. Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company (and shall subsequently keep the other
informed on a current basis of any developments related to such notice) upon
its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or
circumstance that (i) has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) is reasonably likely to result in any
of the conditions set forth in Section 7 not being able to be satisfied prior
to the End Date. No such notification (or failure to provide
such notification) shall affect any of the representations, warranties,
covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the
Parties hereunder.

 

6.9 Section 16b-3 Matters. The Company shall take appropriate action to
approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the disposition

Options in the Transactions by applicable individuals and to cause such
dispositions and/or cancellations to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

 

6.10 Rule 14d-10 Matters. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time and to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the Compensation Committee
of the Company Board shall approve, as an "employment compensation, severance
or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, each agreement, arrangement or
understanding between the Company or any of its Affiliates and any of the
officers, directors or employees of the Company that are effective as of the

Exchange Act.

registered under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time and the Company shall prior to the Effective Time reasonably

6.13 Financing.

 

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, each of Parent and Purchaser shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things, in each case, within its
control, necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters (including the
"flex" provisions) ( _provided_ that Parent or Purchaser may replace or amend
the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement, or otherwise amend any
terms or conditions of the Debt Commitment Letters so long as the terms
thereof (x) would not reasonably be expected to make the funding of the
Debt Financing less likely to occur or materially delay or prevent the
Closing or (y) are not with respect to such portion of the Debt Financing that
is necessary to consummate the Transactions including to pay the aggregate
Offer Price and the Merger Consideration and the fees and expenses of Parent
related to the Transactions, and conditionality less beneficial to the Company
than those in the Debt Commitment Letters as in effect on the date of this
Agreement), including using its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters, (ii) to satisfy on a timely
basis, to the extent within its control, all terms and conditions applicable
to Parent to obtaining the Debt Financing set forth therein and (iii) to
enter into definitive agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Parent with respect thereto on the terms and conditions not less favorable
than those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (including the "flex"
provisions). In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on substantially the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letters (including the "flex " provisions), and such portion of
the Debt Financing is necessary to consummate the Transactions, including to
pay the aggregate Offer Price and the Merger Consideration and the fees and
expenses of Parent related to the Transactions, Parent shall as promptly
as reasonably practicable notify the Company and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain alternative debt financing from
alternative debt sources on financial terms no less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Parent than those terms set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters and upon other terms and conditions not materially less favorable, in
the aggregate, than those in the Debt Commitment Letters, in an aggregate
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby promptly
following the occurrence of such event, and in such event all references to
"Debt Financing" shall be deemed to reference such alternative debt financing.
Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all
agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed
to provide Parent with any portion of such alternative financing (except that
the fees and other commercially sensitive matters specified in any fee
letter may have been redacted, none of which redactions shall relate to the
amount, conditionality, enforceability or termination of such alternative
financing). The Company acknowledges and agrees that that the failure by
Parent or Purchaser to obtain the Debt Financing following compliance with
this Section 6.13 will not, in and of itself, be considered a breach of this
Agreement for any purpose. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon
having knowledge of any actual or potential material breach by any party to
any of the Commitment Letters or any actual or potential termination of any of
the Commitment Letters.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of
their respective Representatives to, as applicable, provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser in connection with the Debt
Financing or any permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative
financing for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (provided that
such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company), including using their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such Representatives (A) to be available on a
customary basis to meet with prospective lenders, rating agencies and
investors in presentations, meetings, road shows and due diligence sessions
and reasonably cooperate with the marketing efforts of Parent and Purchaser
and the Debt Financing Sources for any such Debt Financing, (B) to

 assist with the preparation of disclosure documents, offering documents,
private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, rating agency
presentations, projections and similar documents in connection therewith
(including the Company timely executing and delivering one or more customary
authorization and representation letters that are customary in the Debt
Financing), (C) to furnish Parent, Purchaser and the Debt Financing
Sources with financial statements and financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested by Parent or Purchaser to consummate the financings contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters, (D) facilitating the execution and delivery of
any definitive financing documentation, security documents, hedging
arrangements, customary certificates or other documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent or Purchaser in connection with the Debt Financing, in
each case which will become effective only on or after the Effective Time, (E)
to take such reasonable actions as may be required to facilitate the pledge of
collateral to secure the Debt Financing (including cooperation in connection
with the pay-off of the Existing Credit Facilities and the release of
Encumbrances related thereto), (F) to promptly provide Parent and Purchaser

accordance with this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that a Party shall not
be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) if

a breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
failure to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of

9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any

delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be

and the other agreements and schedules referred to herein constitute the
entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among or between any of the Parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof; _provided, however,_ that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded and shall remain in full
force and effect; _provided, further, that,_ if the Effective Time occurs, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further
force and effect. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and
the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in
counterparts or otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance;
Remedies. 

(a) Subject to Section 9.5(e), this Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless

any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (i) each of the Parties
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any
state appellate court therefrom or, if such court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle County in
the State of Delaware (it being agreed that the consents to jurisdiction and
venue set forth in this Section 9.5(a) shall not constitute general consents
to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for
any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to
confer rights on any Person other than the Parties hereto);

 



48\.

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process by
first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the
address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with Section
9.8. The Parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal
Requirements; _provided, however,_ that nothing in the foregoing shall
restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any
appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions
of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 9.5(a) without proof
of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity, (ii) the election to pursue an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, subject in all
respects to this Section 9.5, will not restrict, impair or otherwise limit
Parent, Purchaser or the Company from, in the alternative and as applicable,
seeking to terminate the Agreement and collect the Parent Termination Fee or
the Termination Fee, as applicable, pursuant to Section 8.3(b); _provided,_
_however,_ that in no event will such Persons be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief or any other remedies under this Agreement or available at
law or equity, on the one hand, and payment of any monetary damages whatsoever
or the payment of all or a portion of the Parent Termination Fee or the
Termination Fee, as applicable, on the other hand, and (iii) the right of
specific performance and other agreements in this Section 9.5 are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger) and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties hereto have an adequate
remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or equity. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.5(b) shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Equity Commitment
Letters, the Limited Guarantee or the Debt Commitment Letters to the contrary,
it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to
enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents obligation to cause all or
any portion of the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement
or the Equity Commitment Letters) or otherwise cause Parent or Purchaser
to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement only if: (1) the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 have been and continue to be satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing but which
are then capable of being satisfied at the Closing) at the time when the
consummation of the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.3(a)
but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded; (2) the Debt
Financing is available to be funded at the Closing and has been funded or will
be funded if the Equity Financing is funded; (3) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed to Parent in writing that if specific performance is granted and
the Debt Financing and Equity Financing are funded, then it will take such
actions within its control to cause the Transactions to be consummated and (4)
Parent and Purchaser have failed to consummate the Merger by the date the
Merger is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.3(a).

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY (INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIM AGAINST ANY DEBT
FINANCING SOURCE OR ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THE DEBT
FINANCING, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTERS AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY) IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Source) as collateral security for their obligations under any of their

Subsidiary of Purchaser or any of their Affiliates ( _provided,_ that such

directors are present, or if notice is waived in writing, either before or
after the meeting, by those not present. Participation of one or more

Section 3. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may, in its discretion, by
resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, designate
from among its members one or more committees which shall consist of one or
more directors. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as

disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. Such committees shall
have and may exercise such powers as shall be conferred or authorized by the
resolution appointing them. A majority of any such committee may
determine its action and fix the time and place of its meetings, unless the
Board of Directors shall otherwise provide. The Board of Directors shall have

vacancies in it, or to dissolve it.

Section 4. _Action by Consent_. Any action required or permitted to be

ARTICLE IV

_INDEMNIFICATION _

Section 1. _Directors and Officers_. The Corporation shall indemnify its
directors and officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (" _DGCL_ ") or any other applicable
law; provided, however, that the Corporation may modify the extent of such
indemnification by individual contracts with its directors and officers; and,
provided, further, that the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify any
director or officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person unless (i) such indemnification is expressly
required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, (iii) such indemnification is provided by the
Corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the
Corporation under the DGCL or any other applicable law or (iv) such
indemnification is required to be made under Section 4 of this Article IV.

 

Section 2. _Employees and other Agents_. The Corporation shall have power
to indemnify its employees and other agents as set forth in the DGCL or any
other applicable law. The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate
the determination of whether indemnification shall be given to any such person
as the Board of Directors shall determine.

 

Section 3. _Expenses_. The Corporation shall advance to any person who was
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a
director or officer, of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final
disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all
expenses incurred by any director or officer in connection with such
proceeding, provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of
expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of
an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such
indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to
appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Article IV or
otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant
to Section 5 of this Article IV, no advance shall be made by the Corporation
to an officer of the Corporation (except by reason of the fact that such
officer is or was a director of the Corporation in which event

 



C-6

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 this sentence shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is
reasonably and promptly made (i) by a majority vote of directors who were not
parties to the proceeding, even if not a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of
such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though
less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or such
directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that
the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is
made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith
or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation.

 

Section 4. _Enforcement_. Without the necessity of entering into an
express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and
officers under this Article IV shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be
effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the
Corporation and the director or officer. Any right to indemnification or
advances granted by this Article IV to a director or officer shall be
enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of
competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is
denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made
within ninety (90) days of request therefor. To the extent permitted by law,
the claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in
part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim.
In connection with any claim for indemnification, the Corporation shall be
entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not
met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL or any
other applicable law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the
amount claimed. In connection with any claim by an officer of the Corporation
(except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such officer is or
was a director of the Corporation) for advances, the Corporation shall be
entitled to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing
evidence that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person
did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such
person acted without reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was
lawful. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification
of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable
law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant
has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable
standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or officer to enforce
a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the
burden of proving that the director or officer is not entitled to be
indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article IV or
otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

Section 5. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person
by this Article IV shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person
may have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The
Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts
with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting
indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL
or any other applicable law.

 

Section 6. _Survival of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by
this Article IV shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of
the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

 

Section 7. _Insurance_. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any
other applicable law, the Corporation, upon approval by the Board of
Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or
permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Article IV.

Section 8. _Amendments_. Any repeal or modification of this Article IV
shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Article
IV in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission
to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the
Corporation. 

Section 9. _Saving Clause_.

 

If this Article IV or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by
any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless
indemnify each director and officer to the full extent not prohibited by any
applicable portion of this Article IV that shall not have been invalidated, or
by any other applicable law. If this Article IV shall be invalid due to
the application of the indemnification provisions of another jurisdiction,
then the Corporation shall indemnify each director and executive officer to
the full extent under any other applicable law.

 

Section 10. _Certain Definitions_.

 

For the purposes of this Article IV, the following definitions shall apply:

 

(1) The term "proceeding" shall be broadly construed and shall include,
without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution, defense,
settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of testimony in, any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,

(2) The term "expenses" shall be broadly construed and shall include, without
limitation, court costs, attorneys fees, witness fees, fines, amounts paid
in settlement or judgment and any other costs and expenses of any nature or
kind incurred in connection with any proceeding.

 

(3) The term the "corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the
provisions of this Article IV with respect to the resulting or surviving
corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if
its separate existence had continued.

 

(4) References to a "director," "executive officer," "officer," "employee," or
"agent" of the corporation shall include, without limitation, situations
where such person is serving at the request of the corporation as,
respectively, a director, executive officer, officer, employee, trustee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise.

(5) References to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit
plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a
person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at
the request of the corporation" shall include any service as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or
involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect
to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person
who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the corporation" as referred to in this section.

resolution prescribe. Where any such certificate is countersigned by
a transfer agent other than the Corporation or its employee, or registered by
a registrar other than the Corporation or its employee, the signature of any
such officer may be a facsimile signature. In case any officer or officers who

or officers of the Corporation, whether because of death, resignation or
otherwise, before such certificate or certificates shall have been delivered
by the Corporation, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be
adopted by the Corporation and be issued and delivered as though the person or
persons who signed such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile
signature or signatures shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such

transferred only upon the books of the Corporation by the holder thereof in

of the authenticity of the signature as the Corporation or its agents may
reasonably require.

date, not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days preceding the date
of any meeting of Stockholders, or the date for the payment of any dividend,

any change, conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into effect, as
a record date for the determination of the Stockholders entitled to notice of,
and to vote at, any such meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any such
dividend, or to receive any distribution or allotment of such rights, or to
exercise the rights in respect of any such change, conversion or exchange of
capital stock, and in such case only such Stockholders as shall be
Stockholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to such notice
of, and to vote at, such meeting, or to receive payment of such dividend, or
to receive such distribution or allotment or rights or to exercise such
rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the
books of the Corporation after any such record date fixed as aforesaid.

Section 4. _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any certificate of
stock is lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated, the Board of Directors may
authorize the issuance of a new certificate of the same tenor and for the same
number of shares in lieu thereof. The Board of Directors may in its
discretion, before the issuance of such new certificate, require the owner of
the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate, or the legal

The foregoing conditions (including the Minimum Condition) are for the sole
benefit of Parent and Purchaser and, subject to applicable Legal Requirements,
may be waived by Parent or Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time in their sole discretion (except for the Minimum Condition,
which may not be waived), in each case subject to the terms of the Agreement.
Any reference in this _Annex I_ or the Agreement to a condition or requirement
being satisfied shall be deemed to be satisfied if such condition or
requirement is so waived. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to,
and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and Purchaser to extend,
terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Agreement. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and
each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any
time and from time to time.
