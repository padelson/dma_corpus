assign, convey, transfer and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to
acquire from the Company and each applicable Seller Subsidiary, all right,
title and interest in and to the following assets and equity interests

1.1(a)(i) (the "Acquired Subsidiary Equity Interests"), which equity interests
represent all of the outstanding equity interests of the Acquired Subsidiaries
except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 1.1(a)(i);

  

  

(ii) the equity interests of the Investment Subsidiaries listed on Schedule

thereof (i.e., the Estimated Cash Adjustment, the estimated Agreed Capital
Expenditures and the Estimated Cash Flow Adjustment). The Estimated Closing
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied using the same
accounting methods, practices and principles used in the preparation of the
Audited Financial Statements to the extent consistent with GAAP.

  

  

(b) Post-Closing Date Purchase Price Adjustments. Within forty-five (45) days
after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the
Company a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth Purchaser's
calculation of Purchased Cash and

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

in reasonable detail demonstrating each component thereof (i.e., Purchaser's
calculation of the Cash Adjustment, Purchaser's calculation of the Agreed
Capital Expenditures and Purchaser's calculation of the Cash Flow Adjustment).
The Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied using
the same accounting methods, practices and principles used in the preparation
of the Audited Financial Statements to the extent consistent with GAAP. Each
of the Company and Purchaser shall, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries and representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation
of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the final Agreed Capital
Expenditures, the final Cash Flow Adjustment, and the Final Cash Adjustment
and, if applicable, in the conduct of any dispute resolution process pursuant
to Section 1.4(c), including making available, to the extent necessary, books,
records, work papers and appropriate personnel.

  

  

(c) Dispute Resolution Procedures.

  

  

(i) If the Company disagrees with Purchaser's calculation of Purchased Cash as
set forth in the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section 1.4(b), the
Company may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement,
deliver a notice to Purchaser providing reasonable detail of the reasons for
such disagreement and setting forth the Company's calculation of the items and
amounts in dispute. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify all items or
amounts as to which the Company disagrees, and the Company shall be deemed to
have agreed with all other items and amounts, and the calculation thereof, set
forth in the Closing Statement.

  

  

(ii) If a notice of disagreement shall be properly delivered pursuant to
Section 1.4(c)(i), the Company and Purchaser shall, during the fifteen (15)
days following such delivery, negotiate in good faith to reach written
agreement on the disputed items or amounts. The matters set forth in any
written resolution executed by the Company and Purchaser shall be final and
binding on the parties on the date of such written resolution.

  

  

(iii) If the Company and Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement during
such fifteen (15) day period, they shall promptly thereafter submit the
dispute to the Arbitrating Accountant for resolution. The Arbitrating
Accountant shall determine (it being understood that in making such
determination, the Arbitrating Accountant shall be functioning as an expert
and not as an arbitrator), based solely on written submissions by Purchaser
and the Company, and not by independent review, only those items or amounts in
dispute and shall deliver to the Company and Purchaser, as promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than thirty (30) days from the date of
engagement of the Arbitrating Accountant), a written report as to the
resolution of the dispute and the resulting computation of the Final Purchased
Cash. Such report shall be final and binding on the parties and shall not be
subject to further review or appeal (absent manifest arithmetical error). In
resolving any disputed item, the Arbitrating Accountant (x) shall be bound by
the provisions of this Section 1.4 and (y) may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The fees, costs
and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountant shall be allocated to and borne by
Purchaser and the Company based on the inverse of the percentage that the
Arbitrating Accountant's determination (before such allocation) bears to the
total amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the
Arbitrating Accountant. For example, should the items in dispute total in
amount to $1,000 and the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Arbitrating Accountant awards $600 in favor of the Company's position, sixty
percent (60%) of the costs of its review would be borne by Purchaser and forty
percent (40%) of the costs would be borne by the Company.

  

  

(iv) The Closing Statement shall become the "Final Closing Statement" (A) on
the thirty-first (31st) day following the delivery of the Closing Statement if
a notice of disagreement has not been delivered to Purchaser by the Company,
(B) with such changes as are necessary to reflect matters resolved pursuant to
any written resolution executed pursuant to Section 1.4(c)(ii), on the date
such resolution is executed, if all outstanding matters are resolved through
such resolution or (C) with such changes as are necessary to reflect the
Arbitrating Accountant's resolution of the matters in dispute (together with
any changes necessary to reflect matters previously resolved pursuant to any
written resolution executed pursuant to Section 1.4(c)(ii), and any matters
not disputed pursuant to a notice of disagreement), on the date the
Arbitrating Accountant delivers its final, binding resolution pursuant to
Section 1.4(c)(iii).

  

  

(d) Net Adjustment Amount. Upon final determination of the Final Purchased
Cash as provided in Section 1.4(c):

  

  

(i) if the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, Purchaser shall promptly deliver
to the Company the Net Adjustment Amount.

  

  

(ii) if the Net Adjustment Amount is negative, the Company shall promptly
deliver to Purchaser the absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount.

  

  

(iii) any payment pursuant to this Section 1.4(d) shall be made by Purchaser
or the Company, as the case may be, as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than five Business Days following the determination of the Final
Purchased Cash as provided in Section 1.4(c), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account of the other party as may be designated in
writing by such other party.

  

  

(e) BRP Leasing. For the avoidance of doubt, BRP Leasing shall not be
considered in evaluating whether the financial information or calculations
delivered under Section 1.4 have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
using the same accounting methods, practices and principles used in
preparation of the Audited Financial Statements.

  

  

Section 1.5 Allocation.

  

  

(a) The Company and Purchaser agree that the gross purchase price, as
represented by the sum of the Closing Consideration, the Second Closing
Consideration and other appropriately capitalized amounts (the "Allocable
Consideration"), shall be allocated among the Assets and Equity Interests in a
reasonable manner and consistent with applicable Law.

  

  

(b) The Parties shall agree, prior to the Closing, to an initial allocation of
the Allocable Consideration (based on the fair market value of the Allocable
Consideration as determined as of the date of this Agreement) among the Assets
and Equity Interests (the "Allocation"). As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall submit a proposed

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

final Allocation to the Company to reflect any post-closing adjustments solely
to the extent there are any changes in the composition or value of the assets
as reflected in the Allocation as of the Closing Date. The Company shall
thereupon have thirty (30) days to review the proposed final Allocation and to
notify Purchaser of any aspects of the proposed final Allocation with which it
disagrees. In the event of any such disagreement, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve such disagreement. Should the Parties fail to resolve
any disagreement within thirty (30) days after the Company notifies Purchaser
that the Company disagrees with any aspect of the preliminary Allocation, a
determination regarding the disputed item(s) shall be made by the Arbitrating
Accountant, whose decision shall be final and whose fees shall be shared
equally by the Company and Purchaser. The Allocation shall be further adjusted
as appropriate in accordance with the principles and procedures in this
Section 1.5 to reflect any additional adjustments in the gross purchase price,
as so determined, made following the Closing Date in accordance with this
Agreement.

  

  

(c) The Company and Purchaser agree to file all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with this Section 1.5 and the Allocation and will not, in
connection with the filing of such Tax Returns, make any allocation for Tax
purposes that is contrary to the Allocation unless required to do so by
applicable Law and after prior written notice thereof to the other such Party.
The Company and Purchaser agree to consult with each other with respect to all
issues related to the Allocation in connection with any Tax audits,
controversies, or litigation.

the Seller or any of its ERISA Affiliates of any action under ERISA §4042 with
respect to any Defined Benefit Plan, and Seller does not reasonably expect the
PBGC to take any such action. As of the most recent valuation date, the amount
of unfunded benefit liabilities (as such term is defined in ERISA
§4001(a)(18)) for each of the Defined Benefit Plans maintained by Seller or
any of its ERISA Affiliates is set forth in Section 3.18(c) of the Company

Section 4.1 Organization. Purchaser is a corporation duly incorporated or
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware. Purchaser is qualified to conduct business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation under the Laws of each jurisdiction where
the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to be materially adverse to Purchaser.

  

  

Section 4.2 Power and Authority. Purchaser has all necessary corporate power
and authority (a) to conduct its business as currently conducted and (b) to
enter into and perform this Agreement and all other Transaction Documents to
be executed by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the

of the Transaction Documents have been duly authorized by all requisite
corporate action in accordance with applicable Law and Purchaser's Governing
Documents.

  

  

Section 4.3 Enforceability. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Purchaser and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
of the Selling Parties, constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of
Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except
as enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions. Upon
execution and delivery by Purchaser, the other Purchaser Documents will have
been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery of the Selling Parties, will constitute, valid and
legally binding obligations of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in
accordance with their respective terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions.

  

  

Section 4.4 Consents. Except for compliance with, and filings under, the

Documents does not and Purchaser's consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions will not conflict with or result in a breach of (a) any provision
of Purchaser's Governing Documents or (b) any Law or Order to which Purchaser
is party or by which Purchaser is bound. Purchaser is not a party to or bound
by any Contract under which (i) Purchaser's execution and delivery of or
performance under the Purchaser Documents or consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions will constitute a default, breach or event of acceleration, or
(ii) performance by Purchaser according to the terms of the Purchaser
Documents may be prohibited, prevented or delayed.

  

  

Section 4.6 Capitalization.

  

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of Purchaser consists of: (i) 3,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which zero shares

its capital stock or any other securities.

  

  

Section 4.7 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

  

  

(a) Since January 1, 2011, Purchaser has filed or furnished on a timely basis
all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including
exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required to be filed
or furnished by Purchaser with the SEC (the "Purchaser SEC Documents"). As of
their respective dates, the Purchaser SEC Documents

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Purchaser
SEC Documents and, except to the extent that information contained in such
Purchaser SEC Document has been revised, amended, modified or superseded
(prior to the date of this Agreement) by a later filed Purchaser SEC Document,
none of the Purchaser SEC Documents when filed or furnished contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

  

  

(b) The financial statements (including any related notes and schedules)
contained or incorporated by reference in the Purchaser SEC Documents (the
"Purchaser Financial Statements"): (i) complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable
thereto; (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods covered (except as may be indicated in the notes
to such financial statements or as permitted by Regulation S-X, or, in the
case of unaudited financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or
any successor form under the Exchange Act); and (iii) fairly present, in all
material respects, the financial position of Purchaser as of the respective
dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of Purchaser for
the periods covered thereby (subject, in the case of the unaudited financial
statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments described therein,
that are not, individually or in the aggregate, material).

maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Purchaser;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of Purchaser; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of Purchaser that could have a
material effect on the Purchaser Financial Statements. Purchaser has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) reasonably designed to
provide reasonable assurance that all material information required to be
disclosed by Purchaser in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Purchaser's management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since December 31, 2011, neither Purchaser nor Purchaser's
independent registered accountant has identified or been made aware of: (A)
any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting utilized by Purchaser; (B) any
illegal act or fraud, whether or not material, that involves Purchaser or its
management or other employees; or (C) any claim or

assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the Closing
Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to Purchaser.

with all Environmental Laws and Environment Permits applicable to Purchaser's
business and Purchaser is not subject to any pending or, the Knowledge of

date before or on the End Date), (iv) if there shall have occurred any

then, for so long as such contest or defense continues, each Party will, at
the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless the

(b) The Company shall be responsible for, and shall pay to the City of New
York (or to the ground lessee under the New York Ground Leases for payment to
the City of New York), at or prior to the Closing, the full amount of the

the aggregate amount of the Proceeds Payments not in dispute and (ii) shall at
or prior to the Closing, either pay to Depository (as such term is defined in

irrevocably commit to take the actions set forth in clauses (i)(x) or (y), in
each case, within ten (10) Business Days of receiving the Excess Proceeds

Section 7.5 Non-Solicitation; Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) The Company agrees that, during the period beginning on the Closing Date
and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, it shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, contact, approach or solicit for the
purpose of offering employment to or hiring (whether as an employee,
consultant, agent, independent contractor or otherwise) or hire any person
employed by any of the Purchased Business Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall (and shall
cause each of its Affiliates to) treat and hold as confidential any
information concerning any of the Purchased Business Subsidiaries and/or the
Purchased Business that is not already generally available to the public,
including any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, forecasts,
interpretations or other documents that are derived from, contain, reflect or
are based upon any such information (the "Purchaser Confidential
Information"), refrain from using any of the Purchaser Confidential
Information except in connection with the performance of their obligations
under this Agreement, and deliver promptly to Purchaser, at the request and
option of Purchaser, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the
Purchaser Confidential Information which are in its possession or under its
control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser Confidential Information
shall not include information that is (i) generally available to the public
other than as a result of a breach of this Section 7.5(b), (ii) independently
developed without use of or reference to the Purchaser Confidential
Information, or (iii) rightfully received after the Closing Date from a Third
Party not under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to such
information. In the event that the Company or any of its Affiliates is
requested or required (by oral question or request for information or
documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any Purchaser
Confidential Information, such Person shall notify Purchaser promptly of the
request or requirement so that Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective
order or waive compliance with the provisions of

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

this Section 7.5(b). If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt
of a waiver hereunder, the Company or any of its Affiliates is, on the advice
of counsel, compelled to disclose any Purchaser Confidential Information to
any tribunal, such Person may disclose the Purchaser Confidential Information
to the tribunal; provided, that such disclosing Person shall use its
reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request and at the expense of Purchaser,
an order or other assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to
such portion of the Purchaser Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as Purchaser shall designate.

  

  

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and shall
cause each of its Affiliates to) treat and hold as confidential any
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is not already
generally available to the public, including any notes, analyses,
compilations, studies, forecasts, interpretations or other documents that are
derived from, contain, reflect or are based upon any such information (the
"Company Confidential Information"), refrain from using any of the Company
Confidential Information except in connection with the performance of their
obligations under this Agreement, and deliver promptly to the Company, at the
request and option of the Company, all tangible embodiments (and all copies)
of the Company Confidential Information which are in its possession or under
its control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Confidential
Information shall not include information that is (i) generally available to
the public other than as a result of a breach of this Section 7.5(c), (ii)
independently developed without use of or reference to the Company
Confidential Information, or (iii) rightfully received after the Closing Date
from a Third Party not under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to
such information. In the event that Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is
requested or required (by oral question or request for information or
documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any Company Confidential
Information, such Person shall notify the Company promptly of the request or
requirement so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order or
waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 7.5(c). If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose
any Company Confidential Information to any tribunal, such Person may disclose
the Company Confidential Information to the tribunal; provided, that such
disclosing Person shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request
and at the expense of the Company, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment shall be accorded to such portion of the Company
Confidential Information required to be disclosed as the Company shall
designate.

  

  

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach by it (or
any of its Affiliates) of any of the provisions of this Section 7.5, monetary
damages shall not constitute a sufficient remedy. Consequently, in the event
of any such breach, the non-breaching party and/or its successors or assigns
may, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply
to any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific
performance and/or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce or prevent
any violations of the provisions hereof, in each case without the requirement
of posting a bond or proving actual damages. Each Party shall be responsible
for any breach of this Section 7.5 by any of its Affiliates.

ARTICLE VIII

  

TAX MATTERS

  

  

Section 8.1 Tax Returns.

  

  

(a) The Company, at its sole expense, shall cause to be prepared (and filed to
the extent due before the Closing) the Tax Returns required to be filed by
each Purchased Business Subsidiary (other than any Investment Subsidiary or
any Subsidiary of any Investment Subsidiary in which the Company directly or
indirectly owns less than 50% of the outstanding equity and/or partnership
interests) (the "Purchased Business Subsidiary Tax Returns") for taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date. Each such Purchased Business
Subsidiary Tax Return shall be prepared in accordance with existing
procedures, practices and accounting methods of the Company and such Purchased
Business Subsidiary with respect to the treatment of specific items on income
Tax Returns, unless such treatment does not have sufficient legal support to
avoid the imposition of penalties, fines or similar amounts. The Company shall
deliver a draft of each such Purchased Business Subsidiary Tax Return to be
filed after the Closing Date to Purchaser not fewer than thirty (30) days
prior to the deadline for filing such Tax Return, including extensions.
Purchaser shall notify the Company in writing if it objects to any portion of
the draft Purchased Business Subsidiary Tax Returns within ten (10) days after
the draft Purchased Business Subsidiary Tax Return is delivered to Purchaser.
If the Company does not receive written objection by the end of the ten (10)
day period, the Company shall deliver a final copy of the Tax Return to
Purchaser for execution and filing and Purchaser shall cause the Tax Return to
be timely executed and filed. If Purchaser notifies the Company that it
objects to any portion of the draft Purchased Business Subsidiary Tax Returns
on or before the end of the ten (10) days as a result of the Tax Return
failing to satisfy the requirements described above, Purchaser and the Company
shall attempt to mutually resolve any disagreements in good faith regarding
such draft Purchased Business Subsidiary Tax Return. Any such disagreements
regarding the draft Purchased Business Subsidiary Tax Returns that are not
resolved within another ten (10) days by the parties shall be resolved by a
mutually agreed upon and jointly engaged Arbitrating Accountant, whose
decision shall be final and whose fees shall be shared equally by the Company
and Purchaser. The Purchased Business Subsidiary Tax Returns that are subject
to any disagreement shall not be filed until such disagreement is resolved,
provided that if such Purchased Business Subsidiary Tax Returns must be filed
in order to avoid a penalty, such Purchased Business Subsidiary Tax Returns
may be filed as prepared (with any changes to which the parties agree prior to
the date of filing reflected therein), and if further changes are agreed upon
or required by the Arbitrating Accountant then the Company shall amend such
Purchased Business Subsidiary Tax Returns promptly to reflect such changes.
The Company shall deliver final copies of such Tax Returns to Purchaser for
execution and filing, and Purchaser shall cause such Tax Returns to be timely
executed and filed.

  

  

(b) Purchaser, at its sole expense, shall cause to be prepared and filed the
Tax Returns required to be filed by each Purchased Business Subsidiary for
taxable periods that include, but do not end on, the Closing Date ("Straddle
Period Tax Returns"). Each such Straddle Period Tax Return shall be prepared
in accordance with existing procedures, practices and accounting methods of
the Company and such Purchased Business Subsidiary with respect to the
treatment of specific items on income Tax Returns, unless such treatment does
not have sufficient legal support to avoid the imposition of penalties, fines
or similar amounts. Purchaser

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

shall deliver a draft of each such Straddle Period Tax Return to the Company
not fewer than thirty (30) days prior to the deadline for filing such Tax
Return, including extensions. The Company shall notify Purchaser in writing if
it objects to any portion of the draft Straddle Period Tax Returns within ten
(10) days after the draft Straddle Period Tax Return is delivered to the
Company. If Purchaser does not receive written objection by the end of the ten
(10) day period, Purchaser shall cause the Tax Return to be timely executed
and filed. If the Company notifies Purchaser that it objects to any portion of
the draft Straddle Period Tax Returns on or before the end of the ten (10)
days, Purchaser and the Company shall attempt to mutually resolve any
disagreements in good faith regarding such draft Straddle Period Tax Return.
Any disagreements regarding the draft Straddle Period Tax Returns that are not
resolved within another ten (10) days by the parties shall be resolved by a
mutually agreed upon and jointly engaged Arbitrating Accountant, whose
decision shall be final and whose fees shall be shared equally by the Company
and Purchaser. The Straddle Period Tax Returns that are subject to any
disagreement shall not be filed until such disagreement is resolved, provided
that if such Straddle Period Tax Returns must be filed in order to avoid a
penalty, such Straddle Period Tax Returns may be filed as prepared (with any
changes to which the parties agree prior to the date of filing reflected
therein), and if further changes are agreed upon or required by the
Arbitrating Accountant then Purchaser shall amend such Straddle Period Tax
Returns promptly to reflect such changes.

  

  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 8.1 shall not apply to any Tax
Return that includes a Purchased Business Subsidiary that is filed on a
consolidated, combined, unitary or other group basis with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than a Purchased Business Subsidiary).

  

  

Section 8.2 Liability for Taxes. Promptly upon written demand upon the Company
from Purchaser, the Company shall reimburse Purchaser or any Purchased
Business Subsidiary for all Taxes of such Purchased Business Subsidiary (other
than any Investment Subsidiary and any Subsidiary of any Investment Subsidiary
in which the Company directly or indirectly owns less than 50% of the
outstanding equity and/or partnership interests) for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and all Taxes of such Purchased Business Subsidiary that are
apportioned under Section 8.3 to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period (as defined
below) for any Tax period that begins on or before the Closing Date and ends
after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"); provided, that with respect to
any Purchased Business Subsidiary in which the Company directly or indirectly
owns less than 100% of the outstanding equity and/or partnership interests,
such reimbursement shall be limited to the percentage of the Tax equal to the
Company's direct and indirect percentage equity and/or partnership interest in
the Purchased Business Subsidiary; provided, further, that the Company shall
have no obligation to reimburse Purchaser or any Purchased Business Subsidiary
for any Taxes taken into account in computing the Closing Statement. Any
amounts paid by the Company to Purchaser or such Purchased Business Subsidiary
under this Section 8.2 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Closing
Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Law.

  

  

Section 8.3 Apportionment of Straddle Period Taxes. With respect to any
Straddle Period, the Taxes of any Purchased Business Subsidiary or otherwise
imposed on or in connection with any Purchased Assets and Equity Interests and
Delayed Equity Interests, if any, attributable to such Straddle Period shall
be apportioned between the portion of the Straddle Period that begins on the
first day of the Straddle

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Period and ends on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Straddle Period"), and
the portion of the Straddle Period that begins on the day immediately
following the Closing Date and ends on the last day of the Straddle Period
(the "Post-Closing Straddle Period"). In the case of income Taxes, sales and
use Taxes, and Taxes based on gross or net receipts or payments, the portion
of the Tax allocated to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall equal the amount
that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on the last day of the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period by means of closing the books and records of such
Purchased Business Subsidiary as of the last day of the Pre-Closing Straddle
Period, provided that all permitted allowances, exemptions and deductions that
are normally computed on the basis of an entire year or period (such as
depreciation and amortization deductions) shall accrue on a daily basis and
shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the Post-
Closing Straddle Period in proportion to the number of days in each such
period. In the case of Taxes not described in the immediately preceding
sentence, the portion of the Tax allocated to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period
shall equal the amount of Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by the
ratio of the number of days during the Pre-Closing Straddle Period to the
number of days during the entire Straddle Period.

  

  

Section 8.4 Cooperation; Audits. In connection with the preparation of Tax
Returns, audit examinations, and any administrative or judicial proceedings
relating to the Taxes imposed on any Purchased Business Subsidiary or the
Purchased Business for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall cooperate fully with each
other, including furnishing or making available during normal business hours
records, personnel (as reasonably required), books of account, powers of
attorney or other materials necessary or helpful for the preparation of such
Tax Returns, the conduct of audit examinations or the defense of claims by
Governmental Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes. Purchaser shall
provide the Company, and the Company shall provide Purchaser, with the
information that each is respectively required to report under Code §§ 6043A.

  

  

Section 8.5 Tax Contests.

  

  

(a) If any Governmental Authority issues to any Purchased Business Subsidiary
(i) a written notice of its intent to audit, examine or conduct another
proceeding with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of such Purchased Business
Subsidiary or otherwise imposed on the Purchased Business for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or (ii) a written notice of deficiency, written notice of
reassessment, written proposed adjustment, written assertion of claim or
written demand concerning Taxes or Tax Returns of such Purchased Business
Subsidiary or otherwise imposed on the Purchased Business for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period (each, a "Tax Claim"), Purchaser or such Purchased Business
Subsidiary shall notify the Company in writing of the receipt of such
communication from the Governmental Authority within fifteen (15) days after
receiving such Tax Claim. No failure or delay of Purchaser or such Purchased
Business Subsidiary in the performance of the foregoing shall reduce or
otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of the Company under this
Agreement, except to the extent that such failure precludes or otherwise
prejudices the Company from defending against any liability or claim for Taxes
that the Company is obligated to pay hereunder.

  

  

(b) The Company shall control any proceeding relating to any Tax Claim with
respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of any Purchased Business Subsidiary or
otherwise imposed on

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the Purchased Business to the extent it relates to Taxes or a Tax Return for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period (a "Tax Contest"); provided that (i) Purchaser shall
have the right to participate in any such Tax Contest and the Company shall
provide Purchaser with copies of all written communications relating to the
Tax Contest, (ii) the Company shall keep Purchaser informed regarding the
progress of any Tax Contest and consult with Purchaser with respect to any
issue relating to such Tax Contest that could have a materially adverse effect
on the Purchased Business Subsidiaries, and (iii) the Company shall not settle
or otherwise resolve any Tax Contest (or any issue raised in any Tax Contest)
if such settlement or other resolution would materially adversely affect Taxes
for which the Company is not liable under this Agreement without the
permission of Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Purchaser shall timely provide (or cause to be provided) to the
Company powers of attorney in order to permit the Company to exercise its
rights to control any such Tax Contests. For the avoidance of doubt, this
Section 8.5(b) shall not apply to any Taxes or Tax Return with respect to a
Purchased Business Subsidiary that is paid or filed on a consolidated,
combined, unitary or other group basis with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than a Purchased Business Subsidiary).

  

  

(c) If there is an adjustment to any Tax Return pursuant to this Section 8.5
that creates a deficiency in any Taxes for which the Company is liable under
this Agreement, the Company shall promptly pay to Purchaser the amount of such
deficiency in Taxes after written demand for payment.

  

  

Section 8.6 Amended Tax Returns. The Company shall not file or cause or permit
to be filed any amended Tax Returns that may affect the Tax liability of
Purchaser, the Purchased Business Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the
foregoing for any Post-Closing Tax Period, including any Post-Closing Straddle
Period, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent may not
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. Purchaser shall not file or
cause to be filed any amended Tax Returns covering any period or adjusting any
Taxes for a period that includes any period prior to the Closing Date without
the prior written consent of the Company, which consent may not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. The Company shall cooperate
with Purchaser in obtaining Tax refunds, including through the filing of
amended Tax Returns or refund claims. Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid
to the Company any refunds or credits received by Purchaser or any Purchased
Business Subsidiary (or to which any of them are entitled) of any Taxes of any
Purchased Business Subsidiary attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any
such payment by Purchaser shall be reduced by the amount of any increase in
Taxes of any Purchased Business Subsidiary, Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates that arises from the same adjustment resulting in the
applicable Tax refund.

  

  

Section 8.7 Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax allocation, Tax sharing, Tax
indemnity or similar agreements between the Company or any of its Affiliates,
on the one hand, and any Purchased Business Subsidiary on the other hand,
shall be terminated with respect to such Purchased Business Subsidiary prior
to the Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any
of its Affiliates, on the one hand, nor any Purchased Business Subsidiary on
the other hand, shall be bound thereby or have any further Liability or
obligation thereunder to the other party with respect to periods prior to the
Closing Date except as provided in this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

  

INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

Section 9.1 Indemnification Obligations of the Company. Notwithstanding the
Closing, the Company and each of the Seller Subsidiaries, jointly and
severally, covenant and agree to indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries, successors and permitted assigns (the "Purchaser Indemnitees")
harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, demands, claims, actions or
causes of action, regulatory, legislative or judicial proceedings or
investigations, assessments, levies, fines, penalties, damages, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys', accountants', investigators', and
experts' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the defense or
investigation of any claim ("Damages") sustained or incurred by any Purchaser
Indemnitee arising from or related to:

  

  

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the Company's representations and
warranties in this Agreement;

  

  

(b) any breach by the Company or any Seller Subsidiary of, or failure by the
Company and/or such Seller Subsidiary to comply with, any of covenants or
obligations of the Company and/or such Seller Subsidiary under this Agreement,
including any breach of Section 8.2 (Liability for Taxes);

  

  

(c) any Indebtedness of any of the Purchased Business Subsidiaries to the
extent not fully discharged at the Closing;

  

  

(d) any Retained Liability (including any Retained Liability that becomes a
Liability of any Purchaser Indemnitee under any bulk transfer Law, common law
doctrine of de facto merger or successor liability or otherwise by operation
of Law); or

  

  

(e) other matters set forth on Schedule 9.1.

  

  

Section 9.2 Limitations on Indemnification Obligations of the Company. The
obligations of the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1 are
subject to the following limitations:

  

  

(a) The Company's representations and warranties in Article III, and the
Purchaser Indemnitees' corresponding rights to indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.1(a), will survive the Closing (and none will merge into any
instrument of conveyance), regardless of any investigation by any Party, as
follows:

  

  

(i) The representations and warranties made in Section 3.1 (Organization),
Section 3.2 (Power and Authority), Section 3.3 (Subsidiaries), Section 3.4
(Enforceability), clause (a)(i) of Section 3.6 (No Conflicts), Section 3.18(c)
(Employee Benefits) and Section 3.27 (Brokers), (collectively, the "Company
Fundamental Warranties") will survive indefinitely;

  

  

(ii) The representations and warranties made in Section 3.22 (Taxes) will
survive until the date that is five (5) years after the Closing Date (the
"Company Extended Warranties");

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

(iii) All representations and warranties made in Article III, other than (x)
the Company Fundamental Warranties and (y) the Company Extended Warranties
(collectively, the "Company Business Warranties") will survive until the date
that is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date;

  

  

provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the expiration of the Company
Extended Warranties or the Company Business Warranties, any Purchaser
Indemnitee (acting in good faith) delivers to the Company a written notice
alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of the
representations and warranties made by the Company (and setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for such Purchaser Indemnitee's belief that such
an inaccuracy or breach exists) and asserting a claim for recovery under
Section 9.1 or prospective recovery under Section 9.1 based on such alleged
inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive
until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

  

  

(b) The Purchaser Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover under Section
9.1(a) for inaccuracies, breaches or alleged inaccuracies or breaches of the
Company Business Warranties or the Company Extended Warranties until the total
amount that Purchaser Indemnitees would recover under Section 9.1(a) but for
this Section 9.2(b) exceeds (i) $1,500,000 (the "Deductible"); or (ii) with
respect to any Damages sustained or incurred by any Purchaser Indemnitee
arising from or related to inaccuracies, breaches or alleged inaccuracies or
breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.19(h),
$500,000 (the "Sub-Deductible"), provided that only $250,000 of the Sub-
Deductible shall apply toward the achievement of the Deductible. If such
amount exceeds the Deductible or the Sub-Deductible, as applicable, then the
Purchaser Indemnitees will be entitled to recover only Damages in excess of
such Deductible or Sub-Deductible.

  

  

(c) The Purchaser Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover under Section
9.1(a) for inaccuracies, breaches or alleged inaccuracies or breaches of the
Company Business Warranties or the Company Extended Warranties for Damages in
the aggregate in excess of $50,000,000 (the "Cap"); provided, further that in
no event will the Purchaser Indemnitees be entitled to recover under Section
9.1 for Damages in the aggregate in excess of the Purchase Price (the
"Aggregate Cap").

  

  

(d) The Purchaser Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover under Section
9.1(a) for inaccuracies, breaches or alleged inaccuracies or breaches of any
of the Company's representations and warranties relating to Taxes for any
Damages that are attributable to Taxes for any Tax period beginning after the
Closing Date or any Post-Closing Straddle Period.

  

  

Section 9.3 Indemnification Obligations of Purchaser. Notwithstanding the
Closing, Purchaser covenants and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the
Company and its Subsidiaries, successors and permitted assigns (the "Seller
Indemnitees," and, together with the Purchaser Indemnitees, the "Indemnitees")
harmless from and against all Damages sustained or incurred by any Seller
Indemnitee arising from or related to:

  

  

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of Purchaser's representations and
warranties in this Agreement; or

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

(b) any breach by Purchaser of, or failure by Purchaser to comply with, any of
its covenants or obligations under this Agreement, including without
limitation, the Empire Side Letter.

  

  

Section 9.4 Limitations on Indemnification Obligations of Purchaser. The
obligations of the Purchaser pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.3 are
subject to the following limitations:

  

  

(a) Purchaser's representations and warranties in Article IV, and the Seller
Indemnitees' corresponding rights to indemnification pursuant to Section
9.3(a), will survive the Closing (and none will merge into any instrument of
conveyance), regardless of any investigation by any Party, as follows:

  

  

(i) The representations and warranties made in Section 4.1 (Organization),
Section 4.2 (Power and Authority), Section 4.3 (Enforceability), clause (a) in
the first sentence of Section 4.5 (No Conflicts) and Section 4.11 (Brokers)
(collectively, the "Purchaser Fundamental Warranties") will survive
indefinitely;

  

  

(ii) All representations and warranties made in Article IV other than the
Purchaser Fundamental Warranties (the "Purchaser Business Warranties") will
survive until the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date;

  

  

provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the expiration of the
applicable Purchaser Business Warranties, any Seller Indemnitee (acting in
good faith) delivers to Purchaser a written notice alleging the existence of
an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of the representations and warranties made
by Purchaser (and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such Seller
Indemnitee's belief that such an inaccuracy or breach exists) and asserting a
claim for recovery under Section 9.3 or prospective recovery under Section 9.3
based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such
notice shall survive until such time as such claim is fully and finally
resolved.

  

  

(b) The Seller Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover under Section
9.3(a) for inaccuracies, breaches or alleged inaccuracies or breaches of the
Purchaser Business Warranties until the total amount that the Seller
Indemnitees would recover under Section 9.3(a) but for this Section 9.4(b)
exceeds the Deductible. If such amount exceeds the Deductible, then the Seller
Indemnitees will be entitled to recover only Damages in excess of the
Deductible.

  

  

(c) The Seller Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover under Section
9.3(a) for inaccuracies, breaches or alleged inaccuracies or breaches of the
Purchaser Business Warranties for Damages in the aggregate in excess of the
Cap; provided, further that in no event will the Seller Indemnitees be
entitled to recover under Section 9.3 for Damages in the aggregate in excess
of the Aggregate Cap.

  

  

Section 9.5 Insurance; Tax Benefits. The amount of any indemnity provided in
Section 9.1 or Section 9.3 (i) shall be computed net of any insurance proceeds
actually received by an Indemnitee in connection with or as a result of any
claim giving rise to an indemnification claim under Sections 9.1 or 9.3
(reduced by the costs of enforcement, deductibles and any retroactive premium
increase and further reduced by the net present value of any other premium

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

increase resulting therefrom), as the case may be, and net of any
reimbursements that are actually received by an Indemnitee in connection with
such Damages or the circumstances giving rise thereto, and (ii) shall be
reduced by any net Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Party to
the extent the claim for which indemnification is sought gives rise to
deductible loss, credit or expense in the taxable period in which such Damage
was incurred, as calculated on a with and without basis. If the indemnity
amount is paid prior to the Indemnitee's actual receipt of insurance proceeds
related thereto, and an Indemnitee subsequently receives such insurance
proceeds, then the Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Company or Purchaser,
as applicable, the amount of insurance proceeds subsequently received (net of
all related costs, expenses and other Damages), but not more, in the
aggregate, than the indemnity amount paid by the Company or Purchaser, as
applicable, to such Indemnitee in respect of such claim. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee shall be obligated
hereunder to submit or file any claim for insurance coverage.

  

  

Section 9.6 Indemnification Claims Procedure.

  

  

(a) If any Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be,
determines in good faith that such Party is entitled to indemnification under
this Article IX, then such Party (the "Indemnified Party") may deliver to the
Company (on behalf of the Company and the Seller Subsidiaries) or Purchaser,
as applicable (the "Indemnifying Party"), a certificate signed by any officer
of the Indemnified Party (a "Claim Certificate"):

  

  

(i) stating that an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification pursuant
to this Article IX;

  

  

(ii) containing, to the extent possible, a good faith non-binding, preliminary
estimate of the amount to which such Indemnified Party claims to be entitled
to receive, which shall be the amount of Damages such Indemnified Party claims
to have so incurred or suffered or could reasonably be expected to incur or
suffer; and

  

  

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by such Indemnified Party) the material facts known to such
Indemnified Party giving rise to such claim.

  

  

No delay in providing such Claim Certificate shall affect an Indemnified
Party's rights hereunder, unless, and then only to the extent that, the
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced.

  

  

(b) If the Indemnifying Party in good faith objects to any claim made in any
Claim Certificate, then such party shall deliver a written notice (a "Claim
Dispute Notice") to the other parties during the thirty (30) calendar day
period commencing upon receipt by the Indemnifying Party of the Claim
Certificate (the "Dispute Notice Period"). The Claim Dispute Notice shall set
forth in reasonable detail the principal basis for the dispute of any claim
made in the relevant Claim Certificate. If no Claim Dispute Notice is
delivered prior to the expiration of the Dispute Notice Period, then (i) each
claim for indemnification set forth in such Claim Certificate shall be deemed
to have been conclusively determined in the relevant Indemnified

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Party's favor for purposes of this Article IX on the terms set forth in such
Claim Certificate and (ii) within three (3) Business Days following the
expiration of the Dispute Notice Period, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver
to the Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such account as is designated by the Indemnified Party, an aggregate amount
equal to the Damages set forth in such Claim Certificate.

  

  

(c) Following delivery of a Claim Dispute Notice, the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party shall then attempt in good faith to resolve any such
objections raised in such Claim Dispute Notice. If the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party agree to a resolution of such objection, then (i) a
memorandum setting forth the matters conclusively determined by the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (including the amount of
indemnifiable Damages, if any) shall be prepared and signed by both parties
and (ii) within three Business Days following the execution by both parties of
such memorandum, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified
Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as is
designated by the Indemnified Party, an aggregate amount equal to the Damages,
if any, set forth in such memorandum.

  

  

(d) If no such resolution can be reached during the thirty (30) calendar day
period following receipt of a given Claim Dispute Notice, then upon the
expiration of such thirty (30) calendar day period, either the Indemnified
Party or the Indemnifying Party may bring suit to resolve such claim in
accordance with Sections 10.13 and 10.14. The decision of the trial court as
to the validity and amount of any claim in such Claim Certificate shall be
non-appealable, binding and conclusive upon the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party. If such decision calls for a payment of Damages to an
Indemnified Party, within three (3) Business Days following the date of such
decision, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as is designated
by the Indemnified Party, an aggregate amount equal to such Damages. Judgment
upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction.

  

  

Section 9.7 Third-Party Claims. If a Third Party notifies an Indemnified Party
of any matter (a "Third-Party Claim") that may give rise to a claim for
indemnification by such Indemnified Party under this Article IX, then such
Indemnified Party will promptly deliver written notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party; provided, that no delay in delivering such notice will
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any indemnification obligation under this
Agreement unless, and then only to the extent that, the Indemnifying Party is
actually and materially prejudiced.

  

  

(a) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to contest, defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with the Third-Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense and with legal counsel of its
choice (reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party); provided, that (i)
the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party, in writing within
thirty (30) days after receiving notice of the Third-Party Claim from the
Indemnified Party, that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified
Party from and against all Damages that the Indemnified Party may suffer
resulting from or related to the Third-Party Claim (the "Defense Election
Notice") and (ii) the Third-Party Claim involves only money damages and does
not seek an injunction or other equitable relief. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 9.7, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the written consent of the Indemnified

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Party, settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or permit a default or
consent to entry of any judgment with respect thereto unless such settlement,
compromise or judgment (i) contains an unqualified release of the Indemnified
Party from all liability in respect of the Third-Party Claim, (ii) contains no
admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party and (iii) is on exclusively
monetary terms.

  

  

(b) If the Indemnifying Party does not timely deliver the Defense Election
Notice in accordance with Section 9.7(a) or elects not to contest, defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim, then
the Indemnified Party shall defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with such Third-Party Claim using counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party. The Party controlling the defense of any Third-Party Claim
(the "Controlling Party") shall, to the extent permitted under applicable Law,
(i) permit the other party (the "Non-Controlling Party") to participate, at
his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third-Party Claim, (ii) conduct
the defense of such Third-Party Claim with reasonable diligence and keep the
Non-Controlling Party reasonably informed of material developments in such
Third-Party Claim at all stages thereof, (iii) promptly submit to the Non-
Controlling Party copies of all pleadings, responsive pleadings, motions and
other similar legal documents and papers received or filed in connection
therewith, (iv) permit the Non-Controlling Party and its counsel to confer on
the conduct of the defense thereof and (v) permit the Non-Controlling Party
and its counsel an opportunity to review all legal papers to be submitted
prior to their submission and consider in good faith any comments from the
Non-Controlling Party and its counsel thereto; provided, that compliance with
the provisions of this Section 9.7(b) does not unreasonably interfere with the
Indemnified Party's defense, settlement or resolution of such Third-Party
Claim.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.7, if the
Indemnified Party is the Controlling Party under Section 9.7(b), the
Indemnified Party shall not have the right to settle, adjust or compromise
such Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, it being
understood that the Indemnifying Party shall consent to any settlement,
adjustment or compromise of such Third-Party Claim that the Indemnified Party
may recommend that (i) does not otherwise impose any equitable remedy on the
Indemnifying Party or any assets of the Indemnifying Party (ii) contains an
unqualified release of the Indemnifying Party from all liability in respect of
the Third-Party Claim, (iii) contains no admission of wrongdoing on the part
of the Indemnifying Party and (iv) is on exclusively monetary terms. In the
event the Indemnified Party fails to diligently pursue the defense of any
Third-Party Claim in a reasonably diligent manner, the Indemnifying Party
shall thereafter have the right to defend against, negotiate, settle, adjust
or compromise or otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim notwithstanding
the limitation in the last sentence of Section 9.7(a).

  

  

(d) This Section 9.7 and Section 9.6 shall not apply to Taxes, which shall be
governed by Section 8.5.

  

  

Section 9.8 Reduction of Closing Consideration. All indemnification payments
made pursuant to this Article IX will be adjustments to the Closing
Consideration and the Second Closing Consideration, if any.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

Section 9.9 Other Indemnification Provisions.

  

  

(a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees (on behalf of itself and all of the
Purchaser Indemnitees) that, the indemnification provisions in this Article IX
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnitees for any
and all claims against the Company for Damages under this Agreement. The
Company acknowledges and agrees (on behalf of itself and all of the Seller
Indemnitees) that, the indemnification provisions in this Article IX and
Section 5.4 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller Indemnitees
for any and all claims against Purchaser for Damages under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall prevent, or be
interpreted to prevent, any of the Parties from bringing an action and
obtaining a remedy based on allegations of Fraud with respect to the other
Parties in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

  

  

(b) As used in this Article IX, the term "Damages" shall not include
speculative or unforeseeable Damages or punitive damages, except to the extent
such punitive damages are sought or obtained by a Third Party. Any liability
for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

  

  

(c) The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made herein,
together with the indemnification provisions herein, are intended among other
things to allocate the economic cost and the risks inherent in the
transactions contemplated hereby between the Parties and, accordingly, a Party
shall be entitled to the indemnification or other remedies provided in this
Agreement by reason of any breach of any such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement by another Party notwithstanding whether any employee,
representative or agent of the Party seeking to enforce a remedy knew or had
reason to know of such breach and regardless of any investigation by such
Party.

  

  

(d) It is the express intent of the Parties that, if the applicable survival
period for an item as contemplated by Sections 9.2(a) or 9.4(a), as
applicable, is shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise
have been applicable to such item, then, by contract, the applicable statute
of limitations with respect to such item shall be reduced to the shortened
survival period contemplated hereby. The Parties further acknowledge that the
time periods set forth in Sections 9.2(a) or 9.4(a), as applicable, for the
assertion of claims under this Agreement are the result of arm's length
negotiation among the Parties and that they intend for the time periods to be
enforced as agreed by the Parties.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Purchaser Indemnitee shall have any right to indemnification under this
Article IX with respect to any Damages to the extent such Damages were
included as a liability accrued for on the face of the Unaudited September
2013 Balance Sheet.

  

  

(f) Any indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Seller
Indemnitees, as the case may be, pursuant to this Article IX shall be effected
by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Company or Purchaser,
as the case may be, to an account designated by any Purchaser Indemnitee or
Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, within fifteen

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(15) days after the final determination thereof; provided, that Purchaser may,
in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to satisfy any indemnification
claim for Damages under this Article IX in excess of $5,000,000 in the
aggregate by issuing to the Company a number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock equal to the aggregate amount of such excess Damages divided by the Fair
Market Value of a share of Purchaser Common Stock.

designate by notice given in accordance with the provisions of this Section
10.2.

  

  

Section 10.3 Fees and Expenses. Subject to Section 1.4, Section 7.4, Section
7.5, Article VIII and Article IX, each Party will bear all fees and expenses
(including financial advisors', attorneys', accountants' and other
professional fees and expenses) incurred by such Party in connection with,
arising from or relating to the negotiation, execution, delivery and
performance of the Transaction Documents and consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions.

  

  

Section 10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the other
Transaction Documents, constitutes the complete agreement and understanding
among the Parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersedes any prior agreement (including, without limitation, the Summary of
Terms, dated August 27, 2013) understanding or representation regarding the
subject matter of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 10.5 Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except
by an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of each of the Parties
hereto.

  

  

Section 10.6 Non-Waiver. The Parties' respective rights and remedies under
this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any
delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this
Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no
single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude
any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver will be effective
unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the
waiving Party. No waiver given will be applicable except in the specific
instance for which it was given. No notice to or demand on a Party will
constitute a waiver of any obligation of such Party or the right of the Party
giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand
as provided in this Agreement.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

Section 10.7 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by a Party without the
prior written consent of all of the Parties to this Agreement; provided, that
Purchaser may, without the prior approval of any other Party, assign any or
all of its rights and interests hereunder (but not its obligations) to any
Affiliate of Purchaser.

  

  

Section 10.8 Binding Effect; Benefit. This Agreement will inure to the benefit
of and bind the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, may be construed to give any
Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns any right, remedy, claim, obligation or liability arising from or
related to this Agreement. This Agreement and all of its provisions and
conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

Section 10.9 Severability. If any court of competent jurisdiction holds any
provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, then the other
provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any
provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or
degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable.

  

  

Section 10.10 References. The headings of Articles and Sections are provided
for convenience only and will not affect the construction or interpretation of
this Agreement. Unless otherwise provided, references to "Article(s)",
"Section(s)" and "Exhibit(s)" refer to the corresponding article(s),
section(s) and exhibit(s) of or to this Agreement. Each Exhibit, Schedule and
Company Disclosure Schedule is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by
reference. Reference to a statute refers to the statute, any amendments or
successor legislation and all rules and regulations promulgated under or
implementing the statute, as in effect at the relevant time. Reference to a
contract, instrument or other document as of a given date means the contract,
instrument or other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time
to time through such date.

  

  

Section 10.11 Construction. Each Party participated in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement, assisted by such legal and tax counsel as it
desired, and contributed to its revisions. Any ambiguities with respect to any
provision of this Agreement will be construed fairly as to all Parties and not
in favor of or against any Party. All pronouns and any variation thereof will
be construed to refer to such gender and number as the identity of the subject
may require. The terms "include" and "including" indicate examples of a
predicate word or clause and not a limitation on that word or clause. Each
Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, it intends that this Agreement be, and that this Agreement
will be treated and construed as, a specialty contract created under seal
under the laws of the State of Delaware with all of the consequences of such a
contract under the laws of the State of Delaware, including causing this
Agreement to be subject to the twenty year limitations period applicable to
sealed instruments, provided that the Parties hereby agree to reduce the
applicable limitations period to (a) twenty-four (24) months with respect to
claims arising out of or relating to Sections 9.2(a)(iii) and 9.4(a)(ii) and
(b) five (5) years with respect to claims arising out of or relating to
Section 9.2(a)(ii).

Section 10.12 Specific Performance. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable
harm would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, without posting bond or other
undertaking, the Parties hereto shall be entitled to injunctive or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of
competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any such action is
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party hereto
will allege, and each Party hereto hereby waives the defense or counterclaim,
that there is an adequate remedy at law. The Parties hereto further agree that
(a) by seeking any remedy provided for in this Section 10.12, a Party hereto
shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that
may be available to such Party hereto under this Agreement and (b) nothing
contained in this Section 10.12 shall require any Party hereto to institute
any action for (or limit such Party's right to institute any action for)
specific performance under this Section 10.12 before exercising any other
right under this Agreement.

  

  

Section 10.13 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware.

  

  

Section 10.14 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each Party hereby (a) agrees to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court located in Wilmington,
Delaware with respect to any claim or cause of action arising under or
relating to this Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions, (b) waives
any objection based on forum non conveniens and waives any objection to venue
of any such suit, action or proceeding, (c) waives personal service of any and
process upon it, and (d) consents that all services of process be made by
registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested)
directed to it at its address stated in Section 10.2 and service so made will
be complete when received. Nothing in this Section 10.14 will affect the
rights of the Parties to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
law.

  

  

Section 10.15 Waiver of Trial by Jury. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  

  

Section 10.16 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or
electronic (.pdf) delivery of original signatures, and in counterparts, each
of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when such counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered,
including by facsimile or other electronic means, to the other party. No Party
may raise (a) the use of a facsimile or email transmission to deliver a
signature or (b) the fact that any signature, agreement or instrument was
signed and subsequently transmitted or communicated through the use of a
facsimile or email transmission as a defense to the formation or
enforceability of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense.

  

  

Section 10.17 Disclosure Schedules. The Company Disclosure Schedules shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions: (a) items shall be arranged in
sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections of this
Agreement; (b) any item disclosed in

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

such Disclosure Schedule with respect to any particular section of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to all other sections
of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the fact
of such disclosure that such disclosure is intended to modify other sections
of the representations and warranties in this Agreement; (c) no disclosure of
any matter contained in such Disclosure Schedule shall create an implication
that such matter meets any standard of materiality, is outside the Ordinary
Course of Business or constitutes noncompliance with, or a violation of
applicable Law, any order by a Governmental Authority or Contract; (d)
headings and introductory language have been inserted on the sections of such
Disclosure Schedule for convenience of reference only and shall to no extent
have the effect of amending or changing the corresponding provisions in this
Agreement; and (e) all references in such Disclosure Schedule to the
enforceability of agreements with Third Parties, the existence or non-
existence of Third-Party rights, the absence of breaches or defaults by third
parties, or similar matters or statements, are intended only to allocate
rights and risks between Purchaser and the Company and were not intended to be
admissions against interests, give rise to any inference or proof of accuracy,
be admissible against any Party to this Agreement by any Person who is not a
party to this Agreement, or give rise to any claim or benefit to any Person
who is not a party to this Agreement.
