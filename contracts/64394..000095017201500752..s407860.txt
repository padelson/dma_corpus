maintain this relationship following the Effective Time, including by
continuing, following the Effective Time, to provide funding to The Mead
Corporation Foundation and to otherwise maintain Mead\'s charitable and
communal endeavors in the Dayton, Ohio community. Mead and Westvaco also

persons as shall be mutually agreed upon with Westvaco to be appointed
directors of Michael Merger Sub and William Merger Sub, respectively, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.   SECTION 2.7 Stockholder Rights
Plan.   Parent shall adopt prior to the Effective Time a stockholder rights
plan, in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit C, so that each share of

OF THE MERGERS ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF  MEAD AND WESTVACO; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES   SECTION 3.1 Effect on Capital Stock of Mead and Michael
Merger Sub.   As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Mead Merger and
without any action on the part of Mead, Michael Merger Sub, Parent or the
holders of any shares of Mead Common Stock (or options thereon) or any shares
of common stock of Michael Merger Sub:   (a) Conversion of Mead Common
Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of Mead Common Stock (other than any
shares of Mead Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and
other than the Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) shall be converted into
the right to receive (i) the amount of $1.20 in cash (the "Cash
Consideration") and (ii) one fully paid and nonassessable share of Parent
Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it
shall be the obligation of Mead to pay the Cash Consideration to each holder
of Mead Common Stock as of the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, all
such shares of Mead Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist. As of the
Effective Time, each holder of a certificate representing any shares of Mead
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive, upon the surrender of any such certificates, (i) the Cash
Consideration for each share of Mead Common Stock so represented and (ii)
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 3.3 without interest. The Cash Consideration and
shares of Parent Common Stock to be received as consideration pursuant to the
Mead Merger with respect to shares of Mead Common Stock is referred to herein
as the "Mead Merger Consideration."   (b) Conversion of Common Stock of
Michael Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock,
without par value, of Michael Merger Sub shall be converted into one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value, of the Mead
Surviving Corporation.   (c) Cancellation of Treasury Shares. Each share of
Mead Common Stock or Parent Common Stock held in the treasury of, or owned
by, Mead or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange thereof.   (d) Assumption and
Conversion of Mead Options.   (i) As of the Effective Time, each option to
purchase Mead Common Stock issued under each Mead Stock Plan (as defined in
Section 4.1(c)) (collectively, the "Mead Options") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and each Limited Right issued under
each Mead Stock Plan (collectively, the "Mead Limited Rights") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
an option (a "Parent Option") or a Limited Right (a "Parent Limited Right"),
as applicable, with respect to the greatest number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock that does not exceed the number of shares of Mead Common
Stock with respect to the Mead Option or Mead Limited Right, as
applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the "Mead
Exchange Ratio". The Mead Exchange Ratio shall be the sum of (x) plus (y),
where (x) is one and (y) is the number equal to the quotient of $1.20 divided
by the Parent Closing Share Value. "Parent Closing Share Value" shall mean
the average of the high and low trading prices of a whole share of
Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the Closing Date, or,
if there shall be no such trading of Parent Common Stock on the Closing
Date, on the first trading date thereafter. The exercise price per share
of Parent Common Stock under the Parent Option or Parent Limited Right,
as applicable, shall be the exercise price per share of Mead Common Stock
with respect to the corresponding Mead Option or Mead Limited Right,
as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
Mead Exchange Ratio (and rounded up to the nearest penny). The parties
hereto acknowledge that (i) each unvested Mead Option issued under each Mead
Stock Plan that is outstanding both on the date hereof and immediately prior
to shareholder approval of the Mead Merger and each Mead Option which
is hereafter issued upon the exercise of a currently outstanding Mead
Option that includes an automatic reload feature and is outstanding
immediately prior to shareholder approval shall become fully vested and
exercisable immediately prior to the approval date in accordance with its
terms, and (ii) each Mead Limited Right that is outstanding upon the date
of shareholder approval of this Agreement shall become fully vested
and exercisable on that date subject to any applicable limitation in its
terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1(d)(i),
(i) an opportunity to purchase Mead Common Stock under the Mead Employees
Stock Purchase Plan shall not be considered a Mead Option, and (ii)
the conversion and assumption provided in this Section 3.1(d) with respect
to any Mead Option which qualifies as an "incentive stock option" (as
defined in section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in a manner consistent
with the requirements of section 424(a) of the Code.   (ii) As of the
Effective Time, Parent shall assume in full each Mead Option and Mead Limited
Right and all of the other rights and obligations of Mead under the Mead
Stock Plans as provided herein. The assumption of a Mead Option or Mead
Limited Right by Parent shall not terminate or modify (except as required
hereunder) any of the terms thereof. After such assumption, Parent shall
issue, upon any partial or total exercise of any Mead Option, in lieu of
shares of Mead Common Stock, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
which the holder of the Mead Option is entitled pursuant to this Agreement.
The assumption by Parent of Mead Options and Mead Limited Rights shall not
give holders of Mead Options and Mead Limited Rights any additional benefits
that they did not have immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), within a
reasonable period of time following the Effective Time, a registration
statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), covering, to the extent applicable, the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of Mead Options assumed by Parent
pursuant hereto. Prior to the Effective Time, Mead shall make such
amendments, if any, to the Mead Stock Plans, and any option or rights award
agreements (subject to the consent of agreement holders, if necessary), as
shall be necessary to permit such assumption in accordance with this Section
3.1(d) and to provide that holders of such options, following the Effective
Time, will not have any rights to acquire Mead Common Stock.   SECTION 3.2
Effect on Capital Stock of Westvaco and William Merger Sub.   As of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Westvaco Merger and without any action on
the part of Westvaco, William Merger Sub, Parent or the holders of any shares
of Westvaco Common Stock (or options thereon) or any shares of common stock
of William Merger Sub:   (a) Conversion of Westvaco Common Stock. Each
issued and outstanding share of Westvaco Common Stock (other than any shares
of Westvaco Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.2(c)) shall
be converted into the right to receive .97 (the "Westvaco Exchange
Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock. As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Westvaco Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist. As of the Effective Time, each holder of a
certificate representing any shares of Westvaco Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon
the surrender of any such certificates, certificates representing the shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 3.3
without interest. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be received as
consideration pursuant to the Westvaco Merger with respect to shares of
Westvaco Common Stock (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock as specified below) is referred to herein as the
"Westvaco Merger Consideration."   (b) Conversion of Common Stock of
William Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of William Merger Sub shall be converted into one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Westvaco Surviving Corporation.   (c) Cancellation of
Treasury Shares. Each share of Westvaco Common Stock held in the treasury of
Westvaco immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange thereof.   (d) Assumption and Conversion of Westvaco
Options.   (i) As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase Westvaco
Common Stock issued under each Westvaco Stock Plan (as defined in Section
4.2(c)) (collectively, the "Westvaco Options") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, each stock appreciation
right issued under each Westvaco Stock Plan (collectively, the "Westvaco
SARs") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
each limited stock appreciation right issued under each Westvaco Stock Plan
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into an option (a "Parent Option"), a stock appreciation right (a
"Parent SAR"), or a limited stock appreciation right (a "Parent LSAR"),
as applicable, with respect to the greatest number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock that does not exceed the number of shares of Westvaco
Common Stock with respect to the Westvaco Option, the Westvaco SAR or the
Westvaco LSAR, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Westvaco Exchange Ratio. The exercise price per share of
Parent Common Stock under the Parent Option, Parent SAR or Parent LSAR, as
applicable, shall be the exercise price per share of Westvaco Common Stock
under the corresponding Westvaco Option, Westvaco SAR or Westvaco LSAR,
as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
Westvaco Exchange Ratio (and rounded up to the nearest penny). The parties
hereto acknowledge that each Westvaco Option, each Westvaco SAR and each
Westvaco LSAR that is outstanding both on the date hereof and immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested and exercisable at
the Effective Time in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 3.2(d)(i), the conversion and
assumption provided in this Section 3.2(d) with respect to any Westvaco
Option which qualifies as an "incentive stock option" (as defined in section
422 of the Code) shall be effected in a manner consistent with the
requirements of section 424(a) of the Code.   (ii) As of the Effective
Time, Parent shall assume in full each Westvaco Option, Westvaco SAR and
Westvaco LSAR and all of the other rights and obligations of Westvaco under
the Westvaco Stock Plans as provided herein. The assumption of a Westvaco
Option, Westvaco SAR or Westvaco LSAR by Parent shall not terminate or modify
(except as required hereunder) any of the terms thereof. After such
assumption, Parent shall issue, upon any partial or total exercise of any
Westvaco Option, in lieu of shares of Westvaco Common Stock, the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holder of the Westvaco Option is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement. The assumption by Parent of Westvaco
Options, Westvaco SARs and Westvaco LSARs shall not give holders of Westvaco
Options, Westvaco SARs and Westvaco LSARs any additional benefits that they
did not have immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall file with
the SEC, within a reasonable period of time following the Effective Time,
a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act, covering,
to the extent applicable, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
upon the exercise of Westvaco Options assumed by Parent pursuant hereto.
Prior to the Effective Time, Westvaco shall make such amendments, if any, to
the Westvaco Stock Plans, and any option or rights award agreement (subject
to the consent of agreement holders, if necessary), as shall be necessary
to permit such assumption in accordance with this Section 3.2(d) and
to provide that holders of such options, SARs and LSARs, following
the Effective Time, will not have any rights to acquire Westvaco Common
Stock.   SECTION 3.3 Exchange of Shares and Certificates.   (a) Exchange
Agent. As of the Effective Time, Mead and Westvaco shall mutually designate a
bank, trust company or nationally recognized shareholder services provider
(the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging, in accordance with this
Article III, Certificates (as defined in Section 3.3(b)) for the Mead Merger
Consideration and the Westvaco Merger Consideration. Parent (and, in the case
of the Cash Consideration, Mead) shall make available to the Exchange Agent,
as needed, the Mead Merger Consideration and the Westvaco Merger
Consideration to be delivered in respect of the shares of Mead Common Stock
and Westvaco Common Stock.   (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Mead Common Stock
or Westvaco Common Stock (the "Certificates") whose shares were converted
into the right to the Mead Merger Consideration or the Westvaco
Merger Consideration, as the case may be, the (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Mead Merger Consideration or the Westvaco Merger Consideration, as the case
may be. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article III and, in the case of holders of Certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Mead Common
Stock, the Cash Consideration in respect of each such share of Mead Common
Stock so represented, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. If any portion of the Mead Merger Consideration or the
Westvaco Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a person
other than the person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration of such Mead
Merger Consideration or Westvaco Merger Consideration, as the case may be,
that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such delivery of
the Mead Merger Consideration or the Westvaco Merger Consideration shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
such registration in the name of a person other than the registered holder
of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive upon such surrender the Mead Merger Consideration or the
Westvaco Merger Consideration, as the case may be. No interest shall be paid
or shall accrue on any cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock.   (c) Distributions with respect to Unexchanged
Shares. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.3(e) until the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article III. Subject to
the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(e) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.   (d) No Further
Ownership Rights in Mead Common Stock or Westvaco Common Stock. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article III (including any cash paid
pursuant to Section 3.3(c) or 3.3(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued
(and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Mead Common Stock or Westvaco Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificates, subject, however, to the obligation of the Mead Surviving
Corporation or the Westvaco Surviving Corporation, as the case may be and as
applicable, to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a
record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made
by Mead and Westvaco on such shares of Mead Common Stock and Westvaco Common
Stock, respectively, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that
remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Mead Surviving
Corporation or the Westvaco Surviving Corporation of the shares of Mead
Common Stock and Westvaco Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Mead Surviving Corporation, the Westvaco Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article III, except as otherwise provided by
law.   (e) Fractional Shares.   (i) No certificates representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
Parent.   (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Westvaco Common Stock converted pursuant to the Westvaco
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fraction as determined below. As
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of full shares of
Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent for issuance
to holders of Certificates of Westvaco Common Stock over (ii) the
aggregate number of full shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to
holders of Certificates of Westvaco Common Stock (such excess being herein
referred to as the "Excess Westvaco Shares"). As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders
of Certificates of Westvaco Common Stock, shall sell the Excess
Westvaco Shares at then prevailing prices on the NYSE, all in the manner
provided herein.   (iii) The sale of the Excess Westvaco Shares by the
Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms
of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable.
Until the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been distributed to
the holders of Certificates of Westvaco Common Stock, the Exchange Agent
will hold such proceeds in trust for such holders. Westvaco shall pay
all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs
of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale or sales of
Excess Westvaco Shares and the Exchange Agent\'s compensation and expenses
in connection with such sale or sales. The Exchange Agent shall determine
the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of Certificates
of Westvaco Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the
amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder
of Certificates of Westvaco Common Stock is entitled (after taking
into account all Certificates then held by such holder) and the denominator
of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which
all holders of Certificates of Westvaco Common Stock are entitled. As soon
as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to
be paid to holders of Certificates with respect to any fractional
share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such amounts to
such holders of Certificates of Westvaco Common Stock subject to and
in accordance with this Section 3.3(e).   (f) Return of Merger
Consideration. Any portion of the Mead Merger Consideration or the Westvaco
Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section
3.3(a) that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for one
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent (other than the
Cash Consideration which shall be delivered to Mead), upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter be entitled to look only to Parent or Mead, as
the case may be, for payment of their claim for any cash, any shares of
Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock.   (g) No Liability. None of Parent, Mead, Michael Merger
Sub, Westvaco, William Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends
or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Mead
Merger Consideration or Westvaco Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificate will not have been surrendered prior to seven
years after the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which any cash, any shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 4.1(b)), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Mead Surviving
Corporation or the Westvaco Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.   (h) Investment of Merger Consideration. The Exchange Agent
shall invest any cash included in the Mead Merger Consideration or the
Westvaco Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant
to Section 3.3(a), as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent, except for interest and other income from investment of the
Cash Consideration which shall be paid to Mead.   (i) Dissenting
Shares.   (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, any shares of Mead Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by persons who will
have properly delivered a written demand for payment of the fair cash value
of such shares of Mead Common Stock in accordance with Section 1701.85 of
the OGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into
or represent the right to receive the Mead Merger Consideration as provided
in Section 3.1(a). Such persons shall be entitled only to such rights as
are granted under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, except that all
Dissenting Shares held by persons who will have failed to perfect or who will
have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights as dissenting shareholders
in respect of such shares under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, the
Mead Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificate therefor in
the manner provided in Section 3.3(b).   (ii) Mead shall give Westvaco (i)
prompt notice of any demands by dissenting shareholders received by Mead,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
OGCL and received by Mead in connection with such demands and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands occurring prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, Mead shall not, except with the prior written consent of Westvaco, make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle
or settle any such demands.   SECTION 3.4 Certain Adjustments.   If
between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Mead Common Stock, Westvaco Common Stock or Parent Common Stock will be
changed into a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or any
dividend payable in stock or other securities will be declared thereon with a
record date within such period, the Westvaco Exchange Ratio and/or the Mead
Merger Consideration and related provisions shall be adjusted accordingly to
provide to the holders of Mead Common Stock and Westvaco Common Stock or Mead
Options and Westvaco Options the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange or dividend.    ARTICLE IV  REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES   SECTION 4.1 Representations and Warranties of Mead.   Except
as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Mead to Westvaco prior

and its subsidiaries (as defined in Section 9.3) is a corporation or
other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the laws
of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite
corporate or other power, as the case may be, and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted, except, as to subsidiaries, for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse
effect (as defined in Section 9.3) on Mead. Each of Mead and its subsidiaries
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or to be in good standing individually or in the aggregate would not
have a material adverse effect on Mead. Mead has delivered to or made
available to Westvaco prior to the execution of this Agreement true and
complete copies of any amendments to the Articles of Incorporation of Mead
(the "Mead Articles") and the regulations of Mead not filed as of the date
hereof with the Mead Filed SEC Documents (as defined in Section 4.1(g)).

Michael Merger Sub and William Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into this Agreement, subject to the Mead Shareholder
Approval (as defined in Section 4.1(m)), to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Mead,
Parent, Michael Merger Sub and William Merger Sub and the consummation by
Mead, Parent, Michael Merger Sub and William Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of Mead, Parent, Michael Merger Sub and William Merger
Sub, subject in the case of the Mead Merger to the Mead Shareholder Approval.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Mead, Parent, Michael
Merger Sub and William Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Westvaco, constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Mead, Parent, Michael Merger Sub and William
Merger Sub, enforceable against Mead, Parent, Michael Merger Sub and
William Merger Sub in accordance with its terms.   (ii) The execution and
delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement
shall not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of a
benefit under, or result in the creation of any pledge, claim, lien, charge,
encumbrance or security interest of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, "Liens") upon any of the properties or assets of Mead or any
of its subsidiaries or in any restriction on the conduct of Mead\'s business
or operations under, (A) the Mead Articles or the regulations of Mead or the
comparable organizational documents of any of its subsidiaries, (B) any loan
or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, trust document, lease
or other agreement, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license or
similar authorization applicable to Mead or any of its subsidiaries or their
respective properties or assets or (C) subject to the governmental filings
and other matters referred to in clause (iii) below, any judgment, order,
decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Mead or any
of its subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, other than,
in the case of clauses (B) and (C), any such conflicts, violations,
defaults, rights, losses, restrictions or Liens that individually or in the
aggregate would not (x) have a material adverse effect on Mead or (y)
reasonably be expected to impair the ability of any of Mead, Parent, Michael
Merger Sub or William Merger Sub to perform its respective obligations under
this Agreement.   (iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of,
action by or in respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with,
any federal, state, local, foreign or supranational government, any
court, administrative, regulatory or other governmental agency, commission
or authority or any non-governmental self-regulatory agency, commission
or authority (a "Governmental Entity") is required by or with respect to
Mead or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Mead, Parent, Michael Merger Sub and William Merger
Sub or the consummation by Mead, Parent, Michael Merger Sub and William
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (A) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust

Common Stock that are to be issued in the Mergers to be listed on the NYSE;
and (E) such other consents, approvals, orders or authorizations the failure
of which to be made or obtained individually or in the aggregate would not
(x) have a material adverse effect on Mead or (y) reasonably be expected
to impair the ability of any of Mead, Parent, Michael Merger Sub and
William Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement.   (c)

business in entities which are not individually or in the aggregate material
to Mead and its subsidiaries as a whole.   (e) SEC Documents; Undisclosed
Liabilities.   (i) Mead and its subsidiaries have filed all
required registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules,

Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to the Mead SEC
Documents, and none of the Mead SEC Documents when filed and at their
respective effective times, if applicable, contained any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   (ii) The

respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance

Mead and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments which are not material).   (iii) Except (A) as reflected
in such financial statements or in the notes thereto, (B) for liabilities
incurred in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and (C) for liabilities incurred since July 1, 2001 in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, neither Mead nor any of its
subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature that,
individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on Mead.   (f) Information Supplied. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by Mead specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4
is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the
time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading or
(ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to
Mead\'s shareholders or at the time of the Mead Shareholders Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement will comply as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except
that no representation or warranty is made by Mead with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by Westvaco specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.   (g) Absence of Certain
Changes or Events. Except for liabilities incurred in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and except as would be

Disclosure Schedule), since July 1, 2001, Mead and its subsidiaries have
conducted their businesses only in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice or as disclosed in any Mead SEC Document filed since such date and
prior to the date hereof, and since July 1, 2001 and, with respect to clauses
(ii) through (vi), prior to the date hereof, there has not been: (i) any
material adverse change in Mead, (ii) any declaration, setting aside or
payment of any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or
property) with respect to any of the capital stock of Mead or any of its
subsidiaries (other than regular quarterly dividends of $0.17 per share of
Mead Common Stock), (iii) any split, combination or reclassification of any
of the capital stock of Mead or any of its subsidiaries or any issuance or
the authorization of any issuance of any other securities in respect of, in
lieu of, or in substitution for shares of the capital stock of Mead or any of
its subsidiaries, except for issuances of Mead Common Stock upon exercise
of Mead Options, in each case awarded prior to the date hereof in
accordance with their present terms or issued pursuant to Section
5.1(a)(taking into account Section 5.1(a) of the Mead Disclosure Schedule) or
to the extent required upon the exercise of a currently outstanding Mead
Option that includes an automatic reload feature, (iv) except insofar as may
have been disclosed in Mead SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior
to the date of this Agreement (as amended to the date hereof, the "Mead Filed
SEC Documents") or required by a change in GAAP, any change in
accounting methods, principles or practices by Mead materially affecting its
assets, liabilities or business, (v) except insofar as may have been
disclosed in the Mead Filed SEC Documents, any tax election that individually
or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on Mead or any of
its tax attributes or any settlement or compromise of any material income
tax liability, or (vi) any action taken by Mead or any of the Mead
subsidiaries during the period from July 1, 2001, through the date of this
Agreement that, if taken during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of Section 5.1(a)
(taking into account Section 5.1(a) of the Mead Disclosure Schedule).   (h)
Compliance with Applicable Laws; Outstanding Orders.   (i) Mead, its
subsidiaries and employees hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions,
orders, registrations and approvals of all Governmental Entities that are
required for the operation of the businesses of Mead and its subsidiaries
(the "Mead Permits"), except where the failure to have any such Mead Permits,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on
Mead. Except as specifically disclosed in the Mead Filed SEC Documents, Mead
and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Mead Permits and
all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies or
guidelines promulgated, or judgments, decisions or orders entered by any
Governmental Entity (all such laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations,
policies, guidelines, judgments, decisions and orders, collectively,
"Applicable Laws") relating to Mead and its subsidiaries or their respective
businesses or properties, except where the failure to be in compliance with
such Applicable Laws individually or in the aggregate would not have a
material adverse effect on Mead. Except as disclosed in the Mead Filed SEC
Documents, no action, demand, requirement or investigation by any
Governmental Entity and no suit, action, investigation or proceeding by any
person, in each case with respect to Mead or any of its subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties, is pending or, to the knowledge (as defined
in Section 9.3) of Mead, threatened, other than, in each case, those the
outcome of which individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to (A) have a material adverse effect on Mead or (B) impair the
ability of any of Mead, Parent, Michael Merger Sub or William Merger Sub to
perform its respective obligations under this Agreement or (C) prevent or
materially delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.   (ii) Neither Mead nor any Mead subsidiary is subject to
any outstanding order, injunction or decree that has had or would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Mead or prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.   (i) Litigation. There is no action,
suit, investigation or proceeding (each, an "Action") pending against or, to
the knowledge of Mead, threatened against or affecting Mead or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or any of their respective
officers or directors before any court or arbitrator or any Governmental
Entity except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Mead, materially impair the
ability of Mead, Parent, Michael Merger Sub or William Merger Sub to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   (j) Absence of
Changes in Benefit Plans. Mead has delivered to Westvaco or made available to
Westvaco for review true and complete copies of (i) all severance and
employment agreements between Mead, on the one hand, and any of its
directors, executive officers or key employees, on the other hand, (ii) all
severance programs and policies of each of Mead and each Mead subsidiary
affecting U.S. employees, and (iii) all plans or arrangements of Mead and
each Mead subsidiary relating to its employees that contain change in control
provisions and, in each case, that has not been filed as an exhibit to a Mead
Filed SEC Document. With respect to each Mead Benefit Plan (as defined in
this Section 4.1(j)) that covers individuals employed in the United States,
Mead has delivered or made available to Westvaco a true, correct and complete
copy of: (i) the most recent annual report (Form 5500 Series) and
accompanying schedule, if any; (ii) the current summary plan description and
any material modifications thereto, if any (in each case, whether or not
required to be furnished under ERISA); (iii) the most recent annual financial
report, if any; and (iv) the most recent actuarial report, if any. Since July
1, 2001, except as would be permitted by Section 5.1(a) as if Section 5.1(a)
were applicable as of July 1, 2001 (including by being set forth in
Section 5.1(a) of the Mead Disclosure Schedule) there has not been any
adoption or amendment by Mead or any of its subsidiaries of any Mead Benefit
Plan or Mead Collective Bargaining Agreement that, when aggregated with other
such adoptions or amendments materially increases the obligations
and liabilities of Mead and its subsidiaries under the Mead
Collective Bargaining Agreements and the Mead Benefit Plans. "Mead Benefit
Plans" shall mean, with respect to current or former directors, officers
or employees of Mead or any of its subsidiaries, any material bonus,
pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation,
stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option, phantom stock,
retirement, vacation, severance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization,
medical or other plan, arrangement or understanding in each case, with
respect to which Mead or any of its subsidiaries could have any liability.
Since July 1, 2001, there has not been any material change in any actuarial
or other assumption used to calculate funding obligations with respect to any
Mead pension plans, or any material change in the manner in which
contributions to any Mead pension plans are made or the basis on which such
contributions are determined. Since July 1, 2001, neither Mead nor any Mead
subsidiary has amended any Mead Options or any Mead Stock Plans to accelerate
the vesting of, or release restrictions on, awards thereunder, or to
provide for such acceleration in the event of a change in control.   (k)
Benefit Plans.   (i) Each Mead Benefit Plan has been administered
in accordance with its terms, except for any failures so to administer
any Mead Benefit Plan that individually or in the aggregate would not have
a material adverse effect on Mead. To the knowledge of Mead, the Mead
Benefit Plans have been operated, and are, in compliance with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable laws and
the terms of all applicable Mead Collective Bargaining Agreements (as defined
in this Section 4.1(k)), except for any failures to be in such compliance
that individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse
effect on Mead. Each Mead Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified
under section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") that it is so
qualified and each trust established in connection with any Mead Benefit Plan
that is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under section
501(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS that such
trust is so exempt. To the knowledge of Mead, no fact or event has occurred
since the date of any determination letter from the IRS that could
affect adversely the qualified status of any such Mead Benefit Plan or the
exempt status of any such trust except for facts or events that can be
cured without any material liability on the part of Mead and its
subsidiaries.   (ii) With respect to each of the Mead Benefit Plans which
is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the present value of accrued benefits
under such plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding
purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such plan\'s actuary
with respect to such plan, did not, as of its latest valuation date, exceed
the then current value of the assets of such plan allocable to such
accrued benefits. No Mead Benefit Plan nor any trust established under a
Mead Benefit Plan has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as
defined in section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code), whether or
not waived, as of the last day of the most recent fiscal year of each of
the Mead Benefit Plans ended prior to the date of this Agreement.   (iii)
No Mead Benefit Plan provides medical benefits (whether or not insured) with
respect to current or former employees after retirement or other termination
of service (other than coverage mandated by applicable law or benefits, the
full cost of which is borne by the current or former employee) other than
individual arrangements the amounts of which are not material.   (iv) Mead
has previously provided to Westvaco a list of each collective bargaining or
other labor union contract applicable to persons employed by Mead or any of
its subsidiaries to which Mead or any of its subsidiaries is a party (each a
"Mead Collective Bargaining Agreement"). No Mead Collective Bargaining
Agreement is being negotiated or renegotiated by Mead or any of its
subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no labor dispute,
strike or work stoppage against Mead or any of its subsidiaries pending or,
to the knowledge of Mead, threatened that may interfere with the respective
business activities of Mead or any of its subsidiaries, except where such
dispute, strike or work stoppage individually or in the aggregate would not
have a material adverse effect on Mead. As of the date of this Agreement, to
the knowledge of Mead, none of Mead, any of its subsidiaries or any of their
respective representatives or employees has committed any material unfair
labor practice in connection with the operation of the respective businesses
of Mead or any of its subsidiaries, and there is no material charge or
complaint against Mead or any of its subsidiaries by the National Labor
Relations Board or any comparable Governmental Entity pending or threatened
in writing.   (v) No employee of Mead or any Mead subsidiary will
be entitled to any material payment, additional benefits or any
acceleration of the time of funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise),
payment or vesting of any benefits under any Mead Benefit Plan as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by virtue of their status as
a "Change in Control" (including equivalent terms such as
"Significant Change") within the meaning of Mead Benefit Plans (either alone
or in conjunction with any other event such as a termination of
employment).   (vi) Except such as would not have a material adverse
effect on Mead, there are no material unresolved claims or disputes under
the terms of, or in connection with, any Mead Benefit Plan (other than
routine undisputed claims for benefits), and no action, legal or otherwise,
has been commenced with respect to any material claim.   (vii) To the
knowledge of Mead, no non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning
of section 4975(c) of the Code) involving any Mead Benefit Plan has occurred
that could subject Mead to any material tax penalty or other cost or
liability (by indemnification or otherwise).   (viii) No liability under
Title IV of ERISA has been incurred and not yet satisfied by Mead or any of
its subsidiaries, or any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) that
together with Mead or such subsidiary would have been deemed a "single
employer" within the meaning of section 4001(b) of ERISA at any time within
the six-year period ending on the Closing Date (a "Mead ERISA Affiliate")
since the effective date of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full. No
condition exists that presents a material risk to Mead or any of its
subsidiaries of incurring a liability under such Title, other than liability
for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. To the extent this
representation applies to section 4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of ERISA, it
is made not only with respect to the Mead Benefit Plans, but also with
respect to any employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
subject to Title IV of ERISA to which Mead or any of its subsidiaries or a
Mead ERISA Affiliate made, or was required to make, contributions during the
six-year period ending on the Closing Date.   (ix) To the knowledge of
Mead, all Mead Benefit Plans subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside
of the United States (i) have been maintained in accordance with all
applicable requirements, (ii) if they are intended to qualify for special tax
treatment meet all requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if they are
intended to be funded and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book
reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.  
(l) Taxes.   (i) Each of Mead and its subsidiaries has timely filed or
has caused to be timely filed all material Tax Returns required to be filed
by, or with respect to, Mead and its subsidiaries and all such Tax Returns
are true, complete, and correct in all material respects. Mead and each of
its subsidiaries have paid (or Mead has paid or caused to be paid on
its behalf) all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns, and the most
recent financial statements contained in the Mead Filed SEC Documents reflect
an adequate reserve in accordance with GAAP for all Tax liabilities of
Mead and its subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof
accrued through the date of such financial statements.   (ii) No
deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed in
writing against Mead or any of its subsidiaries that are not adequately
reserved for, except for deficiencies that individually or in the aggregate
would not have a material adverse effect on Mead.   (iii) Neither Mead nor
any of its subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement,
plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to preclude (A) the
Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as a transaction described in
Section 351 of the Code or (B) either of the Mergers from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (iv)
There is no audit, assessment, deficiency, claim, investigation, examination,
matter in controversy, proposed adjustment, refund litigation or other
proceeding (judicial or administrative) currently pending with regard to any
Taxes or Tax Returns of Mead or its subsidiaries the adverse outcome of
which, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on Mead.   (v) Neither Mead nor any of its
subsidiaries is liable for any Tax imposed on any other entity, except as the
result of the application of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (and any
comparable provision of the tax laws of any state, local or foreign
jurisdiction) to the affiliated group of which Mead is the common parent.  
(vi) There are no liens for Taxes on any of the assets of Mead or its
subsidiaries, except for statutory liens for Taxes that are not yet due and
payable.   (vii) Neither Mead nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement, plan, contract or arrangement that could result, individually or
in aggregate, in a payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code.   (viii) Neither Mead nor any of its
subsidiaries has been included in any "consolidated," "unitary" or "combined"
Tax Return (other than Tax Returns which include only Mead and subsidiaries
of Mead) provided for under the laws of the United States, any foreign
jurisdiction or any state or locality with respect to material Taxes for any
taxable period for which the statute of limitations has not expired (taking
into account all applicable extensions).   (ix) No election under section
341(f) of the Code has been made or shall be made prior to the Closing Date
to treat Mead or any of its subsidiaries as a consenting corporation, as
defined in section 341 of the Code.   (x) "Tax" or "Taxes" means all taxes,
charges, levies or other like assessments imposed by any governmental
authority, including any income, gross receipts, license, severance,
occupation, premium, environmental (including taxes under Code Section 59A),
customs, duties, profits, disability, alternative or add-on minimum,
estimated, withholding, payroll, employment, unemployment insurance, social
security (or similar), excise, sales, use, value-added, occupancy, franchise,
real property, personal property, business and occupation, mercantile,
windfall profits, capital stock, stamp, transfer, workmen\'s compensation or
other taxes, charges, levies or other like assessments of any kind
whatsoever, together with any interest, penalties, additions to tax or
additional amounts imposed by any Governmental Entity, whether disputed or
not. "Tax Authority" means any Governmental Entity responsible for the
administration of any Taxes. "Tax Return" means any returns, declarations,
statements, claim for refund, election, estimate, reports, forms and
information returns and any schedules or amendments thereto relating to
Taxes.   (m) Voting Requirements. The affirmative vote at the
Mead Shareholders Meeting (the "Mead Shareholder Approval") of the holders
of two-thirds of all outstanding shares of Mead Common Stock is necessary
to approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated. The Mead Shareholder Approval is the only vote necessary to
approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (n) Rights
Agreement. The Board of Directors of Mead has resolved to, and promptly after
the execution hereof Mead shall, take all action necessary to render the Mead
Rights inapplicable to this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and to cause the Mead Rights to expire immediately prior
to the Effective Time.   (o) Takeover Statutes and Charter Provisions.
Assuming that Westvaco does not own, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of
the Mead Common Stock, the Board of Directors of Mead has taken all action
necessary to render any potentially applicable anti-takeover or similar
statute or regulation inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.   (p) Intellectual Property.   (i) Mead and its
subsidiaries own, free and clear of all Liens, or have the right to use
pursuant to valid license, sublicense, agreement or permission all items of
Intellectual Property necessary for their operations, as currently conducted
or as contemplated by them to be conducted, except where the failure to own
or have such rights, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Mead. The conduct of Mead\'s
and its subsidiaries\' businesses, as currently conducted or contemplated by
them to be conducted, does not interfere, infringe, misappropriate, dilute
or violate any of the Intellectual Property rights of any third party,
except for interferences, infringements, misappropriations, dilutions
or violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on Mead. To the
knowledge of Mead, no third party has interfered with, infringed upon,
misappropriated, diluted, violated or otherwise come into conflict with any
Intellectual Property rights of Mead or any of its subsidiaries, except
for interferences, infringements, misappropriations, dilutions or
violations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Mead.   (ii) As used in this
Agreement, "Intellectual Property" means, collectively, patents, trademarks,
service marks, trade dress, logos, trade names, Internet domain names,
designs, slogans and general intangibles of like nature, copyrights and all
registrations, applications, reissuances, continuations, continuations-in-
part, revisions, extensions, reexaminations and associated goodwill with
respect to each of the foregoing, computer software (including source and
object codes), computer programs, computer databases and related
documentation and materials, data, documentation, technology, trade secrets,
confidential business information (including ideas, formulae, algorithms,
models, methodologies, compositions, know-how, manufacturing and production
processes and techniques, research and development information, drawings,
designs, plans, proposals and technical data, financial, marketing and
business data and pricing and cost information) and other intellectual
property rights (in whatever form or medium).   (q) Certain Contracts.
Except as set forth in the Mead Filed SEC Documents, neither Mead nor any of
its subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (i) any "material contract" (as
such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), or
(ii) any non-competition agreement or any other agreement or obligation which
purports to limit in any material respect the manner in which, or the
localities in which, all or any material portion of the businesses of Mead
and its subsidiaries (including, for purposes of this Section 4.1(q), Parent,
Westvaco and its subsidiaries, assuming the Mergers have taken place), taken
as a whole, is or would be conducted (all contracts of the types described in
clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the "Mead Material Contracts"). Mead has
delivered to Westvaco or provided to Westvaco for review, prior to the
execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of all Mead Material
Contracts not filed as exhibits to the Mead Filed SEC Documents. Each Mead
Material Contract is valid and binding on Mead (or, to the extent a Mead
subsidiary is a party, such subsidiary) and is in full force and effect, and
Mead and each Mead subsidiary have in all material respects performed
all obligations required to be performed by them to date under each
Mead Material Contract, except where such noncompliance, individually or in
the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on Mead. Neither
Mead nor any Mead subsidiary knows of, or has received notice of, any
violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of Mead, does there exist
any condition that with the passage of time or the giving of notice or
both would result in such a violation or default under) any Mead
Material Contract.   (r) Environmental Protection. Environmental
Protection.   (i) Except as set forth in the Mead Filed SEC Documents:  
(1) Mead and each of the Mead subsidiaries are in  compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws (as defined in  Section 4.1(r)(ii)(2)) and
neither Mead nor any of the Mead  subsidiaries has received any communication
(written or oral) from any  person or Governmental Authority that alleges
that Mead or any of the  Mead subsidiaries is not in such compliance with
applicable  Environmental Laws, except where the failure to so comply or
where such  alleged non-compliance would not have a material adverse effect
on  Mead. To the knowledge of Mead, compliance with all applicable 
Environmental Laws will not require Mead or any Mead subsidiary to  incur
costs, beyond those currently budgeted for the three Mead fiscal  years
beginning with January 1, 2001, that will be reasonably likely to  result in
a material adverse effect on Mead, including, but not limited  to, the costs
of pollution control equipment that are known or  anticipated to be required
in the future.   (2) Mead and each of the Mead subsidiaries have obtained 
or have applied for all environmental, health and safety permits and 
governmental authorizations (collectively, the "Environmental Permits") 
necessary for the construction of their facilities or the conduct of  their
operations except where the failure to so obtain would not have a  material
adverse effect on Mead, and all such Environmental Permits are  in good
standing or, where applicable, a renewal application has been  timely filed
and is pending agency approval, and Mead and the Mead  subsidiaries are in
material compliance with all terms and conditions  of the Environmental
Permits, except where failure to so comply would  not reasonably likely have
a material adverse effect on Mead.   (3) To the best knowledge of Mead,
there are no  Environmental Claims (as defined in Section 4.1(r)(ii)(1)), 
individually or in the aggregate, that would have a material adverse  effect
on Mead pending (A) against Mead or any of the Mead  subsidiaries, (B)
against any person or entity whose liability for any  Environmental Claim
Mead or any of the Mead subsidiaries has or may  have retained or assumed
either contractually or by operation of law,  or (C) against any real or
personal property or operations which Mead  or any of the Mead subsidiaries
owns, leases or manages, in whole or in  part.   (4) Mead has no knowledge
of any Releases (as defined in  Section 4.1(r)(ii)(4)) of any Hazardous
Material (as defined in Section  4.1(r)(ii)(3)) that would be reasonably
likely to form the basis of any  Environmental Claim against Mead or any of
the Mead subsidiaries, or  against any person or entity whose liability for
any Environmental  Claim Mead or any of the Mead subsidiaries has or may have
retained or  assumed either contractually or by operation of law except for
any  Environmental Claims, individually or in the aggregate, that would not 
reasonably likely have a material adverse effect on Mead.   (ii)
Definitions. As used in this Agreement:   (1) "Environmental Claim" means
any and all  administrative, regulatory or judicial actions, suits, demands,
demand  letters, directives, claims, liens, investigations, proceedings or 
notices of noncompliance or violation (written or oral) by any person  or

(including, without limitation, potential responsibility for  or liability
for enforcement, investigatory costs, cleanup costs,  governmental response
costs, removal costs, remedial costs, natural  resources damages, property
damages, personal injuries or penalties)  arising out of, based on or
resulting from (A) the presence, Release or  threatened Release into the
environment of any Hazardous Materials at  any location, whether or not
owned, operated, leased or managed by Mead  or any of the Mead subsidiaries
(for purposes of this Section 4.1(r))  or by Westvaco or any of the Westvaco

the basis of any  violation or alleged violation of any Environmental Law; or

indemnification, cost recovery, compensation or injunctive relief  resulting
from the presence or Release of any Hazardous Materials.   (2)
"Environmental Laws" means all federal, state and  local laws, rules and
regulations relating to pollution, the  environment (including, without
limitation, ambient air, surface water,  groundwater, land surface or

environment including, without limitation,  laws and regulations relating to
Releases or threatened Releases of  Hazardous Materials, or otherwise
relating to the manufacture,  processing, distribution, use, treatment,
storage, disposal, transport  or handling of Hazardous Materials.   (3)
"Hazardous Materials" means (A) any petroleum or  petroleum products,

Westvaco or any of the Westvaco  subsidiaries operates (for purposes of
Section 4.2(r)).   (4) "Release" means any release, spill, emission, 
leaking, injection, deposit, disposal, discharge, dispersal, leaching  or
migration into the atmosphere, soil, surface water, groundwater or 
property.   (s) Opinion of Financial Advisors. Mead has received the
opinion of Goldman, Sachs and Co. ("Goldman Sachs"), dated the date of
this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the Mead
Merger Consideration is fair from a financial point of view to Mead
shareholders.   (t) Brokers. Except for fees payable to Goldman Sachs
pursuant to an engagement letter, dated as of April 9, 2001, no broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other person is entitled to any
broker\'s, finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Mead.   SECTION 4.2

this Agreement (the "Westvaco Disclosure Schedule") and making reference to
the particular subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken

Schedules), Westvaco represents and warrants to Mead as follows:   (a)
Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of Westvaco and its
subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize
such concept) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and
has the requisite corporate or other power, as the case may be, and authority
to carry on its business as now being conducted, except, as to subsidiaries,
for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing individually or in the aggregate would not have a material
adverse effect on Westvaco. Each of Westvaco and its subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in
good standing individually or in the aggregate would not have a material
adverse effect on Westvaco. Westvaco has delivered to or made available to
Mead prior to the execution of this Agreement true and complete copies of any
amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation of Westvaco (the "Westvaco
Certificate") and by-laws not filed as of the date hereof with the Westvaco

and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Westvaco, subject in the case of the Westvaco Merger to the Westvaco
Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Westvaco and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the other parties hereto, constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligation of Westvaco enforceable against Westvaco in
accordance with its terms.   (ii) The execution and delivery of this
Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement shall not,
conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of a
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries or any
restriction on the conduct of Westvaco\'s business or operations under, (A)

Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the execution and

and its subsidiaries as a whole.   (e) SEC Documents; Undisclosed

the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such
Westvaco SEC Documents, and none of the Westvaco SEC Documents when filed and
at their respective effective times, if applicable, contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

misleading.   (ii) The financial statements of Westvaco included in

consolidated financial position of Westvaco and its consolidated subsidiaries
as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and

material).   (iii) Except (A) as reflected in such financial statements
or in the notes thereto, (B) for liabilities incurred in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (C) for
liabilities incurred since May 1, 2001 in the ordinary course of business

on Westvaco.   (f) Information Supplied. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by Westvaco specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (i) the Form S- 4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed
with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time
it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the

Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except
that no representation or warranty is made by Westvaco with respect
to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by Mead specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4.   (g) Absence of
Certain Changes or Events. Except for liabilities incurred in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and except as would
be permitted by Section 5.1(b) as if Section 5.1(b) were applicable as of May
1, 2001 (including by being set forth in Section 5.1(b) of the Westvaco
Disclosure Schedule), since May 1, 2001, Westvaco and its subsidiaries have
conducted their businesses only in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice or as disclosed in any Westvaco SEC Document filed since such date
and prior to the date hereof, and since May 1, 2001 and, with respect to
clauses (ii) through (vi), prior to the date hereof, there has not been: (i)
any material adverse change in Westvaco, (ii) any declaration, setting aside
or payment of any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or
property) with respect to any of the capital stock of Westvaco or any of its
subsidiaries (other than regular quarterly dividends of $0.22 per share of
Westvaco Common Stock), (iii) any split, combination or reclassification of
any of the capital stock of Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries or any
issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any other securities in
respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of the capital stock of
Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries, except for issuances of Westvaco Common
Stock in connection with Westvaco\'s Investor Services Plan or upon exercise
of Westvaco Options, in each case awarded prior to the date hereof
in accordance with their present terms or issued pursuant to Section
5.1(b) (taking into account Section 5.1(b) of the Westvaco Disclosure
Schedule), (iv) except insofar as may have been disclosed in Westvaco SEC
Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement
(as amended to the date hereof, the "Westvaco Filed SEC Documents") or
required by a change in GAAP, any change in accounting methods, principles
or practices by Westvaco materially affecting its assets, liabilities
or business, (v) except insofar as may have been disclosed in the
Westvaco Filed SEC Documents, any tax election that individually or in the
aggregate would have a material adverse effect on Westvaco or any of its
tax attributes or any settlement or compromise of any material income
tax liability or (vi) any action taken by Westvaco or any of the
Westvaco subsidiaries during the period from May 1, 2001, through the date of
this Agreement that, if taken during the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of Section
5.1(b) (taking into account Section 5.1(b) of the Westvaco Disclosure
Schedule).   (h) Compliance with Applicable Laws; Outstanding Orders.  
(i) Westvaco, its subsidiaries and employees hold all permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, orders, registrations and approvals of all
Governmental Entities that are required for the operation of the businesses
of Westvaco and its subsidiaries (the "Westvaco Permits") except where the
failure to have any such Westvaco Permits, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a material adverse effect on Westvaco. Except as specifically
disclosed in the Westvaco Filed SEC Documents, Westvaco and its subsidiaries
are in compliance with the terms of the Westvaco Permits and all Applicable
Laws relating to Westvaco and its subsidiaries or their respective business
or properties, except where the failure to be in compliance with such
Applicable Laws individually or in the aggregate would not have a material
adverse effect on Westvaco. Except as disclosed in the Westvaco Filed SEC
Documents, no action, demand, requirement or investigation by any
Governmental Entity and no suit, action, investigation or proceeding by any
person, in each case with respect to Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties, is pending or, to the knowledge of
Westvaco, threatened, other than, in each case, those the outcome of which
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to (A) have
a material adverse effect on Westvaco or (B) impair the ability of Westvaco
to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (C) prevent or materially
delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.  
(ii) Neither Westvaco nor any Westvaco subsidiary is subject to any
outstanding order, injunction or decree that has had or would, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Westvaco or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (i) Litigation. There is no Action
pending against or, to the knowledge of Westvaco, threatened against or
affecting Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or any of their respective officers or directors before any court
or arbitrator or any Governmental Entity except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Westvaco, materially impair the ability of Westvaco to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   (j) Absence of
Changes in Benefit Plans. Westvaco has delivered to Mead or made available to
Mead for review true and complete copies of (i) all severance and employment
agreements between Westvaco, on the one hand, and of its directors, executive
officers or key employees, on the other hand, (ii) all severance programs and
policies of each of Westvaco and each Westvaco subsidiary affecting U.S.
employees, and (iii) all plans or arrangements of Westvaco and each Westvaco
subsidiary relating to its employees that contain change in control
provisions and, in each case, that has not been filed as an exhibit to a
Westvaco Filed SEC Document. With respect to each Westvaco Benefit Plan (as
defined in this Section 4.2(j)) that covers individuals employed in the
United States, Westvaco has delivered or made available to Mead a true,
correct and complete copy of: (i) the most recent annual report (Form 5500
Series) and accompanying schedule, if any; (ii) the current summary plan
description and any material modifications thereto, if any (in each case,
whether or not required to be furnished under ERISA); (iii) the most recent
annual financial report, if any; and (iv) the most recent actuarial report,
if any. Since May 1, 2001, except as would be permitted by Section 5.1(b)
as if Section 5.1(b) were applicable as of May 1, 2001 (including by being
set forth in Section 5.1(b) of the Westvaco Disclosure Schedule), there has
not been any adoption or amendment by Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries
of any Westvaco Benefit Plan or Westvaco Collective Bargaining Agreement
that, when aggregated with other such adoptions or amendments,
materially increases the obligations and liabilities of Westvaco and its
subsidiaries under the Westvaco Collective Bargaining Agreements and the
Westvaco Benefit Plans. "Westvaco Benefit Plans" shall mean, with respect to
current or former directors, officers or employees of Westvaco or any of
its subsidiaries, any material bonus, pension, profit sharing,
deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock
purchase, stock option, phantom stock, retirement, vacation, severance,
disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or other plan,
arrangement or understanding, in each case, with respect to which Westvaco or
any of its subsidiaries could have any liability. Since May 1, 2001, there
has not been any material change in any actuarial or other assumption used
to calculate funding obligations with respect to any Westvaco pension
plans, or any material change in the manner in which contributions to any
Westvaco pension plans are made or the basis on which such contributions
are determined. Since May 1, 2001, neither Westvaco nor any Westvaco
subsidiary has amended any Westvaco Options or any Westvaco Stock Plans to
accelerate the vesting of, or release restrictions on, awards thereunder, or
to provide for such acceleration in the event of a change in control.   (k)
Benefit Plans.   (i) Each Westvaco Benefit Plan has been administered
in accordance with its terms, except for any failures so to administer
any Westvaco Benefit Plan that individually or in the aggregate would not
have a material adverse effect on Westvaco. To the knowledge of Westvaco,
the Westvaco Benefit Plans have been operated, and are, in compliance with
the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable laws
and the terms of all Westvaco Collective Bargaining Agreements (as defined
in this Section 4.2(k)), except for any failures to be in such compliance
that individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse
effect on Westvaco. Each Westvaco Benefit Plan that is intended to be
qualified under section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS that it is so qualified and each
trust established in connection with any Westvaco Benefit Plan that is
intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under section 501(a) of
the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS that such trust is
so exempt. To the knowledge of Westvaco, no fact or event has occurred
since the date of any determination letter from the IRS that could
affect adversely the qualified status of any such Westvaco Benefit Plan or
the exempt status of any such trust except for facts or events that can
be cured without any material liability on the part of Westvaco and
its subsidiaries.   (ii) With respect to each of the Westvaco Benefit Plans
which is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the present value of accrued
benefits under such plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for
funding purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such
plan\'s actuary with respect to such plan, did not, as of its latest
valuation date, exceed the then current value of the assets of such plan
allocable to such accrued benefits. No Westvaco Benefit Plan nor any trust
established under a Westvaco Benefit Plan has incurred any "accumulated
funding deficiency" (as defined in section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of
the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the most recent
fiscal year of each of the Westvaco Benefit Plans ended prior to the date of
this Agreement.   (iii) No Westvaco Benefit Plan provides medical
benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or former employees
after retirement or other termination of service (other than coverage
mandated by applicable law or benefits, the full cost of which is borne by
the current or former employee) other than individual arrangements the
amounts of which are not material.   (iv) Westvaco has previously provided
to Mead a list of each collective bargaining or other labor union contract
applicable to persons employed by Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries to
which Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries is a party (each a "Westvaco
Collective Bargaining Agreement"). No Westvaco Collective Bargaining
Agreement is being negotiated or renegotiated by Westvaco or any of its
subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no labor dispute,
strike or work stoppage against Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries pending
or, to the knowledge of Westvaco, threatened that may interfere with the
respective business activities of Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries, except
where such dispute, strike or work stoppage individually or in the
aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on Westvaco. As of the
date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Westvaco, none of Westvaco, any
of its subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives or employees
has committed any material unfair labor practice in connection with
the operation of the respective businesses of Westvaco or any of
its subsidiaries, and there is no material charge or complaint against
Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries by the National Labor Relations Board or
any comparable Governmental Entity pending or threatened in writing.   (v)
No employee of Westvaco or any Westvaco subsidiary will be entitled to any
material payment, additional benefits or any acceleration of the time of
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise), payment or vesting of any
benefits under any Westvaco Benefit Plan as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by virtue of their status as a "Change in
Control" (including equivalent terms such as "Significant Change") within the
meaning of the Westvaco Benefit Plans (either alone or in conjunction with
any other event such as a termination of employment).   (vi) Except as
would not have a material adverse effect on Westvaco, there are no material
unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, any
Westvaco Benefit Plan (other than routine undisputed claims for benefits),
and no action, legal or otherwise, has been commenced with respect to any
material claim.   (vii) To the knowledge of Westvaco, no non-exempt
"prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of section 4975(c) of the Code)
involving any Westvaco Benefit Plan has occurred that could subject Westvaco
to any material tax penalty or other cost or liability (by indemnification
or otherwise).   (viii) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been
incurred and not yet satisfied by Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries, or any
trade or business (whether or not incorporated) that together with Westvaco
or such subsidiary would have been deemed a "single employer" within
the meaning of section 4001(b) of ERISA at any time within the six-year
period ending on the Closing Date (a "Westvaco ERISA Affiliate") since
the effective date of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full. No
condition exists that presents a material risk to Westvaco or any of its
subsidiaries of incurring a liability under such Title, other than liability
for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. To the extent
this representation applies to section 4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of
ERISA, it is made not only with respect to the Westvaco Benefit Plans, but
also with respect to any employee benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to which Westvaco or any of
its subsidiaries or a Westvaco ERISA Affiliate made, or was required to
make, contributions during the six-year period ending on the Closing
Date.   (ix) To the knowledge of Westvaco, all Westvaco Benefit
Plans subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States
(i) have been maintained in accordance with all applicable requirements,
(ii) if they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment meet
all requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if they are intended to
be funded and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book reserved,
as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.   (x) Westvaco
has taken such actions as are necessary to assure that no funding of any
Westvaco grantor trust is required to occur in connection with the execution
of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.   (l) Taxes.   (i) Each of Westvaco and its subsidiaries has
timely filed or has caused to be timely filed all material Tax Returns
required to be filed by, or with respect to, Westvaco and its subsidiaries
and all such Tax Returns are true, complete, and correct in all material
respects. Westvaco and each of its subsidiaries have paid (or Westvaco has
paid or caused to be paid on its behalf) all Taxes shown as due on such Tax
Returns, and the most recent financial statements contained in the Westvaco
Filed SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with GAAP for
all Tax liabilities of Westvaco and its subsidiaries for all taxable periods
and portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial
statements.   (ii) No deficiencies for any Taxes have been
proposed, asserted or assessed in writing against Westvaco or any of its
subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved for, except for deficiencies
that individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse
effect on Westvaco.   (iii) Neither Westvaco nor any of its subsidiaries
has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other
circumstance that is reasonably likely to preclude (A) the Mergers, taken
together, from qualifying as a transaction described in Section 351 of the
Code or (B) either of the Mergers from qualifying as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (iv) There is no audit,
assessment, deficiency, claim, investigation, examination, matter in
controversy, proposed adjustment, refund litigation or other proceeding
(judicial or administrative) currently pending with regard to any Taxes or
Tax Returns of Westvaco or its subsidiaries the adverse outcome of which,
individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on Westvaco.   (v) Neither Westvaco nor any of its
subsidiaries is liable for any Tax imposed on any other entity, except as the
result of the application of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (and any
comparable provision of the tax laws of any state, local or foreign
jurisdiction) to the affiliated group of which Westvaco is the common
parent.   (vi) There are no liens for Taxes on any of the assets
of Westvaco or its subsidiaries, except for statutory liens for Taxes that
are not yet due and payable.   (vii) Neither Westvaco nor any of its
subsidiaries is a party to any agreement, plan, contract or arrangement that
could result, individually or in aggregate, in a payment of any "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.  
(viii) Neither Westvaco nor any of its subsidiaries has been included in any
"consolidated," "unitary" or "combined" Tax Return (other than Tax Returns
which include only Westvaco and subsidiaries of Westvaco) provided for under
the laws of the United States, any foreign jurisdiction or any state or
locality with respect to material Taxes for any taxable period for which the
statute of limitations has not expired (taking into account all applicable
extensions).   (ix) No election under section 341(f) of the Code has
been made or shall be made prior to the Closing Date to treat Westvaco or any
of its subsidiaries as a consenting corporation, as defined in section 341
of the Code.   (m) Voting Requirements.   The affirmative vote at the
Westvaco Stockholders Meeting (the "Westvaco Stockholder Approval") of the
holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of Westvaco Common Stock
entitled to vote at a duly convened and held meeting of Westvaco stockholders
is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Westvaco\'s capital
stock necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Westvaco Merger.   (n) Rights Agreement.
The Board of Directors of Westvaco has resolved to, and promptly after the
execution hereof Westvaco shall, take all action necessary to render the
Westvaco Rights inapplicable to this Agreement, the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and to cause the Westvaco Rights to expire
immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (o) Takeover Statutes and
Charter Provisions. The Board of Directors of Westvaco has taken all action
necessary to render Section 203 of the DGCL, any other potentially applicable
anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation and the provisions of Article
Eleventh of the Westvaco Certificate inapplicable to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (p) Intellectual Property. Westvaco and
its subsidiaries own, free and clear of all Liens, or have the right to use
pursuant to valid license, sublicense, agreement or permission all items of
Intellectual Property necessary for their operations, as currently conducted
or as contemplated by them to be conducted, except where the failure to own
or have such rights, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Westvaco. The conduct of
Westvaco\'s and its subsidiaries\' businesses, as currently conducted or
contemplated by them to be conducted, does not interfere, infringe,
misappropriate, dilute or violate any of the Intellectual Property rights of
any third party, except for interferences, infringements, misappropriations,
dilutions or violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on Westvaco. To the
knowledge of Westvaco, no third party has interfered with, infringed
upon, misappropriated, diluted, violated or otherwise come into conflict with
any Intellectual Property rights of Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries,
except for interferences, infringements, misappropriations, dilutions
or violations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Westvaco.   (q) Certain
Contracts. Except as set forth in the Westvaco Filed SEC Documents, neither
Westvaco nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (i) any
"material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation
S-K of the SEC), or (ii) any non- competition agreement or any other
agreement or obligation which purports to limit in any material respect the
manner in which, or the localities in which, all or any material portion of
the businesses of Westvaco and its subsidiaries (including, for purposes of
this Section 4.2(q), Parent, Mead and its subsidiaries, assuming the Mergers
have taken place), taken as a whole, is or would be conducted (all contracts
of the types described in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the "Westvaco
Material Contracts"). Westvaco has delivered to Mead or provided to Mead for
review, prior to the execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of
all Westvaco Material Contracts not filed as exhibits to the Westvaco Filed
SEC Documents. Each Westvaco Material Contract is valid and binding on
Westvaco (or, to the extent a Westvaco subsidiary is a party, such
subsidiary) and is in full force and effect, and Westvaco and each Westvaco
subsidiary have in all material respects performed all obligations required
to be performed by them to date under each Westvaco Material Contract, except
where such noncompliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
material adverse effect on Westvaco. Neither Westvaco nor any Westvaco
subsidiary knows of, or has received notice of, any violation or default
under (nor, to the knowledge of Westvaco, does there exist any condition that
with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such
a violation or default under) any Westvaco Material Contract.   (r)
Environmental Protection.   (i) Except as set forth in the Westvaco Filed
SEC Documents:   (1) Westvaco and each of the Westvaco subsidiaries are  in
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws (as defined in  Section
4.1(r)(ii)(2)) and neither Westvaco nor any of the Westvaco  subsidiaries has
received any communication (written or oral) from any  person or Governmental
Authority that alleges that Westvaco or any of  the Westvaco subsidiaries is
not in such compliance with applicable  Environmental Laws, except where the
failure to so comply or where such  alleged non-compliance would not have a
material adverse effect on  Westvaco. To the knowledge of Westvaco,
compliance with all applicable  Environmental Laws will not require Westvaco
or any Westvaco subsidiary  to incur costs, beyond those currently budgeted
for the three Westvaco  fiscal years beginning with November 1, 2000, that
will be reasonably  likely to result in a material adverse effect on
Westvaco, including,  but not limited to, the costs of pollution control
equipment that are  known or anticipated to be required in the future.  
(2) Westvaco and each of the Westvaco subsidiaries have  obtained or have
applied for all Environmental Permits necessary for  the construction of
their facilities or the conduct of their operations  except where the failure
to so obtain would not have a material adverse  effect on Westvaco, and all
such Environmental Permits are in good  standing or, where applicable, a

has no knowledge of any Releases (as  defined in Section 4.1(r)(ii)(4)) of

Westvaco or any of the  Westvaco subsidiaries, or against any person or
entity whose liability  for any Environmental Claim Westvaco or any of the
Westvaco  subsidiaries has or may have retained or assumed either
contractually  or by operation of law except for any Environmental Claims, 
individually or in the aggregate, that would not reasonably likely have  a
material adverse effect on Westvaco.   (s) Opinion of Financial Advisors.

it or any of its subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly through another
person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing
information), or take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries
or the making of any proposal the consummation of which would constitute an
Alternative Transaction (as hereinafter defined) or (ii) participate in any
substantive discussions or negotiations regarding any Alternative
Transaction; provided, however, that (x) if, at any time prior to obtaining
the Mead Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Mead determines in
good faith, after receipt of advice from outside counsel, that the failure to
provide such information or participate in such negotiations or discussions
could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach by Mead\'s Board of
Directors of its fiduciary duties to Mead\'s shareholders under applicable
law and (y) after giving two business days\' notice to Westvaco of its
intention to do so, Mead may, in response to any such proposal that was not
solicited by it and that did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 5.2(a), and subject to compliance with Section 5.2(c), (A) furnish
information with respect to Mead and its subsidiaries to any person pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement containing terms as to
confidentiality generally no less restrictive than the terms of the
confidentiality agreement, dated August 7, 2001, entered into between
Westvaco and Mead (the "Confidentiality Agreement") and (B) participate in
substantive discussions or negotiations regarding such proposal. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Alternative Transaction" means any of (i) a transaction
or series of transactions pursuant to which any person (or group of persons)
other than Westvaco and its subsidiaries and other than Mead and its
subsidiaries (a "Third Party") acquires or would acquire, directly or
indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act) of more than 20% of the outstanding shares of Westvaco or Mead, as the
case may be, whether from Westvaco or Mead or pursuant to a tender offer
or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) any acquisition or proposed
acquisition of Westvaco or any of its significant subsidiaries or Mead or any
of its significant subsidiaries, as the case may be, by a merger or other
business combination (including any so-called "merger of equals" and whether
or not Westvaco or any of its significant subsidiaries or Mead or any of
its significant subsidiaries, as the case may be, is the entity surviving
any such merger or business combination) or (iii) any other
transaction pursuant to which any Third Party acquires or would acquire,
directly or indirectly, control of assets (including for this purpose the
outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of Westvaco or Mead, as the
case may be, and any entity surviving any merger or combination including any
of them) of Westvaco or any of its subsidiaries or Mead or any of its
subsidiaries, as the case may be, for consideration equal to 20% or more of
the fair market value of all of the outstanding shares of Westvaco Common
Stock or all of the outstanding shares of Mead Common Stock, as the case may
be, on the date prior to the date hereof.   (b) Neither the Board of
Directors of Mead nor any committee thereof shall (i) except as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors of Mead that such action is required to
satisfy its fiduciary duties under applicable law or, if in response to a
Mead Superior Proposal, in compliance with the following sentence, withdraw,
qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to Westvaco, the approval or recommendation by such Board of
Directors or such committee of the Mead Merger or this Agreement, (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Alternative Transaction or (iii) cause Mead to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement related to any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that prior to obtaining the Mead Shareholder
Approval, the Board of Directors of Mead determines in good faith, after it
has received a Mead Superior Proposal (as defined below) and after receipt of
advice from outside counsel, that the failure to do so could reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach by the Board of Directors of Mead of its
fiduciary duties to Mead\'s shareholders under applicable law, the Board of
Directors of Mead may (subject to this and the following sentences) inform
Mead\'s shareholders that it no longer believes that the Mead Merger or
this Agreement is advisable and no longer recommends adoption and/or approval
(a "Mead Subsequent Determination"), but only at a time that is after
the fifth business day following Westvaco\'s receipt of written notice from
Mead advising Westvaco that the Board of Directors of Mead has received a
Mead Superior Proposal specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Mead Superior Proposal, identifying the person making such Mead
Superior Proposal and stating that it intends to make a Mead
Subsequent Determination. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Mead Superior
Proposal" means any proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms,
if amended or modified) made by a Third Party to enter into an
Alternative Transaction that has not been solicited or facilitated in breach
of Section 5.2(a) and on terms that the Board of Directors of Mead determines
in its good faith judgment (after obtaining advice from a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable to
Mead\'s shareholders than the Mergers, taking into account all relevant
factors (including (i) whether, in the good faith judgment of the Board
of Directors of Mead, after obtaining advice from a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation, the Third Party is reasonably able
to finance the transaction and (ii) any proposed changes to this
Agreement that may be proposed by Westvaco in response to such
Alternative Transaction). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Mead shall submit this Agreement to its shareholders whether or
not the Board of Directors of Mead makes a Mead Subsequent Determination,
assuming such a shareholder vote would be effective under the OGCL.   (c)
In addition to the obligations of Mead set forth in Sections 5.2(a) and (b),
Mead shall promptly advise Westvaco orally and in writing of any request for
information or of any proposal in connection with an Alternative Transaction,
the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal and the
identity of the person making such request or proposal. Mead shall keep
Westvaco reasonably informed of the status and details (including amendments
or proposed amendments) of any such request or proposal on a current
basis.   (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit Mead
(i) from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
from making any disclosure to its shareholders if, in the good faith judgment
of the Board of Directors of Mead, after receipt of advice from
outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to Mead\'s shareholders under applicable law.   SECTION
5.3 No Solicitation by Westvaco.   (a) Westvaco shall not, nor shall it
permit any of its subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of
its officers, directors or employees or any investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it or any
of its subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly through another person,
(i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing information), or take any other action designed to facilitate,
any inquiries or the making of any proposal the consummation of which
would constitute an Alternative Transaction or (ii) participate in
any substantive discussions or negotiations regarding any
Alternative Transaction; provided, however, that (x) if, at any time prior to
obtaining the Westvaco Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of
Westvaco determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from outside
counsel, that the failure to provide such information or participate in
such negotiations or discussions could reasonably be expected to constitute
a breach by the Board of Directors of Westvaco of its fiduciary duties
to Westvaco\'s stockholders under applicable law and (y) after giving
two business days\' notice to Mead of its intention to do so, Westvaco may,
in response to any such proposal that was not solicited by it and that did
not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.3(a), and subject
to compliance with Section 5.3(c), (A) furnish information with respect
to Westvaco and its subsidiaries to any person pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement containing terms as to confidentiality
generally no less restrictive than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
and (B) participate in substantive discussions and negotiations regarding
such proposal.   (b) Neither the Board of Directors of Westvaco nor any
committee thereof shall (i) except as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors of Westvaco that such action is required to satisfy its
fiduciary duties under applicable law or, if in response to a Westvaco
Superior Proposal, in compliance with the following sentence, withdraw,
qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to Mead, the approval or recommendation by such Board of
Directors or such committee of the Westvaco Merger or this Agreement, (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Alternative Transaction or (iii) cause Westvaco to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement related to any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that prior to obtaining the Westvaco Stockholder
Approval, the Board of Directors of Westvaco determines in good faith, after
it has received a Westvaco Superior Proposal (as defined below) and after
receipt of advice from outside counsel, that the failure to do so could
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach by the Board of Directors of
Westvaco of its fiduciary duties to Westvaco\'s stockholders under applicable
law, the Board of Directors of Westvaco may (subject to this and the
following sentences) inform Westvaco stockholders that it no longer believes
that the Westvaco Merger or this Agreement is advisable and no longer
recommends adoption and/or approval (a "Westvaco Subsequent Determination"),
but only at a time that is after the fifth business day following Mead\'s
receipt of written notice from Westvaco advising Mead that the Board of
Directors of Westvaco has received a Westvaco Superior Proposal, specifying
the material terms and conditions of such Westvaco Superior Proposal,
identifying the person making such Westvaco Superior Proposal and stating
that it intends to make a Westvaco Subsequent Determination. For purposes of
this Agreement, a "Westvaco Superior Proposal" means any proposal (on its
most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a
Third Party to enter into an Alternative Transaction that has not been
solicited or facilitated in breach of Section 5.3(a) and on terms that the
Board of Directors of Westvaco determines in its good faith judgment
(after obtaining advice from a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be more favorable to Westvaco\'s stockholders than
the Mergers, taking into account all relevant factors (including (i)
whether, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Westvaco,
after obtaining advice from a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, the Third Party is reasonably able to finance the
transaction and (ii) any proposed changes to this Agreement that may be
proposed by Mead in response to such Alternative Transaction).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Westvaco shall submit
this Agreement to its stockholders whether or not the Board of Directors of
Westvaco makes a Westvaco Subsequent Determination.   (c) In addition to
the obligations of Westvaco set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
Section 5.3, Westvaco shall promptly advise Mead orally and in writing of any
request for information or of any proposal in connection with an Alternative
Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal
and the identity of the person making such request or proposal. Westvaco
shall keep Mead reasonably informed of the status and details (including
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or proposal on a
current basis.   (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit
Westvaco from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act or (ii) from making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Westvaco, after receipt of
advice from outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to Westvaco\'s stockholders under applicable
law.    ARTICLE VI   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   SECTION 6.1 Preparation of

the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with
the Mergers for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the
SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to Mead or Westvaco, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Mead or Westvaco
that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4
or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
law, disseminated to the stockholders of Mead and Westvaco.   (b) Mead
shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective
under the Securities Act, duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its shareholders (the "Mead Shareholders Meeting") in accordance with the
OGCL for the purpose of obtaining the Mead Shareholder Approval and shall,
subject to the provisions of Section 5.2(b), through its Board of Directors,
recommend to its shareholders the approval and/or adoption of this Agreement,
the Mead Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.   (c)
Westvaco shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared

accordance with the DGCL for the purpose of obtaining the Westvaco
Stockholder Approval and shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.3(b),
through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders the approval
and adoption of this Agreement, the Westvaco Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.   (d) Westvaco and Mead shall use
reasonable best efforts to hold the Mead Shareholders Meeting and the
Westvaco Stockholders Meeting on the same date and as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof.   SECTION 6.2 Access to Information;
Confidentiality.   Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and subject to
applicable law, each of Mead and Westvaco shall, and shall cause each of
its respective subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives of such other party, reasonable access, during
normal business hours during the period from the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time, to all their respective properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel and records (provided that such access
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of such
party), and during such period, each of Mead and Westvaco shall, and shall
cause each of its respective subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other
party all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
such other party may reasonably request. No review pursuant to this Section
6.2 shall affect any representation or warranty given by the other party
hereto. Each of Mead and Westvaco shall hold, and shall cause its respective
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information
in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.   SECTION
6.3 Reasonable Best Efforts.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties
in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities, including any required action or non-
action under the Antitrust Laws (the "Required Consents") prior to the
Effective Time, and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and
the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain a Required Consent
from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii)
the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers, and
any necessary or appropriate financing arrangements, from third parties,
(iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have
any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or
other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution
and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
each party hereto agrees to make (i) an appropriate filing of a Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, (ii) appropriate filings, if any are required, pursuant to the EC
Merger Regulation and/or other foreign regulatory authorities in accordance
with applicable Foreign Laws, and (iii) all other necessary filings with
other Governmental Entities relating to the Merger, and, in each case, to
supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be formally or informally requested pursuant to
the Antitrust Laws or by such authorities and to use reasonable best efforts
to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods
under the Antitrust Laws and the receipt of the Required Consents as soon
as practicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither Mead nor Westvaco shall be required to hold separate
(including by trust or otherwise) or divest any of its businesses or assets
or enter into any consent decree or other agreement that would restrict it in
the conduct of its business as heretofore conducted if such action is
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Parent (after giving
effect to the Mergers), including a material adverse effect on the total
benefits expected to be realized by Parent after completion of the
Mergers.   (b) Each of the parties will consult and cooperate with
one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf
of any party, hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to
any Antitrust Law. Each of the parties will (i) promptly notify the other
party of any communication received by that party from, or given by it to,
any Governmental Entity and, subject to applicable law, if practicable,
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written
communication to any such Governmental Entity and incorporate the other
party*s reasonable comments, (ii) not agree to participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger
unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and (iii) furnish the other
party with copies of all correspondence, filings and written
communications between them and their affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, consultants,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other agents on one hand, and
any such Governmental Entity or its respective staff on the other hand, with

effect on the date hereof (pursuant to an indemnification agreement or
otherwise), with respect to any claim, liability, loss, damage, cost or
expense (whenever asserted or claimed) based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, any matter existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the Westvaco
Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect for not less than six years
after the Effective Time the current policies of directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance maintained by Westvaco on the date hereof; provided,
however, that Parent or the Westvaco Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies having at least the same coverage and containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous to the persons currently
covered by such policies as insured) with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; and provided, further, that if
the aggregate annual premiums for such policies at any time during such
period will exceed 150% of the per annum premium rate paid by Westvaco and
its subsidiaries as of the date hereof for such policies, then Parent shall,
or shall cause the Westvaco Surviving Corporation to, provide only
such coverage as will then be available at an annual premium equal to 150%
of such rate (or, if greater, the amount paid for insurance pursuant
to Section 6.4(b)).   (b) Parent agrees that at all times after the
Effective Time, it shall indemnify, or shall cause the Mead Surviving

or otherwise), with respect to any claim, liability, loss, damage, cost
or expense (whenever asserted or claimed) based in whole or in part on,
or arising in whole or in part out of, any matter existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the

6.4(a)).   SECTION 6.5 Fees and Expenses.   Except as set forth in this
Section 6.5 and in Section 8.2, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Mergers, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not the Mergers are consummated, except that each of Westvaco and Mead
shall bear and pay one-half of the costs and expenses (other than the fees

Mead and Westvaco shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the
other party, unless such consent will have been unreasonably

efforts to consult with the other party.   SECTION 6.7 Affiliates.   As
soon as practicable after the date hereof, each of Westvaco and Mead shall
deliver to the other a letter identifying all persons who may be deemed to
be, at the time this Agreement is submitted for approval and adoption by
stockholders, "affiliates" of it for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act, and such list shall be updated as necessary to
reflect changes from the date hereof. Each of Westvaco and Mead shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause each person identified on its list
to deliver to the other, on or before the date immediately preceding the
date of filing the Form S-4, a written agreement substantially in the
form attached as Exhibit D and, in the event any other person becomes
an affiliate of it thereafter, to cause such person to deliver such
an agreement to the other as soon as practicable but in any event at
the Closing.   SECTION 6.8 NYSE Listing.   Mead shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock issuable under Article III to be

opinions of counsel referred to in Sections 7.2(d) and 7.3(d). None of Mead,
Westvaco or any of their respective subsidiaries shall take any action, or
allow any affiliate to take any action, reasonably likely to preclude any of

similar statute or regulation is or may become applicable to the transactions

Board of Directors shall (i) grant such approvals and take all such actions

become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the
Effective Time. Westvaco and Mead shall pay on behalf of those persons
holding Westvaco Common Stock and Mead Common Stock, respectively,

Mead Disclosure Schedule, (ii) Parent shall cause Mead to honor all
agreements and commitments listed in Sections 6.12(a)(i)(B) and 6.12(a)(i)(C)
of the Mead Disclosure Schedule, and (iii) Parent shall assume and honor
all Westvaco Stock Plans and all Mead Stock Plans, taking such actions as
are necessary to ensure that shares of Parent Common Stock may be subject
to awards granted under such plans. The foregoing shall not be construed
to prevent the termination of employment of any Employee (as defined below)
or the amendment or termination of any particular Mead Benefit Plan
or Westvaco Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by its terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time.   (b) For all purposes under
the employee benefit plans of Parent and its affiliates providing benefits to
any current or former director, officer or employee of Mead or Westvaco or
any of their respective affiliates, as the case may be (each an "Employee")
after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), and subject to applicable law and
obligations under applicable collective bargaining agreements, each Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with Mead or Westvaco or
any of their respective affiliates, as the case may be, before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Mead Benefit
Plans or Westvaco Benefit Plans, as applicable, except to the extent such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to applicable
law and obligations under applicable collective bargaining agreements: (i)
each Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans which are welfare benefit plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a
comparable Mead Benefit Plan or Westvaco Benefit Plan, as applicable, in
which such Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
any Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date such Employee\'s participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.   (c) The parties agree that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in the case of Westvaco) and
the shareholder approval of this Agreement (in the case of Mead)
shall constitute a "Change in Control" for all purposes of all compensation
and benefit plans of Westvaco and Mead (except for any tax-qualified
defined benefit pension plan of Mead). The parties further agree that for
purposes of this Section 6.12(c), the term "Change in Control" shall include
all equivalent terms as required by context (by way of illustration and
not limitation, "Significant Change").   (d) Mead shall take (or cause to
be taken) such actions with respect to benefit matters as are set forth in
Section 6.12(d) of the Mead Disclosure Schedule.   (e) Mead shall take (or
shall cause to be taken) such actions as are necessary to assure that no
funding of any Mead grantor trust is required to occur in connection with the
execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.   (f) Mead shall amend its 2001 Annual Incentive Plan,
its Long Term Incentive Plan covering 2000-2001 and its Long Term Incentive
Plan covering 2001-2002 to change the respective pro-rata payments of the
then current target incentives which would otherwise become payable upon a
Change in Control to pro-rata payments based on the level of actual
achievement of the respective performance goals through the Effective
Time.   (g) Parent shall cause Mead to continue to provide retiree
medical benefits to Mead employees who meet the requirements for such
benefits, in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof in effect as of
the date hereof, until at least the first anniversary of the Effective Time.
During such one-year period the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer
shall discuss the retiree medical benefits program in good faith, seeking
to agree on the most appropriate long-term approach to such benefits.  
SECTION 6.13 Consents of Accountants.   Mead and Westvaco shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to each other consents from
their respective independent auditors, dated the date on which the Form S-4
will become effective, in form reasonably satisfactory to the recipient and
customary in scope and substance for consents delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements on Form S-4 under the
Securities Act.   SECTION 6.14 Rights Agreements.   (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, Mead shall not redeem the Mead Rights, or amend, modify
(other than to delay any "distribution date" therein or to render the Mead
Rights inapplicable to the Merger or any action permitted under this
Agreement) or terminate the Mead Rights Agreement, unless required to do so
by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.   (b) Prior to the Effective
Time, Westvaco shall not redeem the Westvaco Rights or amend, modify (other
than to delay any "distribution date" therein or to render the Westvaco
Rights inapplicable to the Merger or any action permitted under this
Agreement) or terminate the Westvaco Rights Agreement, unless required to do
so by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.   SECTION 6.15 Transfer
Statutes.   Each of Mead and Westvaco agrees to use reasonable best efforts
to comply promptly with all requirements of state property transfer
statutes to the extent applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to take all actions necessary to cause the transactions
contemplated hereby to be effected in compliance with such statutes. Mead and
Westvaco agree that they will consult with each other to determine what, if
any, actions must be taken prior to or after the Effective Time to
ensure compliance with such statutes. Each of Mead and Westvaco agrees to
provide the other with any documents to be submitted to the relevant state
agencies prior to submission.   SECTION 6.16 Section 16(b).   Mead and
Westvaco shall take all such steps as are reasonably necessary to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of
equity securities of Mead or Westvaco (including derivative securities) or
acquisitions of equity securities of Parent (including derivative securities)
in connection herewith by any individual who (a) is a director or officer of
Mead or Westvaco or (b), at the Effective Time, will become a director or
officer of Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.   SECTION 6.17 Payment of Dividends.   (a) From the date of
the Agreement until the Effective Time, Westvaco and Mead shall coordinate
with each other regarding the declaration of dividends in respect of the
shares of Westvaco Common Stock and the shares of Mead Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of
the parties that holders of shares of Westvaco Common Stock or Mead Common
Stock will not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for
any single calendar quarter with respect to their shares of Westvaco Common
Stock or Mead Common Stock and the shares of Parent Common Stock any holder
of shares of Westvaco Common Stock or Mead Common Stock receives in exchange
therefor in connection with the Mergers.   (b) It is the intention of Mead
and Westvaco that the initial annual dividend rate on the shares of Parent
Common Stock following the Mergers shall be $0.92 per share.   SECTION 6.18

from holders of Westvaco Common Stock at least 800,000 shares of Westvaco
Common Stock, such repurchases to be made at such times prior to the
Effective Time and upon such terms as determined by Westvaco.   SECTION
6.20 Parent Taxable Year.   Mead, Westvaco and Parent confirm their
intention to seek to have the taxable year of Parent immediately after the
Mergers be, for federal income tax purposes, the year ending on December 31
of each year. In furtherance of the foregoing, Mead, Westvaco and Parent
shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to, cooperate and consider
in good faith taking appropriate actions (including seeking a ruling or
other confirmation from the Internal Revenue Service) necessary to ensure
that, for federal income tax purposes, the taxable year of Parent
immediately after the Mergers shall be the year ending on December 31 of each
year.    ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT   SECTION 7.1 Conditions to
