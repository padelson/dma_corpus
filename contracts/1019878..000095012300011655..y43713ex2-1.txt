PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 17, 2000 (including any schedule and
exhibit hereto, this "Agreement"), by and among VNU N.V., a corporation
organized under the laws of the Netherlands ("Parent"), ARTIST ACQUISITION,
INC., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Purchaser"), and ACNIELSEN CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"):   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company have each determined that it would be
advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders for
Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, to effectuate the acquisition, it
is proposed that Purchaser commence a cash tender offer to purchase all of
the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share
(the "Common Stock"), of the Company, including the associated Preferred
Share Purchase Rights (the "Rights" and, together with the Common Stock, the
"Shares") issued pursuant to a Rights Agreement, dated as of October 17,
1996, between the Company and First Chicago Trust Company of New York (the
"Rights Agreement"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and the Offer Documents (as defined in Section 1.02(a));  
WHEREAS, to effectuate the acquisition, it is further proposed that following
consummation of the Offer (as defined in Section 1.01(a)), Purchaser will be
merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the
surviving corporation in such merger (the "Merger");   WHEREAS, the Board of
Directors of the Company has, by the unanimous vote of all directors (a)
determined that the Offer and the Merger are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders; (b) approved this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger,
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL"); and (c) declared the advisability of this Agreement and resolved to
recommend that the holders of the Shares accept the Offer and adopt this
Agreement; and   WHEREAS, certain executive officers as set forth on
Schedule A to this Agreement (together, the "Executive Employees") have
executed and delivered concurrently with, and as a condition to the execution
of this Agreement, agreements (the "Executive Agreements") which include,
among other things, non-competition and non-solicitation provisions;   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and other terms contained in this Agreement, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:  9 
ARTICLE I   THE OFFER   SECTION 1.01 The Offer. (a) Provided that none of
the events set forth in Exhibit A hereto shall have occurred and be
continuing, on the fifth Business Day (as defined in Section 9.02(b)) after
the public announcement by Parent and the Company of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement (counting the Business Day on which such
announcement is made), Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together
with the rules and regulations thereunder, the "Exchange Act")), an offer
(the "Offer") to purchase all of the outstanding Shares, at a price of $36.75
per Share, net to the seller in cash (as paid pursuant to the Offer, the
"Offer Consideration"). The obligation of Parent and Purchaser to commence
the Offer, to consummate the Offer and to accept for payment and pay for
Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn shall be subject to
the conditions set forth in Exhibit A hereto.   (b) On the terms and subject
to the prior satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Offer, Parent
shall provide, or cause to be provided, funds to Purchaser and Purchaser
shall accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration
date thereof.   (c) Without the prior written consent of the
Company, Purchaser shall not (i) change the form of the Offer Consideration
paid; (ii) decrease the Offer Consideration; (iii) decrease the number of
Shares sought pursuant to the Offer; (iv) extend the expiration date of the
Offer beyond the initial expiration date of the Offer (which shall be the
20th Business Day after commencement of the Offer), except (A) as required by
applicable law or by any rule or regulation of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC "), or (B) that if, immediately prior to the
expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended), the Shares tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer constitute at least 80% but less than 90%
of the outstanding Shares, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, extend the
Offer for one or more periods not to exceed an aggregate of five Business
Days, notwithstanding that all conditions to the Offer are satisfied as of
such expiration date of the Offer, or (C) that if any condition to the Offer
has not been satisfied or waived, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion,
extend the expiration date of the Offer for one or more periods (not in
excess of ten Business Days each) but in no event later than June 30, 2001;
(v) waive the condition (the "Minimum Condition ") that there shall have been
validly tendered and not withdrawn immediately prior to the time the Offer
expires such number of Shares which, together with the Shares then owned by
Parent, would constitute at least a majority of the Shares outstanding on a
fully-diluted basis on the date of purchase ("on a fully-diluted
basis" meaning the number of Shares outstanding, together with the Shares
which the Company may be required to issue pursuant to warrants, Stock
Options (as defined in Section 2.08) or obligations outstanding at that date
under employee stock or similar benefit plans or otherwise whether or not
vested or then exercisable); (vi) waive the condition relating to the
expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act") and, if required, under the
Competition Act (Canada) and the rules and regulations thereunder (the
"CAC"), the condition relating to the issuance of a decision under Article
6(1)(b) or 8(2) of Council Regulation No. 4064/89 of the   2  10 European
Community, as amended (the "EC Merger Regulation"), or the condition relating
to the non-termination of this Agreement; (vii) amend any term or
other condition of the Offer in any manner adverse to holders of Shares; or
(viii) impose any additional condition to the Offer; provided, however, that,
except as set forth above and subject to applicable legal requirements,
Purchaser may waive any condition to the Offer in its sole discretion; and
provided further that the Offer may be extended in connection with an
increase in the consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer so as to
comply with applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. If the Offer shall
not have been consummated at the scheduled expiration thereof due to the
failure to satisfy (i) any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in clause
(e)(i) or (e)(iv) of Exhibit A, (ii) the condition to the Offer relating to
the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act and, if required, the
CAC, or (iii) the condition relating to the issuance of a decision under
Article 6(1)(b) or 8(2) of the EC Merger Regulation, Parent will, at the
request of the Company, cause Purchaser to extend the expiration date of the
Offer for one or more periods (not in excess of ten Business Days each) but
in no event later than June 30, 2001. If the Offer shall not have been
consummated at the scheduled expiration thereof due to the failure to satisfy
the condition relating to the Central Works\' Council of Parent (as defined
in Section 1.04(c)) (the "Works\' Council") set forth in clause (c) of
Exhibit A, Parent will, at the request of the Company, cause Purchaser to
extend the expiration date of the Offer for one or more periods (not in
excess of ten Business Days each) but in no event later than September 30,
2001.   SECTION 1.02 Offer Documents. (a) As promptly as
reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and
Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall
contain or shall incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (the "Offer to
Purchase") and forms of the related letter of transmittal and any related
summary advertisement (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such other
ancillary documents, together with all supplements, instruments and
amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the "Offer
Documents"). The Company will promptly supply to Parent and Purchaser in
writing, for inclusion in the Offer Documents, all information concerning the
Company required under the Exchange Act to be included in the Offer
Documents.   (b) Each of Parent and Purchaser further agrees to take
all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and
to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. Each of Parent, Purchaser and
the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by them for use
in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall be or
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and
Purchaser shall take all lawful action necessary to cause the Offer Documents
as so corrected to be filed promptly with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable law. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Offer Documents and any amendments thereto prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and
its counsel any comments Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the
receipt of such comments.   3  11  SECTION 1.03 Company Actions. (a) The
Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents and
warrants that (i) its Board of Directors (at a meeting duly called and held
on December 17, 2000) has by the unanimous vote of all directors (A)
determined that each of this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger are fair to
and in the best interests of the Company\'s stockholders, (B) approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, and such approval is sufficient to render the restrictions on
"business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) set forth in
Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and (C) declared the
advisability of this Agreement and resolved to recommend acceptance of the
Offer and adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Shares; provided,
however, that prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Board of Directors
of the Company may modify, withdraw or change such recommendation to the
extent that the Board of Directors, after receiving advice from
outside counsel, concludes in good faith that such action is reasonably
necessary in order for the Board of Directors to act in a manner consistent
with the Board\'s fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (ii) Evercore
Group Inc. has delivered to the Board of Directors of the Company its opinion
that the Offer Consideration to be received by the holders of Shares in the
Offer and the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents
of the recommendation of the Board described in the immediately preceding
sentence. The Company has been advised by its directors and executive
officers that they either intend to tender all Shares beneficially owned by
them to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or, if applicable, vote all such
Shares in favor of the Merger.   (b) The Company shall file with the SEC, as
promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer,
a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing
the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company in favor of the
Offer and the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, provided, however, that prior to the
consummation of the Offer, the Board of Directors of the Company may modify,
withdraw or change such recommendation to the extent that the Board of
Directors, after receiving advice from outside counsel, concludes in good
faith that such action is reasonably necessary in order for the Board of
Directors to act in a manner consistent with the Board\'s fiduciary duties
under applicable law. Each of Parent and Purchaser will promptly supply to
the Company in writing, for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9, all information
concerning the Parent Designees (as defined in Section 1.04(a) hereof), as
required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder, and
the Company shall include such information in the Schedule 14D-9. Parent will
promptly supply to the Company in writing, for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9, any information concerning Parent or Purchaser required under the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder to be included in the
Schedule 14D-9. The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary
to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser
shall promptly correct any information provided by them for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall be or have
become false or misleading in any material respect and the Company shall take
all lawful action necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed promptly with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares as and
to the extent required by applicable law. Parent, Purchaser and their   4 
12 counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof
with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel any
comments the Company or its counsel receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments.  
(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish Parent
and Purchaser with mailing labels, security position listings and all
available listings or computer files containing the names and addresses
of the record holders of Shares as of the latest practicable date and shall
furnish Parent and Purchaser with such information and assistance (including
updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of security
positions) as Parent and Purchaser or their agents may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares.  
SECTION 1.04 Directors. (a) Promptly after the purchase of and payment for
the Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be entitled to
designate such number of directors (the "Parent Designees"), rounded up to
the next whole number, on the Company\'s Board of Directors as is equal
to the product of the total number of directors on such Board (after giving
effect to any increase in the size of such Board pursuant to this Section
1.04) multiplied by the percentage that the number of Shares beneficially
owned by Purchaser at such time (including Shares so accepted for payment)
bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding; provided that, in the
event the Minimum Condition shall have been satisfied, in no event shall the
Parent Designees constitute less than a majority of the entire Board of
Directors. In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon the request of
Parent, use its reasonable best efforts promptly either to increase the size
of its Board of Directors or to secure the resignations of such number of its
incumbent directors, or both, as is necessary to enable the Parent Designees
to be so elected or appointed to the Company\'s Board of Directors, and the
Company shall take all actions available to the Company to cause the Parent
Designees to be so elected or appointed. At such time, the Company shall, if
requested by Parent, also take all action necessary to cause persons
designated by Parent to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up
to the next whole number) as is on the Company\'s Board of Directors of (i)
each committee of the Company\'s Board of Directors, (ii) each board of
directors (or similar body) of each Subsidiary (as defined in Section 9.02)
of the Company and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each
such board.   (b) The Company\'s obligation to appoint Parent Designees
to the Company\'s Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall
promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations
under Section 1.04(a), including mailing to stockholders the information
required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 (or including such information
in the Schedule 14D-9 initially filed with the SEC and distributed to the
stockholders of the Company) as is necessary to enable Parent Designees to be
elected to the Company\'s Board of Directors. Parent or Purchaser will supply
to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with
respect to Parent and Purchaser and their nominees, officers, directors and
affiliates to the extent required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The
provisions of this Section 1.04 are in addition to and shall not limit any
rights which Purchaser, Parent or any of their affiliates may have as a
holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable law with
respect to the election of directors or otherwise.   5  13  (c)
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.04, the parties hereto shall
use their respective best efforts to ensure that at least two of the members
of the Board shall, at all times prior to the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 2.03), be directors of the Company who were directors of the Company
on the date hereof (the "Continuing Directors"), provided that, if there
shall be in office fewer than two Continuing Directors for any reason,
the Board of Directors shall cause the person designated by the remaining
Continuing Director to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be a
Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement, or if no Continuing
Directors then remain, the other directors of the Company then in office
shall designate two persons to fill such vacancies who will not be officers
or employees or affiliates of the Company or Parent or any of their
respective subsidiaries and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing
Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. From and after the time, if
any, that the Parent Designees constitute a majority of the Company\'s Board
of Directors and prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms hereof,
any amendment or modification of this Agreement, any amendment to the
Company\'s restated certificate of incorporation or by-laws, any
termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension of time for
performance of any of the obligations of Parent or Purchaser hereunder, any
waiver of any condition to the Company\'s obligations hereunder or any of the
Company\'s rights hereunder or other action by the Company hereunder which
adversely affects the holders of Shares other than Parent or Purchaser may be
effected only if there are in office one or more Continuing Directors and
such action is approved by the action of unanimous vote of the entire Board
of Directors of the Company.   ARTICLE II   THE MERGER   SECTION 2.01
The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, the Merger shall be effected and
Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At

laws of the State of Delaware.   SECTION 2.02 Closing. Unless this Agreement
shall have been terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
have been abandoned pursuant to Article VIII, and subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") will take place as soon as practicable, but in no
event later than 10:00 a.m. on the second Business Day (the "Closing Date")

York, New York 10022, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto.   SECTION 2.03 Effective Time. On the Closing
Date (or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree), the parties
hereto shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a
certificate of merger or, if applicable, a certificate of ownership and
merger (in either case, the "Certificate of Merger") and any other
appropriate documents,   6  14 executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings or recordings in
such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the DGCL and
other applicable law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as is mutually agreed
by the parties and set forth therein (the "Effective Time").   SECTION 2.04
Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Company and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.   SECTION 2.05 Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws. (a) At
the Effective Time, subject to Section 6.08(a), the restated certificate
of incorporation of the Company shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended in accordance
with the provisions thereof and applicable law.   (b) The by-laws of the
Company shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable
law.   SECTION 2.06 Directors; Officers. From and after the Effective Time,
(a) the directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of
(i) their resignation or removal or (ii) the time at which their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be, and
(b) the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of
(i) their resignation or removal or (ii) the time at which their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.   SECTION
2.07 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any
holder of Shares or any other shares of capital stock of the Company or
Purchaser:   (a) Common Stock of Purchaser. Each share of common  stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding  immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and  become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common  stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury
Shares and Parent-Owned  Shares. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the  Effective Time that is owned by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the  Company or by Parent, Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of
Parent  (other than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts, custodial 
accounts and the like that are beneficially owned by third parties)  shall
automatically be   7  15  canceled and shall cease to exist, and no cash
or other consideration  shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor.   (c) Conversion of Shares. Each Share issued and  outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares  to be canceled in
accordance with Section 2.07(b) and any Dissenting  Shares (as defined in
Section 2.07(d)) shall be converted into the  right to receive the Offer
Consideration, payable to the holder  thereof, without any interest thereon
(the "Merger Consideration"),  less any required withholding Taxes (as
defined in Section 3.14(b)),  upon surrender and exchange of a Certificate
(as defined in Section  2.09(b)).   (d) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding
anything in this  Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding
immediately  prior to the Effective Time held by any person who, if
applicable, has  not voted such Shares in favor of the Merger and who has the
right to  demand, and who properly demands, an appraisal of such Shares 
("Dissenting Shares") in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (or  any
successor provision) shall not be converted into a right to receive  the
Merger Consideration unless such holder fails to perfect or  otherwise loses
such holder\'s right to such appraisal, if any. If,  after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect or loses any  such right to appraisal,
each such Share of such holder shall be  treated as a Share that had been
converted as of the Effective Time  into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with  Section 2.07(c). At the Effective Time, any
holder of Dissenting Shares  shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights  provided in Section 262 of the DGCL (or any
successor provision) and as  provided in the immediately preceding sentence.
The Company shall give  prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for  appraisal of Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other  instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received
by  the Company. Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct 
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The  Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,  make any payment
with respect to, or offer to settle, any such demands.   SECTION 2.08
Options; Stock Plans. (a) Each outstanding option to purchase Shares (a
"Stock Option") which immediately prior to the Effective Time is not vested
will accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable upon the Effective
Time in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option Plan
(the "Accelerated Stock Options"). As of the Effective Time, each Stock
Option (including the Accelerated Stock Options) shall be canceled by
the Company and in consideration of such cancellation, the Company shall pay
to each holder of a canceled Stock Option at the Effective Time an amount
(the "Option Spread") equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of (i)
the Merger Consideration over (ii) the exercise price per Share of such Stock
Option multiplied by (B) the number of Shares subject to such Stock Option
immediately prior to its cancellation. The Option Spread, after reduction for
any required withholding Taxes, shall be paid in cash as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time.   (b) As of the Effective Time,
(i) each then outstanding deferred share unit issued under the Directors\'
Deferred Compensation Plan shall be cancelled and in consideration   8 
16 of such cancellation, the holder of such deferred share unit shall receive
as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time a cash payment equal
to the number of deferred share units then held by such holder, multiplied by
the Merger Consideration, (ii) each deferred cash account established under
the Directors\' Deferred Compensation Plan shall be cancelled and in
consideration of such cancellation, the participant in whose name the
deferred cash account is established shall receive as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time a cash payment equal to the balance in such
deferred cash account and (iii) each then outstanding share of restricted
stock issued under the Directors\' Plan shall be cancelled and in
consideration of such cancellation, the holder of such shares of restricted
stock shall receive as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time a
cash payment equal to the number of shares of restricted stock then held by
such holder, multiplied by the Merger Consideration.   (c) The Company shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that following the Effective Time no
holder of a Stock Option or any participant in any employee incentive or
benefit plans or programs or arrangements or non-employee director plans
maintained by the Company shall have any right thereunder to acquire any
capital stock of Parent or the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 2.09 Payment
for Shares. (a) Payment Fund. Concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with or for the account of a
bank or trust company designated by Parent, which shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the
holders of Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable upon the conversion of Shares pursuant to Section
2.07(c) (the "Payment Fund").   (b) Letters of Transmittal; Surrender of
Certificates. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record
(other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent, Purchaser or
any other Subsidiary of Parent) of a certificate or certificates that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, evidenced outstanding Shares (the
"Certificates"), (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in
an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate and (ii) the Merger Consideration, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on any cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. If
payment is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person
other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate, or establish
to the satisfaction of Parent and the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.   9  17  (c) Cancellation of
Shares; No Further Rights. As of the Effective Time, all Shares (other than
Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.07(b)) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto or arising therefrom (including without limitation the right to
vote), except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest, upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
Section 2.09(b), and until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(without interest), other than in the case of Dissenting Shares. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Section 2.09 shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates. At the close of business on the day of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company.   (d) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying
Agent shall invest the Payment Fund, as directed by Parent, in (i) direct
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper rated "A-1"
or "P-1" or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s
Corporation, respectively, or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers\' acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $500 million. Any net earnings with respect to the Payment Fund
shall be the property of and paid over to Parent as and when requested by
Parent.   (e) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for 180 days after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of Certificates that have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.09
shall thereafter look only to Parent, and only as general creditors thereof,
for payment of their claim for any Merger Consideration.   (f) No Liability.
None of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any person in respect of any payments or distributions
payable from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Subject to applicable
law and public policy, if any Certificates shall not have been surrendered
prior to three years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity
(as defined in Section 3.03(b))), any amounts payable in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law and public
policy, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   (g)
Withholding Rights. Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause to be deducted or withheld, from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Stock
Options or Certificates such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of applicable
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld, such   10  18 deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holders in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.   ARTICLE III  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   As an inducement to Parent
and the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, except as set forth in the
corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure schedule delivered by
the Company to Parent and Purchaser upon or prior to entering into this
Agreement (the "Disclosure Schedule"), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Purchaser as follows:   SECTION 3.01 Organization, Standing and
Corporate Power. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
incorporated (or if not a corporation, duly organized), validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
incorporated and has the requisite corporate or other power and authority to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. For purposes
of this Agreement, a "Material Adverse Effect" with respect to any person
means a material adverse effect on (a) the ability of such person to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or (b) the financial condition, business or results of
operations of such person and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than
any change, circumstance or effect relating to (i) the economy or securities
markets in general, (ii) the industries in which such person operates and not
specifically relating to such person, (iii) the performance of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or (iv) any development relating to the action commenced
by Information Resources, Inc. on July 29, 1996 in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants The Dun and
Bradstreet Corporation, A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of the Company)
and I.M.S. International, Inc., and any related proceedings. The Company has
delivered or made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws or comparable governing

B, all Subsidiaries of the Company required to be so reported are wholly
owned directly or indirectly by the Company. The Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other equity interest in any
person other than the Subsidiaries other than such capital stock and other
equity interests with a carrying value, in the aggregate, not in excess
of $1,000,000.   SECTION 3.02 Corporate Authorization. The Company has
the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to

19 contemplated hereby have been duly authorized, and this Agreement has
been approved, by the Board of Directors of the Company, and no other
corporate proceeding, other than with respect to the Merger the approval of
the Company\'s stockholders, is necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming that this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms. Subject to the applicability of Section 253 of the DGCL, the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares is
the only vote required to adopt this Agreement and consummate the Merger.

governmental filings and other matters referred to in Section
3.03(b), violate or result in a breach of or default (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a material obligation,
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss
of a material benefit under, or require the consent of any person under,
any indenture or other agreement, permit, concession, franchise, license or
other instrument or undertaking to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or

Company.   (b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of,

foreign court, arbitral tribunal, administrative agency or commission or
other governmental agency or regulatory authority (a "Governmental Entity"),

Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company has received the written opinion of
Evercore Group Inc., dated December 17, 2000 (a true, correct and complete
copy of which will be promptly delivered to Parent by the Company), to the
effect that, based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein and as
of the date thereof, the Offer Consideration and the Merger Consideration to
be received by the holders of Shares (other than Parent and Purchaser) in the
Offer and the Merger, respectively, is fair, from a financial point of view,
to such holders, and such opinion has not been withdrawn or modified.  
SECTION 3.18 Voting Requirements. In the event that Section 253 of the DGCL
is inapplicable and unavailable to effectuate the Merger, the affirmative
vote of the    24  32 holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares

this Agreement is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the
Company\'s capital stock or other securities required in connection with the

contemplated hereby to be consummated by the Company. The Board of Directors
has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on "business
combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) set forth in Section

defined in the Rights Agreement), by reason of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions to be effected
pursuant to this Agreement, and (b) the Rights will expire immediately prior
to the consummation of the Offer. The Rights Amendment is sufficient
to render the Rights inoperative with respect to (i) the acquisition of

Amendment has been delivered or made available to Parent.   SECTION 3.20

contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. A complete and accurate copy of
the Evercore Group Inc. engagement letter has been provided or made available
to Parent.   SECTION 3.21 Executive Agreements. The Executive
Agreements are in full force and effect. There has been no breach of, or
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become
a default) under the Executive Agreements which would give to others any
right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of the
Executive Agreements.   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

which the nature of its business or the ownership or     25  33 leasing

such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent or Purchaser, taken as a whole. Parent has delivered
or made available to the Company complete and correct copies of the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or equivalent organizational

corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Purchaser are necessary to
authorize this Agreement, or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent
and Purchaser and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each
of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable against each such party in accordance

their respective assets is bound or affected other than the Positive Advice
or Acceptable Conditional Advice of the Works\' Council (each as defined in

SECTION 6.01 Company Stockholders Meeting; Proxy Statement; Merger. (a) As
soon as practicable following the acceptance for payment of and payment for
Shares by Purchaser in the Offer, if required by law to consummate the
Merger, the Company shall with the cooperation of Parent take all
action necessary, in accordance with the DGCL, the Exchange Act     
30  38 and other applicable law and its restated certificate of
incorporation and by-laws, to convene and hold a special meeting of the
stockholders of the Company (the "Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of
considering and voting upon the adoption of this Agreement and to solicit
proxies pursuant to the Proxy Statement in connection therewith. The Board of
Directors of the Company shall recommend that the holders of Shares vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting and shall
cause such recommendation to be included in the Proxy Statement. At the
Stockholders Meeting, Parent and Purchaser shall cause all of the Shares
owned by them to be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.   (b)
The Company, if requested by Parent, shall promptly prepare and file with the
SEC a proxy statement (together with any supplement or amendment thereto, the

the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Parent, Purchaser
and the Company will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement, and the Company shall notify Parent of the receipt of any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any requests
by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional
information and shall provide to Parent promptly copies of all correspondence
between the Company or any representative of the Company and the SEC. Parent
and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Proxy Statement, including all amendments and supplements thereto,
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to
provide Parent and Purchaser and its counsel any comments the Company or its
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement promptly after receipt of such comments. Without limiting the
generality or effect of the foregoing, the Company shall use its best efforts
to respond to all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement and,
subject to compliance with SEC rules and regulations, to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s stockholders at the earliest
practicable date. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall promptly supply to the
Company in writing, for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, all information
concerning Parent and Purchaser required under the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder to be included in the Proxy Statement.   (c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), in the event that
Purchaser shall acquire ownership of at least 90% of the outstanding Shares
upon consummation of the Offer, Purchaser and Parent shall take all necessary
actions to cause the Merger to become effective, as soon as practicable after
the expiration of the Offer, without a meeting of stockholders of the
Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.   SECTION 6.02 Access
to Information; Notification of Certain Matters. (a) Subject to the
provisions of any confidentiality agreement by which the Company is bound
(provided that the Company shall advise Parent that information is not being
provided as a result thereof and whether such information, in the good faith
belief of the Company, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company), the Company shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its officers, employees,
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives prompt, reasonable
access during the period prior to the Effective Time to all of the Company\'s
and its Subsidiaries\' properties, books, contracts, commitments, Returns,
personnel and records, and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish as promptly as practicable to
Parent such information concerning the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
businesses, properties, financial    31  39 condition, operations and
personnel as Parent may from time to time reasonably request. Any such
investigation by Parent shall not affect the representations or warranties of
the Company contained in this Agreement. Parent will hold any information
provided under this Section 6.02 that is nonpublic in confidence to the
extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
letter dated December 8, 2000 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between the
Company and Parent.   (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of
(i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event which would cause any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
any material failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, in
either case which would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions
set forth in clause (e)(iii), (e)(iv) or (e)(v) of Exhibit A hereto to fail
to be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 6.02(b) shall not limit or otherwise affect the rights or
remedies available hereunder to Parent; provided further that this Section
6.02 shall not constitute a covenant or agreement for the purpose of Section
8.01(e)(v) or clause (e)(iii) of Exhibit A hereto.   SECTION 6.03
Reasonable Best Efforts. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 6.05 hereof, each
of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including the satisfaction of the respective conditions set forth in Article
VII.   SECTION 6.04 Public Announcements. Parent and Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release, SEC filing (including the Offer Documents,
the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement) or other public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable
law, by court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with any securities exchange.   SECTION 6.05 No Solicitation. (a) From the
date hereof, the Company shall not (whether directly or indirectly through
advisors, agents or other intermediaries), and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its respective officers, directors,
advisors, representatives and other agents of the Company not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiries
relating to, or the submission of, any Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter
defined), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal, or, in connection with any Acquisition Proposal,
furnish to any person any information or data with respect to or access to
the properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or take any other
action to facilitate the making of any proposal that constitutes or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter
into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or
resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal; provided that, prior to
consummation of the Offer, if the Board of Directors of the     32 
40 Company, after receiving advice from outside counsel, has concluded in
good faith that such action is reasonably necessary for the Board of
Directors to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, then the Company may furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Acquisition Proposal, in which case the Company will not
disclose any information to such person without entering into a
confidentiality agreement substantially identical to the Confidentiality
Agreement (it being understood that the Company may enter into a
confidentiality agreement without a standstill or with a standstill provision
less favorable to the Company if it waives or similarly modifies
the standstill provision in the Confidentiality Agreement). The Company
shall promptly (but in no case later than 24 hours after receipt) provide
Parent with a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal received and a written
statement with respect to any non-written Acquisition Proposal received,
which statement shall include the identity of the parties making the
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms thereof. The Company shall keep
Parent informed on a current basis of the status and content of any
discussions regarding any Acquisition Proposal with a third party. Nothing
contained in this Section 6.05 prohibit the Company or the Company\'s Board
of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communications in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any disclosure
required by applicable law or, prior to the consummation of the Offer, from
taking any action contemplated by Section 8.01(d)(i), including having the
Board of Directors take such actions as are necessary to approve or resolve
to approve the intention to enter into an agreement with respect to
a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined) (or any announcement in
connection therewith) or enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal concurrently with termination pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(i).  
(b) "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal for a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation or
other business combination involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any tender offer
(including self-tenders) or exchange offer that if consummated would result
in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or a substantial
portion of the assets of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;   (c) "Superior Proposal"
means an Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors determines, in
good faith after consultation with an independent, nationally recognized
investment banking firm, (i) if consummated would result in a transaction
more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders, from a financial point of
view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is
reasonably capable of being financed by the person making such Acquisition
Proposal.   SECTION 6.06 Consents, Approvals and Filings. (a) Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto
shall (i) make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions, under the HSR Act, the CAC, the EC Merger Regulation,
the Exchange Act and any other relevant statute, rule or regulation, with
respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) use     33  41 reasonable best efforts (or, in
connection with obtaining antitrust approval from any U.S. Governmental
Entity, best efforts) to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including
using reasonable best efforts (or, in connection with obtaining antitrust
approval from any U.S. Governmental Entity, best efforts) to obtain all
licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications
and orders of Governmental Entities and cooperate to obtain all consents,
approvals and authorizations (without out-of-pocket expense to the Company)
of parties to contracts with the Company and its Subsidiaries as are
necessary for the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and to fulfill the conditions to the Offer
and the Merger. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall use
their reasonable best efforts to take all such action.   (b)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent agrees to, and to
cause its affiliates to, promptly take all steps necessary to secure
government antitrust clearance for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable but by no later than
June 30, 2001. Parent agrees to give the Company reasonable notice of any
meetings prior to the Closing Date with any Governmental Entity regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company at its option may have
representatives at such meetings.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Parent agrees to use its best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all necessary action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary to satisfy the condition to the Offer set forth in clause (c) of
Exhibit A; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries to take, or cause to be taken, or do or cause to be
done, any action which would result in a material detriment to Parent and its
Subsidiaries or would result in a material restriction on the business
activities thereof. Upon receiving written advice from the Works\' Council of
Parent that is not Positive Advice or Acceptable Conditional Advice, Parent
shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event within five days thereof,
notify the Works\' Council in writing, as required by the Netherlands Works
Council Act, as to its intention to enter into the Facility and issue the
Facility Guarantee (each as defined in Exhibit A hereto).   SECTION 6.07
Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Parent agrees that those individuals who are
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall continue to be employees of the Surviving Entity as of
the Effective Time (each such employee, an "Affected Employee"); provided,
however, that this Section 6.07 shall not be construed to limit the ability
of the applicable employer to terminate the employment of any Affected
Employee at any time.   (b) For a period of 12 months following the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide each Affected Employee with employee benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to each such Affected Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than equity-based compensation
or benefits provided under the Employee Stock Ownership Plan), provided that
Parent shall not be required to provide equity-based compensation to any
Affected Employees. Parent shall, for a    34  42 period of 12 months
following the Effective Time, maintain (or cause its Subsidiaries to
maintain) a severance pay practice, program or arrangement for the benefit of
each Affected Employee that is no less favorable than such practice, program
or arrangement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect
to such Affected Employee.   (c) To the extent permitted under applicable
law, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, give Affected
Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit
accrual (except for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan
or supplemental or excess pension plan) under such employee benefit plans or
arrangements maintained by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation in which
such Affected Employees participate for such Affected Employees\' service
with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to the same extent
recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time.   (d) To the extent permitted under applicable law,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected
Employees under any welfare benefit plans in which such Affected Employees
may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, other than
limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to
such Affected Employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective
Time under any welfare plan maintained for the Affected Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each Affected Employee with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time
in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under
any welfare plans that such Affected Employees are eligible to participate in
after the Effective Time.   (e) Parent shall, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to, discharge the obligations under any change in control
agreement entered into by the Company and an Affected Employee.   (f)
Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Under the ACNielsen Nonqualified Plans and
the Trust Under the ACNielsen Deferred Compensation Plan (together, the
"Rabbi Trusts"), the Company shall make an irrevocable contribution to each
Rabbi Trust in an amount (i) sufficient to pay each participant the benefits
under the plans covered by such Rabbi Trust and (ii) sufficient to pay the
annual fees payable to the trustees under such Rabbi Trust for a three-year
period.   SECTION 6.08 Indemnification; Directors\' and
Officers\' Insurance. (a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time,
the provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and advancement
of expenses set forth in Article V of the restated certificate of
incorporation of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement (a
true, correct and complete copy of which has been made available to Parent),
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time prior
to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company in respect of
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including,
without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless
such modification is required by law.    35  43  (b) From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
successors to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company (the "Covered Parties")
against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are
paid in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) incurred
in connection with any threatened or actual action, suit or proceeding based
in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that
such person is or was a director or officer of the Company
("Indemnified Liabilities"), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, to the full extent that a
corporation is permitted under the DGCL to indemnify its own directors or
officers, as the case may be. In the event any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation is brought against any Covered Party, the
indemnifying party shall assume and direct all aspects of the defense
thereof, including settlement, and the Covered Party shall cooperate in the
vigorous defense of any such matter. The Covered Party shall have a right to
participate in (but not control) the defense of any such matter with its own
counsel and at its own expense. Notwithstanding the right of the indemnifying
party to assume and control the defense of such litigation, claim or
proceeding, such Covered Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel and to participate in the defense of such litigation, claim or
proceeding, and the indemnifying party shall bear the fees, costs
and expenses of such separate counsel and shall pay such fees, costs and
expenses promptly after receipt of an invoice from such Covered Party if (i)
the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent such Covered
Party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the
defendants in, or targets of, any such litigation, claim or proceeding shall
have been advised by counsel that there may be legal defenses available to it
or to other Covered Parties which are different from or in addition to those
available to the indemnifying party, or (iii) the indemnifying party shall
not have employed counsel satisfactory to such Covered Party, in the exercise
of the Covered Party\'s reasonable judgment, to represent such Covered Party
within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such litigation,
claim or proceeding. The indemnifying party shall not settle any such matter
unless (i) the Covered Party gives prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, or (ii) the terms of the settlement provide
that the Covered Party shall have no responsibility for the discharge of any
settlement amount and impose no other obligations or duties on the Covered
Party, and the settlement discharges all rights against Covered Party with
respect to such matter. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable
for any settlement effected without its prior written consent. Any Covered
Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.08(b), upon
learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall
promptly notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to
notify shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it
may have under this Section 6.08(b), except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices such indemnifying party), and shall deliver to Parent
and the Surviving Corporation the undertaking contemplated by Section 145(e)
of the DGCL. The Covered Parties as a group will be represented by a single
law firm (plus no more than one local counsel in any jurisdiction) with
respect to each such matter unless there is, under applicable standards of
professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the
positions of any two or more Covered Parties. The rights to
indemnification under this Section 6.08(b) shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of six years from the    36  44 Effective Time;
provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
Indemnified Liabilities asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the disposition of such Indemnified Liabilities.   (c) For a period of
six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in
effect policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance, for the
benefit of those persons who are covered by the Company\'s directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policies at the Effective Time, providing
coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time that
is at least equal to the coverage provided under the Company\'s current
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies, to the extent that
such liability insurance can be maintained at an annual cost to Parent not
greater than 200 percent of the premium for the current Company directors\'
and officers\' liability insurance; provided that if such insurance cannot be
so maintained at such cost, Parent shall maintain as much of such insurance
as can be so maintained at a cost equal to 200 percent of the current annual
premiums of the Company for such insurance.   (d) In the event that Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors or assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall succeed to the obligations set forth in Section 6.07 and this Section
6.08.   SECTION 6.09 Undertakings. Each of Parent, Purchaser and
the Company agree to make the undertakings and to take or cause to be taken
all other actions as are required in order to comply with the Indemnity and
Joint Defense Agreement dated as of October 28, 1996 among The Dun and
Bradstreet Corporation, NMR (as successor to Cognizant Corporation) and the
Company.   ARTICLE VII  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT   SECTION 7.01 Conditions to
Each Party\'s Obligation to Effect the Merger. The respective obligation of
each party to effect the Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction or
written waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the following
conditions:   (a) Completion of the Offer. Purchaser shall have accepted
for  payment and paid for all Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not 
withdrawn; provided, however, that neither Parent nor Purchaser may  invoke
this condition if Purchaser shall have failed to purchase Shares  so tendered
and not withdrawn in violation of the terms of this  Agreement or the
Offer.   (b) Stockholder Approval. This Agreement shall have been  adopted
by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the  outstanding
shares of Common Stock of the Company if such vote is  required pursuant to
the Company\'s restated certificate of  incorporation, the DGCL or other

restraining  order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued
by any  court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or
prohibition  preventing the consummation of the Merger shall be in effect;
provided,  however, that, prior to invoking this condition, the party so
invoking  this condition shall have complied with its obligations under
Section  6.03 and Section 6.06 and the parties hereto shall have used their 
reasonable best efforts or best efforts (as applicable) to lift or  remove
such order, injunction, restraint or prohibition.   ARTICLE VIII  
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   SECTION 8.01 Termination. This Agreement
may be terminated and the Merger contemplated herein may be abandoned at any
time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of matters
presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of Purchaser or,
subject to the terms hereof, of the Company:   (a) By the mutual written
consent of Parent and the Company  duly authorized by the Board of Directors
of Parent and the Company;  provided, however, that if Parent shall have
nominated a majority of  the directors pursuant to Section 1.04, such consent
of the Company may  only be given if approved by the Board of Directors of
the Company in  accordance with Section 1.04(c).   (b) By either of Parent
or the Company duly authorized by the  Board of Directors of such person if
(i) a statute, rule or executive  order shall have been enacted, entered or
promulgated prohibiting the  transactions contemplated hereby on the terms
contemplated by this  Agreement or (ii) any Governmental Entity shall have
issued an order,  decree or ruling or taken any other action (which order,
decree, ruling  or other action the parties hereto shall use their reasonable
best  efforts (or, in connection with obtaining antitrust approval from any 
Governmental Entity, best efforts) to lift), in each case permanently 
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions 
contemplated hereby and such order, decree, ruling or other action  shall
have become final and non-appealable.   (c) By either of Parent or the
Company duly authorized by the  Board of Directors of such person if
consummation of the Offer shall  not have occurred on or before June 30, 2001
(the "Termination Date");  provided, however, that the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement  pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) shall not have
breached in any  material respect its obligations under this Agreement; and
provided  further that the Termination Date shall be extended to such later
date  (but in no event later than September 30, 2001) as the Offer shall
have  been extended by Purchaser at the request of the Company pursuant to 
the third sentence of Section 1.01(c) hereof, unless a condition to 
consummation of the Offer (other than the condition referred to in  clause
(c) of Exhibit A) shall not have been satisfied and either (i)  Parent can
reasonably demonstrate that such failure to be satisfied  resulted from a
reason other than the failure of the condition set  forth in clause (c) of
Exhibit A to be satisfied or (ii) such condition  failed to be satisfied as a
result of a material breach by the Company  of its obligations
hereunder.     38  46  (d) By the Company, upon approval of its Board of
Directors:   (i) prior to consummation of the Offer, if (A) the  Board of
Directors of the Company notifies Parent in writing  that it intends to enter
into an agreement with respect to a  Superior Proposal, attaching the most
current version of such  agreement (or a description of all material terms
and  conditions thereof) to such notice, (B) Parent does not make,  within
four Business Days of receipt of the Company\'s written  notification of its
intention to enter into a binding  agreement for a Superior Proposal, an
offer that the Board of  Directors of the Company determines, in good faith
after  consultation with its financial advisor, is at least as  favorable to
the stockholders of the Company as such Superior  Proposal, it being
understood that the Company shall not enter  into any such binding agreement
during such four-day period  and (C) the Company prior to such termination
pursuant to this  Section 8.01(d)(i) pays to Parent in immediately
available  funds the Termination Fee (as such term is defined in Section 
8.03(b)). The Company agrees to notify Parent promptly if its  intention to
enter into a written agreement referred to in its  notification shall change
at any time after giving effect to  such notification; or   (ii) if Parent
or Purchaser shall have terminated the  Offer or the Offer expires without
Parent or Purchaser, as the  case may be, purchasing any Shares pursuant
thereto; provided  that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to  this Section 8.01(d)(ii) if the Company is in material breach  of this
Agreement; or   (iii) prior to the consummation of the Offer, if (A)  there
shall be a breach of any representation or warranty of  Parent or Purchaser
in this Agreement that is qualified as to  Material Adverse Effect, (B) there
shall be a breach in any  material respect of any representation or warranty
of Parent  or Purchaser in this Agreement that is not so qualified, other 
than any such breaches which, in the aggregate, have not had  or would not
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse  Effect on Parent and
Purchaser, taken as a whole, or (C) there  shall be a material breach by
Parent or Purchaser of any of  its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which  breach, in the case of clause (A), (B) or (C), either is
not  reasonably capable of being cured or, if it is reasonably  capable of
being cured, has not been cured within the earlier  of (i) 10 days after
giving of notice to Parent of such breach  and (ii) the expiration of the
Offer, provided that the  Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this  Section 8.01(d)(iii) if the Company is in material breach of  this
Agreement.   (e) By Parent or Purchaser duly authorized by the Board of 
Directors of such person:   (i) prior to the consummation of the Offer, if
the  Board of Directors of the Company shall have withdrawn, or  modified or
changed, in a manner adverse to Parent or  Purchaser, its approval or
recommendation of the Offer, this  Agreement or the Merger or shall have
recommended or approved  an Acquisition    39  47  Proposal, it being
understood and agreed that neither the  delivery of notice pursuant to
Section 8.01(d)(i) and any  subsequent public announcement of such notice nor
any  communication by the Board of Directors of the Company to the 
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(e)(3) under  the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to the  stockholders of the Company in
connection with the making or  amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer)
shall entitle  Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 
8.01(e)(i), unless the Company enters into a definitive  agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal; or   (ii) prior to the consummation of
the Offer, if there  shall have been a material breach by the Company of
any  provision of Section 6.05; or   (iii) if the Offer has expired or
terminated without  Parent or Purchaser purchasing any Shares thereunder
and,  pursuant to Exhibit A and Article I hereof, Purchaser is  neither
required to accept and pay for the Shares tendered in  the Offer nor to
extend the expiration date of the Offer;  provided that Parent or Purchaser
may not terminate this  Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(e)(iii) if
Parent or  Purchaser is in material breach of this Agreement; or   (iv)
prior to the consummation of the Offer, if the  Company shall have (A)
exempted for purposes of Section 203 of  the DGCL any acquisition of Shares
by any person or "group"  (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act), other  than Parent, Purchaser or their affiliates, or (B) amended (or 
agreed to amend) its Rights Agreement or redeemed (or agreed  to redeem) its
outstanding Rights thereunder for the purpose  of exempting an acquisition of
Shares from such Rights  Agreement and Rights; or   (v) prior to the
consummation of the Offer, if (A)  there shall be a breach of any
representation or warranty of  the Company in this Agreement that is
qualified as to Material  Adverse Effect, (B) there shall be a breach in any
material  respect of any representation or warranty of the Company in  this
Agreement that is not so qualified other than any such  breaches which, in
the aggregate, have not had or would not  reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the  Company, or (C) there shall be a material
breach by the  Company of any of its covenants or agreements contained in 
this Agreement, which breach, in the case of clause (A), (B)  or (C), either
is not reasonably capable of being cured or, if  it is reasonably capable of
being cured, has not been cured  within the earlier of (i) 10 days after
giving of written  notice to the Company of such breach and (ii) the
expiration  of the Offer; provided that Parent or Purchaser may not 
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(e)(v)  if Parent or
Purchaser is in material breach of this  Agreement.   SECTION 8.02 Effect
of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the
Company or Parent or Purchaser as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or
obligation on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the Company, other than the
provisions of Section 6.02(a), this     40  48 Section 8.02, Section
8.03 and Article IX and except to the extent that such termination results
from the material breach by a party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.   SECTION
8.03 Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as provided in Section 8.03(b) and Section
8.03(c) below, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Offer,
the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Offer
or the Merger is consummated.   (b) If (i) Parent or Purchaser terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e)(i) or 8.01(e)(iv), or (ii) the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(i), then, in
each case, the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent, at or prior
to the time of termination in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
8.01(d)(i) or as promptly as is reasonably practicable (but in no event later
than two Business Days), in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
8.01(e)(i) or (iv), an amount (the "Termination Fee") equal to $60,000,000.
In addition, if (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.01(e)(ii), 8.01(e)(iii) or 8.01(d)(ii), (B) on the date of such
termination, no condition to the Offer has failed to be satisfied as a result
of a material breach of this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser and prior
thereto there shall have been publicly announced, and not withdrawn, an
Acquisition Proposal, and (C) within 15 months after such termination, the
Company shall enter into an agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, then the Company shall pay the Termination Fee concurrently with
entering into any such agreement.   (c) If the condition set forth in clause
(c) of Exhibit A is not satisfied and this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 8.01(c), unless a condition to consummation of the Offer (other
than the condition referred to clause (c) of Exhibit A) shall not have been
satisfied and either (i) Parent can reasonably demonstrate that such failure
to be satisfied resulted from a reason other than the failure of the
condition set forth in such clause (c) to be satisfied or (ii) such condition
failed to be satisfied as a result of a material breach by the Company of its
obligations hereunder, then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Company an amount equal to $60,000,000, which shall be paid (A) at or prior
to such termination by Parent and as a condition to such termination or (B)
not later than two Business Days following such termination by the

of the terms contained herein; provided, however, that after the adoption of

any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.   ARTICLE IX   GENERAL PROVISIONS   SECTION 9.01
