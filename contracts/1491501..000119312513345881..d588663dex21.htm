conditions), unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company; _provided, however_ , that if the Marketing Period has
not been completed at the time of the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted
by Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those

Company and (b) the second Business Day after the end of the Marketing Period
(subject in each case to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waiver of all the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ for the Closing as of
the date determined pursuant to this proviso). The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

 

Section 2.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
promptly as reasonably practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall
file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), in such form
as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings and
recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on such
date and time as the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later date and time as Parent
and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The
date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Effective Time_ ".

 

Section 2.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time,
except as otherwise provided herein, the Surviving Corporation shall possess

duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_.

applicable Law.

 



11 Section 2.06 _Directors_. The Company and the Surviving Corporation shall take
all necessary action (including procuring the resignation of members of the

may be.

Section 2.07 _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Sub in accordance with the terms hereof, the
Surviving Corporation, the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation and

action, consistent with this Agreement, on behalf of the Company, Sub and the
Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE III.

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE

CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

Section 3.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or
any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital
stock of Parent or Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that immediately prior to the Effective Time is owned by
the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (including as treasury stock), or
by Parent or Sub (or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Sub) at such
time, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
each share of Restricted Stock, but excluding shares to be canceled in
accordance with _Section 3.01(b)_ and except as provided in _Section
3.01(d)_ with respect to the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive $17.50 in cash, without interest and subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in

 



12  book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration.

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
" _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section 3.01(c)_, but instead such
holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective
Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_,
without any interest thereon but subject to any withholding of Taxes required
by applicable Law. The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of
any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock or written
threats thereof, withdrawals of such demands and any other documents
(including instruments served pursuant to the DGCL) received by the Company,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands or other documents. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing, except to
the extent required by applicable Law.

Section 3.02 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Without limiting the
other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there shall be any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock, the Merger
Consideration as provided in  _Section 3.01(c)_ shall be equitably adjusted
to reflect the economic effect thereof.

Section 3.03 _Exchange Fund_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the delivery of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Article III_ and, in connection therewith, shall enter
into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to
the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause
to

 



13  be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to this
Agreement (such deposited cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

(b) _Certificate Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each Person who was, as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, a holder of record of a Certificate (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, holders of Restricted Stock) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form (including
customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with
respect to shares held in book-entry form)), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to
the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company
Common Stock (including Restricted Stock) previously represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 3.01(c)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock (including Restricted Stock) which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, but only if such Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise is
in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that payment
of the Merger Consideration with respect to shares held in book-entry form
shall only be made to the Person in whose name such book-entry shares are
registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.03(b)_, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which
the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate
pursuant to this _Article III_ , except for Certificates in respect
of Appraisal Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the right to receive
the consideration due with respect to such Appraisal Shares in accordance with
_Section 3.01(d)_ and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.
No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates or book-entry shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
III_.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates (or automatically, in the case of book-entry
shares) in accordance with the terms of this  _Article III_ shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates (or such
book-entry shares). At the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificate or book-entry share (other than a
Certificate or

 



14  book-entry share in respect of Appraisal Shares) is presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against payment of
Merger Consideration to the holder thereof as provided in this _Article III_.

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall each remain
liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article III_ , in each case without interest thereon
and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance
with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the
date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated P-1 or A-1 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available) and a long term debt rating of Aa3 or A+ or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid solely to Parent. Nothing contained herein and no investment
losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish
the rights of any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger Consideration
or any holder of a Company Stock Option to receive the holders Equity Award
Amount, in each case as provided herein.

 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and

 



15  withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold under
applicable Law. Any amounts so withheld shall be promptly paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent and such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 3.04 _Company Stock Options_. As promptly as practicable following the
date of this Agreement and, in any event, prior to Closing, the Board of
Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company
Incentive Plan) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as
may be required to provide that each unexercised Company Stock
Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time is vested and canceled, with the holder thereof becoming

legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (where such
concept is recognized under applicable Law) under the Laws of its respective
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization except where the failure to be
so organized, validly existing and in good standing would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially and adversely impair
the ability of such Subsidiary to conduct its business as currently conducted.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate,
partnership, limited liability company or other entity power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as
presently conducted by it, except where the failure to have such power or

jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties requires such qualification or licensing, except
where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the Organizational

contain, as the case may be, any untrue statement of a material fact or

properties, assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses in any material

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered by Parent and Sub
to the Company concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "), Parent and Sub jointly and severally
represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

Section 5.01 _Organization; Qualification_.

 

(a) Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Sub is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. Each of Parent and its Sub has all requisite power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as presently conducted, except where the failure to have such
power and authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger and the
other Transactions, or Parents and Subs ability to observe and perform
their material obligations hereunder (" _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ ").

(b) Each of Parent and its Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable
Law) as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction where the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its respective assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Sub has made available to
the Company complete and correct copies of its respective 

 



39  Organizational Documents, each as amended to date, and each such
Organizational Document as made available to the Company is in full force and
effect. Neither Parent nor Sub is in violation of its Organizational
Documents.

Section 5.02 _Operation and Ownership of Parent and Sub_. Parent and Sub have
been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and, prior
to the Effective Time, will not have engaged in any business activities, other
than activities pursuant to this Agreement, the performance of its respective
obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto. Parent owns,
beneficially and of record, all the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Sub, free and clear of all Liens. There are no options, warrants or other
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments to which Sub is a party
relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other equity interests in
Sub to grant, issue or sell any shares of the capital stock, or other equity
interests in Sub, by sale or otherwise. There are no obligations, contingent
or otherwise, of Sub to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
the capital stock of Sub.

 

Section 5.03 _Authority; No Violation_.

(a) Each of Parent and Sub has all requisite power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to adoption of this Agreement by Parent as sole
stockholder of Sub (which adoption will occur immediately following execution
of this Agreement) and the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to the
DGCL, to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Sub, the consummation of the
Merger and the other Transactions and compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement, by each of Parent and Sub have been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action on the part of each of Parent and Sub, and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent and Sub (including any
stockholder action) on the part of Parent or Sub are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger
subject, in the case of filing the Certificate of Merger and consummating the
Merger, to adoption of this Agreement by Parent as sole stockholder of Sub
(which adoption will occur immediately following execution of this Agreement).
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Sub
and, assuming this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by the Company, this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Sub in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and to equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Sub of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions
by Parent and Sub and compliance with the provisions hereof by Parent and Sub
do not require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by,
filing with or notification to any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent
or Sub or any of their respective assets or businesses, other than (i) the
filing of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL; (ii) compliance
with the applicable requirements of the HSR Act and the filings and receipt,
termination or expiration as applicable, of such other approvals or waiting
periods as may be required under any other applicable Antitrust Laws; (iii)
compliance with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act; (iv) as
disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule; and
(v)

 



40  any such consent, approval, authorization, permit, action, filing or
notification the failure of which to make or obtain would not, individually or
in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Sub of this
Agreement does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions and compliance with the provisions hereof by Parent and Sub will
not, (i) result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, require consent under, or give rise to a right
of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss
of any benefit under any (A) Contract to which Parent or Sub is a party, or
(B) permit, concession, franchise, right or license binding upon Parent or
Sub, (ii) result in the creation of any Liens upon any of the properties or
assets of Parent or Sub, (iii) conflict with or result in any violation of any
provision of the Organizational Documents of Parent or Sub or (iv) assuming
that the consents and approvals referred to in _Section 5.03(b)_ are obtained
and Parent consents to the adoption of this Agreement as sole stockholder of
Sub (which adoption will occur immediately following execution of this
Agreement), conflict with or violate any applicable Laws, other than, in the
case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iv), as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or be reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 5.04 _Financing._

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies,
including all exhibits, schedules or amendments thereto, of the fully
executed (i) commitment letters, each dated as of the date of this Agreement,
between Parent and F.L.P. Trust #14, P.G. Gigi Trust M, F.L.P. Trust #11, P.G.
Tom Trust M and P.G. Tom Trust (each, a " _Sponsor_ " and collectively, the "
_Sponsors_ "), respectively, and attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (together, the
" _Equity Commitment Letters_ "), pursuant to which each of the Sponsors has
committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to
invest in Parent the cash amounts set forth in its Equity Commitment Letter
(together, the " _Equity Financing_ "), and (ii) commitment letter, dated as
of the date of this Agreement, among Parent, Sub and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA and attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ " and together with the Equity Commitment Letters,
the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which the Lender Parties have
committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to
lend the amounts set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "
_Debt Financing_ " and together with the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_
"). In no event will the receipt of the Financing by Parent or Sub (or any
other financing transaction) be a condition to any of Parent or Subs
obligations hereunder.

(b) None of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified prior to
the date of this Agreement, and, as of the date of this Agreement, the
respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been
modified, withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. As of the date
hereof, except for (i) the Debt Fee Letter, (ii) the Financing Commitments
and (iii) customary engagement letters with respect to debt securities that
may form part of the Debt Financing (none of which would adversely affect the
amount or availability of the Debt Financing), there are no other agreements,
side letters or arrangements to which Parent or Sub is a party relating to the
funding or investing of the Financing. As of the date hereof, the Financing
Commitments are in full force and effect and constitute the legally

 



41  valid and binding obligations of Parent and Sub, as applicable, the other
parties to the Equity Commitment Letters and, to the knowledge of Parent, the
other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter. There are no conditions
precedent between Parent or Sub, on the one hand, and any other party to the
Financing Commitments or the executed fee letter, dated as of the date hereof,
among Parent, Sub and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA (a
true, complete and correct copy of which has been furnished to the Company
with the pricing terms, fee amounts and certain economic terms redacted) (the
" _Debt Fee Letter_ "), on the other hand, related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing (including any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt
Fee Letter), other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments.
Assuming (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this
Agreement are true and correct (without regard, in the case of the
representations contained in _Section 4.07_, to any qualification by or
reference to "Company Material Adverse Effect"), (ii) the Company
has performed and complied with its covenants under this Agreement, (iii) the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied and (iv) the
Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments, the proceeds
to be disbursed pursuant to the agreements contemplated by the Financing
Commitments, in the aggregate and together with the available cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities of the Company, will be sufficient for
Parent to pay the Merger Consideration and all related fees and expenses at
the Closing and to provide for any required repayment or refinancing of
Indebtedness of the Company. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred
which would result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or
an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) by
Parent or Sub under the Financing Commitments, and Parent does not have any
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing Commitments
will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent or
Sub, as applicable, on the Closing Date. Parent has fully paid all commitment
fees and other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof
pursuant to the Financing Commitments and will pay in full all amounts due on
or before the Closing Date.

Section 5.05 _Limited Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, each of the Sponsors has duly executed and delivered to the Company
the limited guaranty by such Sponsor, dated as of the date of this Agreement,
in favor of the Company (each, a " _Limited Guaranty_ " and collectively, the
" _Limited Guaranties_ ") and attached hereto as _Exhibit C_. Each Limited
Guaranty is in full force an effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Sponsor party thereto, enforceable against such Sponsor in
accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy,
insolvency and other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equity principles. As of the date of this
Agreement, there is no default under any Limited Guaranty by the Sponsor party
thereto, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving
of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder by such Sponsor.

Section 5.06 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
Litigation pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent,
Sub, either Sponsor or any of their respective Affiliates that, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Order
outstanding against Parent, Sub, either Sponsor or any of their respective
Affiliates that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

 



42 Section 5.07 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Sub or any of their Subsidiaries for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Information Statement or Proxy
Statement, as applicable, will, at the date it is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. 

Section 5.08 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders or
financial advisors fee or commission in connection with the Merger or the
other Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or
Sub or their Affiliates (including each Sponsor and its Affiliates).

Section 5.09 _No Competing Businesses_. None of Parents Affiliates, any
other Entity within the same Person as Parent or any Associate of such Person
derive any revenue in, and none of Parent, any of its Affiliates, any other
Entity within the same Person as Parent or any Associate of such Person
(together, " _Parent s Competition Law Group_") is, or beneficially owns
equity interests or voting securities (including any equity interests or
voting securities that may be acquired through the conversion or exchange of
securities or the exercise of options, warrants or other rights) in excess of
4.9% of the outstanding capital stock of, an Entity that derived revenue in
any NAICS code or NACE code set forth in Section 5.09 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule since the beginning of its most recent completed fiscal
year, or is as of the date of this Agreement party to, or in negotiations to
become party to, a Contract to acquire such beneficial ownership. No member of
Parents Competition Law Group is engaged in or has an ownership interest
(other than an ownership of up to 4.9% of the outstanding publicly-traded
equity securities) in any Person or Entity engaged in (a) the steel production
industry or (b) any line of business described with respect to the Company in
the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012,
filed with the SEC on February 19, 2013. As used in this _Section 5.09_, (i)
the terms "Entity", "Person", "Acquiring Person" and "Associate" have the
respective meanings given to such terms in the rules promulgated under the HSR
Act, and (ii) "NAICS" refers to North American Industry Classification System
and "NACE" refers to Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the
European Community (in French: _Nomenclature statistique des activit es
economiques dans la Communaute europeenne_). 

Section 5.10 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. None of Parent, Sub, each
Sponsor or any of their Affiliates beneficially own (within the meaning of
Section 13 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder) five percent or more of the Companys Class A Common Stock as of
the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.11 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the Company is Solvent as of the date
hereof and as of immediately prior to the Closing (and for the avoidance of
doubt, in each case before giving effect to any Indebtedness incurred or to be
incurred to consummate the Transactions), (b) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company (without regard to, in the case
of the representations contained in _Section 4.07_, any qualification by or
reference to "Company Material Adverse Effect") set forth in _Article IV_ ,
(c) the performance in all material respects by the Company of its covenants
under this Agreement, (d) the conditions

 



43  set forth in _Section 7.02_ have been satisfied, and (e) the estimates,
projections and forecasts of the Company that have been provided to Parent and
its Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement have been prepared in
good faith upon assumptions that were reasonable when prepared, each of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and
immediately after the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions
(after giving effect to any financing and the payment of the Merger
Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of any Indebtedness of the
Company, the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions and the payment of all
related fees and expenses). For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Solvent_ " means that, as of any date of determination and with respect to
any Person: (i) the sum of the Indebtedness (including contingent
liabilities) of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, does not
exceed the present fair saleable value of the present assets of such Person
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii) the capital of such Person and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is not unreasonably small in relation to
the business of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and (iii)
such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, do not have or intend to
incur Indebtedness including current obligations beyond their ability to pay
such Indebtedness as they mature in the ordinary course of business;
_provided_ , _however_ , that for the purposes hereof, the amount of any
contingent liability at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in
light of all of the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents
the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured
liability (irrespective of whether such contingent liabilities meet the
criteria for accrual under GAAP).

Section 5.12 _Certain Arrangements_. Except as set forth in Section 5.12 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no Contracts between Parent or Sub
(or any of their respective Affiliates) and any of the Companys officers or
other Management Level Employees or directors as of the date hereof that
relate in any way to their employment, the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries
or the Transactions.

well as in such business plans, with which each of Parent and Sub is familiar,
that each of Parent and Sub is making its own evaluation of the adequacy and

forward-looking statements or business plans (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking statements or business plans), except for, in the case of the Company,
the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article IV_ , as

sources and the use of expert networks and (B) to the extent the Board of

of Company Common Stock under applicable Law), or (vi) publicly propose to do
any of the foregoing.

 



49 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.03(a)_
or  _6.03(b)_ at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
the later of (x) 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the date that is thirty-
five days after the date hereof (the " _Consent End Date_ ") (in the event
that the Stockholder Written Consent is delivered to the Company in accordance
with _Section 6.04(a)_ hereof) or (y) the date and time on which Stockholder
Approval is obtained (the " _Stockholder Approval Date_ ") (in the event that
the Stockholder Written Consent is not delivered to the Company in accordance
with _Section 6.04(a)_ hereof and this Agreement is not terminated in
accordance with _Section 8.01(g)_), if the Company receives a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal from any Person that was not received or obtained
in material violation of this _Section 6.03_, (i) the Company and its
Representatives may provide information (including non-public information and
data) regarding, and afford access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records and personnel of, the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person if
the Company receives from such Person (or has received from such Person) an
executed confidentiality and standstill agreement that is no less restrictive
of such Person in the aggregate than the Confidentiality Agreement (an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ that the Company shall
promptly make available to Parent any material nonpublic information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person
making such Acquisition Proposal that is given such access and that was not
previously made available to Parent or its Representatives, and (ii) the
Company and its Representatives may engage in, enter into, or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person with respect
to such Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that prior to taking
any action described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Board of Directors
determines in good faith (A) after consultation with its outside financial and
legal advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and
(B) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the holders of Company
Common Stock under applicable Law.

(d) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within twenty-four hours) notify Parent if it takes any action
described in clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section 6.03(c)_, which notice shall
include the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and a copy
of the Acquisition Proposal to which such action relates (if made in writing)
or the material terms and conditions thereof (if not made in writing).
Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed (orally or in writing) on a prompt basis (and in any
event within twenty-four hours) of any material developments, material
discussions or material negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal
described in the immediately preceding sentence and, upon the reasonable
request of Parent, shall apprise Parent of the status of any discussions or
negotiations with respect thereto. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into
any agreement that would prohibit them from providing such information to
Parent.

(e) Neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (x)
withdraw or modify or amend or qualify (in a manner adverse to Parent), or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify or amend or qualify (in a manner
adverse to Parent), the Recommendation, (y) if a tender offer or exchange
offer for shares of capital stock of the Company that constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend against acceptance of
such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of the Company 

 



50  (including, for these purposes, by taking no position with respect to the
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the holders of Company
Common Stock, which shall constitute a failure to recommend against
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer) within ten (10) Business
Days after commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act;
or (z) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal (any of the actions specified in the foregoing clauses
(x), (y) or (z), a " _Change of Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding anything
in _Section 6.03_ to the contrary, the Board of Directors may, at any time
prior to (x) the Consent End Date (in the event that the Stockholder Written
Consent is delivered to the Company in accordance with _Section 6.04(a)_
hereof) or (y) the Stockholder Approval Date (in the event that the
Stockholder Written Consent is not delivered to the Company in accordance with
_Section 6.04(a)_ hereof and this Agreement is not terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.01(g)_), but subject to compliance with clauses (i) and (ii)
below, (A) effect a Change of Recommendation if, as a result of an event,
development or change in circumstances that first occurs, arises or becomes
known after the date of this Agreement (other than the receipt, existence or
terms of any Acquisition Proposal, which is subject to clause (B) below, or
any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof), the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the holders of Company Common Stock
under applicable Law or (B) effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate
this Agreement to enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement,
in each case, with respect to a Superior Proposal, if (1) the Company receives
a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors
concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all
of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by
Parent pursuant to clause (ii) below, and (2) the Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the holders of Company Common Stock under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case of the foregoing clauses (A) and
(B) the Board of Directors may not effect or make a Change of Recommendation
or, as applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
6.03(e)_ and _Section 8.01(h)_ unless, in the case of clause (B) above, such
Superior Proposal did not result from a breach by the Company of this _Section
6.03_, and, in the case of clauses (A) and (B) above:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Sub of
its intention to effect or make a Change of Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement as contemplated by this _Section 6.03(e)_ at least four calendar
days in advance of taking such action (the " _Notice Period_ "), which notice
shall include, in the case of clause (B) above, an unredacted copy of such
Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the then-
current form of all relevant transaction agreements relating to such Superior
Proposal (and any debt and equity financing materials related thereto that
were provided to the Company); and

 

(ii) prior to effecting or making a Change of Recommendation or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a proposed definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, (x) the Company shall have negotiated, and

 



51  shall have directed its Representatives to negotiate, during the Notice
Period, with Parent and Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Sub desire
to negotiate) to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (y) the Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) any
adjustments to this Agreement submitted in writing by Parent and Sub during
the Notice Period, and (z) the Board of Directors shall have determined in
good faith that, after giving effect to such adjustments, the Superior
Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal (in the case of clause (B)
above) or it would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the holders of
Company Common Stock under applicable Law to not effect a Change in
Recommendation.

In the event of any material revision to the terms of any such Superior
Proposal, including any change in any price term thereof, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and Sub and to again
comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.03(e)_ with respect to such
new written notice, except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to two
calendar days for any such new notice. If the Company shall have given the
notice contemplated by subparagraph (i) above with respect to a Superior
Proposal prior to the Consent End Date, the Consent End Date shall be extended
with respect to such Superior Proposal until the twenty-four (24)
hours following the conclusion of the procedures described in subparagraph
(ii) above and the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(f) Subject to the proviso in this _Section 6.03(f)_, nothing contained in
this _Section 6.03_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company, the Board of
Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to stockholders in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), or (ii) making any "stop-
look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
stockholders of the Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure
permitted under clause (i) of this _Section 6.03(f)_ shall be deemed a Change
of Recommendation unless it includes either an express rejection of any
applicable Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of
the Recommendation.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, offer or proposal from any
Person (a) that is structured to permit such Person to acquire, directly or
indirectly and in a single transaction or a series of related transactions,
(1) 15% or more (based on the fair market value, as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors) of the assets (including capital stock of the
Subsidiaries of the Company) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, or (2)(A) shares of Company Common Stock which, together
with any other shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by such
Person, would be equal to 15% or more of the issued and outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or (B) any other class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, 

 



52  (b) concerning any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in any Person owning, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or any other equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) concerning any
merger, consolidation, business combination, binding share exchange or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
which any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) would own, directly or
indirectly, 15% or more of the aggregate voting power of the Company or of the
surviving entity in a merger or the resulting direct or indirect parent of
the Company or such surviving entity, or (d) concerning any recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or any other similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its material operating Subsidiaries, other than, in each
case, the Transactions.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
not obtained in violation of this _Section 6.03_ and not made by a Person
that was solicited in violation of this _Section 6.03_ that the Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) (x) is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms, and (y) would be more favorable to the stockholders
of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger and the
other Transactions (after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the
terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent pursuant to _Section
6.03(e)(ii)_), in each case taking into account all financial, legal,
financing, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal
(including the financing terms thereof, the expected timing and risk and
likelihood of consummation, and the Person making the Acquisition Proposal)
and of this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement
as contemplated by _Section 6.03(e)_); _provided_ , that for purposes of the
definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "15%" in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "85%".

(h) The Company agrees that in the event any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
or its Subsidiaries Representatives takes any action which if taken by the
Company, would constitute a violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 6.03_, then the Company shall be deemed to be in violation of this 
_Section 6.03_.

Section 6.04 _Stockholder Approval; Information Statement or Proxy
Statement_. 

(a) _Stockholder Approval_. Immediately after the execution of this Agreement
by each of the parties hereto and in lieu of calling a meeting of the
Companys stockholders, the Company shall submit the form of irrevocable

51% of the outstanding voting power of Company Common Stock (such written
consent, as duly executed and delivered by the record holders of at least 51%
of the outstanding voting power of Company Common Stock, the " _Stockholder
Written Consent_ "). As soon as practicable upon receipt of the Stockholder
Written Consent, which shall constitute the requisite Stockholder Approval for
all purposes under this Agreement, the Organizational Documents of the Company
and applicable Law, the Company will provide Parent with a facsimile copy of
such Stockholder Written Consent, certified as true and complete by an

 



53  executive officer of the Company. In connection with the Stockholder

comply in all respects, with the DGCL, including Section 228 and Section 262

thereof or supplements thereto, the " _Information Statement_ "). The
Information Statement shall include the Recommendation with respect to the
Merger, the Fairness Opinion and a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL, and will
otherwise contain all information required by Delaware Law (including Section
262 of the DGCL). The Company will cause the Information Statement, at the
date the Information Statement is filed with the SEC and at the time of the
mailing of the Information Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto,
to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no agreement, representation or
warranty is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by Parent
or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Information
Statement. The Company shall cause the Information Statement to comply as to
form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and to satisfy all rules of the
NYSE. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Sub upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Information
Statement, and shall provide Parent and Sub with copies of all correspondence
between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or
the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of
the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Information Statement,
and the Company shall provide Parent and Sub and their respective counsel a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any written
response to any such written comments of the SEC or its staff. Prior to the
filing of the Information Statement or the dissemination thereof to the
holders of Company Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC or
the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent
and Sub a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such
document or response (and shall give good faith consideration to the comments
of Parent and Sub and their counsel).

 



54 (ii) If the Stockholder Written Consent is not executed by the Companys
stockholders holding, in the aggregate, Company Common Stock representing at
least 51% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock and such Stockholder Written Consent shall not have been duly delivered
to Parent and the Company prior to 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on the date
immediately following the date of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
6.04(a)_ (a " _Written Consent Failure_ "), Parent shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement as set forth in _Section 8.01(g)_. In the event
that Parent does not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_
within the time period provided therein, the Company shall
discontinue activities with respect to the Information Statement contemplated
by subparagraph (i) and shall, as promptly as practicable after the expiration
of such period and with the assistance and approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) of Parent, prepare and file with the SEC a
proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") related to this Agreement and the Transactions, to be sent to
the stockholders of the Company relating to the meeting of the Companys
stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") to be held for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, shall take all lawful
action to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting on a date as soon as reasonably practicable following the mailing of
the definitive Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval and shall take all lawful action to solicit the adoption
of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders in accordance with the DGCL
(it being acknowledged that the disclosure of any Change of Recommendation
effected by the Board of Directors pursuant to  _Section 6.03(e)_ shall not
constitute a failure to comply with this sentence). Unless the Board of
Directors of the Company has effected a Change of Recommendation effected by
the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to  _Section 6.03(e)_, the
Recommendation of the Board of Directors shall be included in the Proxy
Statement.

(c)  _Covenants of Parent with Respect to the Information or Proxy
Statement_. Parent shall provide to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Sub as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection
with the Information Statement or Proxy Statement and shall otherwise assist
and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Information Statement
or Proxy Statement and resolution of comments of the SEC or its staff related
thereto. Parent will cause the information relating to Parent or Sub supplied
by it for inclusion in the Information Statement or Proxy Statement, at the
date the Information Statement or Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC and at
the time of the mailing of the Information Statement, Proxy Statement or any
amendments or supplements thereto, not to contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Sub with
respect to information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Information Statement or Proxy Statement. Each of Parent
and Sub will furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be
set forth in the Information Statement or Proxy Statement promptly following
request therefor from the Company.

 



55 (d) _Mailing of Information Statement or Proxy Statement_. The Company shall,
as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five Business Days after
the earliest of (i) confirmation from the SEC that it has no further comments
on the Information Statement or Proxy Statement, (ii) confirmation from the
SEC that the Information Statement or Proxy Statement is otherwise not to be
reviewed and (iii) expiration of the 10-day period after filing in the event
the SEC does not determine to review the Information Statement or Proxy
Statement, mail the Information Statement or Proxy Statement to (A) in the
case of the Information Statement, stockholders of the Company who are
entitled to receive (1) a notice of action by less than unanimous consent
pursuant to Section 228(e) of the DGCL, (2) a notice of appraisal rights

pursuant to Rule 14c-2 of the Exchange Act and (B) in the case of the Proxy
Statement, stockholders of the Company who were stockholders of record as of
the applicable record date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.04(d)_
shall not be affected by any Change of Recommendation or the commencement,
proposal, disclosure or communication to the Company or any other person of
any Acquisition Proposal.

(e) _Amendments to Information Statement or Proxy Statement_. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective officers or directors
should be discovered by the Company which, pursuant to the Securities Act or
Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Information Statement or Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly inform
Parent. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company agrees to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Information Statement or Proxy Statement which
shall have become false or misleading. Each of the Company and Parent
shall cause all documents that such party is responsible for filing with the
SEC in connection with the Merger to comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and, as applicable, not to contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

Section 6.05 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent and Sub, on the other hand, shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts (i)
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such
parties or their Subsidiaries with respect to the Transactions, including by
providing all information that the other party may reasonably request in
connection therewith (except for documents filed pursuant to Items 4(c),
4(d)(ii) and 4(d)(iii) of the Notification and Report Form For Certain
Mergers And Acquisitions or communications regarding the same), and, subject
to the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , to consummate the Transactions
as promptly as practicable and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the
other parties to obtain) any consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or
any exemption by, any Governmental Entity that is required to be obtained by
them or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
Transactions as promptly as practicable, and to comply with the terms and
conditions of any such consent, authorization, Order or approval.

 



56 (b) Without limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, undertakes and agrees to file (i)
within five (5) Business Days following the date hereof, a Notification and
Report Form under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ "), and (ii) as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, such other filings with any other
Governmental Entities as may be required under any other applicable Antitrust
Laws, to the extent set forth on Section 6.05(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company, as applicable, shall (x)
respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests for additional
information or documentation received from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or
any other Governmental Entity, and (y) not extend any waiting period under
the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with the
FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity not to consummate
the Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Each of
Parent and Sub shall offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to
take) all steps which it is capable of taking to avoid or eliminate
impediments under any Antitrust Laws that are asserted by the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions to the extent necessary to enable the Closing to occur prior to
the Outside Date, and shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in any court by any party, including appeals. Without limiting the
foregoing, each of Parent and Sub shall propose, negotiate, offer to commit
and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or otherwise offer to take
or offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and if
the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the
businesses, services or assets of Parent or its Subsidiaries, in order
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other Order in any suit or proceeding, which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond
the Outside Date. At the request of Parent, the Company shall agree to
divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that
limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of
the businesses, services or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
_provided_ , that any such action shall be conditioned upon the consummation
of the Closing and the Transactions. Parent and Sub shall be solely
responsible for and shall pay all filing fees payable to the FTC,
the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity in connection with
the antitrust, competition or trade regulation matters contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c) Company and Parent shall promptly furnish to each other copies of any
notices or written communications received by it or any of its Affiliates from
any third party or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions,
and Company and Parent shall permit each others counsel an opportunity to
review and comment thereon in advance, and shall consider in good faith the
comments of such counsel in connection with, any proposed written
communications by the Company or Parent, respectively, and/or its Affiliates
to any third party or any Governmental Entity, including the FTC and Antitrust
Division, concerning the

 



57  Transactions. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to provide the other
party and its counsel the opportunity, on reasonable advance notice, to
participate in any substantive meetings or discussions, either in person or
by telephone, between the Company or Parent, respectively, and/or any of its
Affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and any third party or
Governmental Entity, including the FTC and Antitrust Division, on the other
hand, concerning or in connection with the Transactions, to the extent such
participation is permitted by such third party or Governmental Entity.

(d) The Company and Parent shall give (or cause its respective Subsidiaries to
give) any notices to third parties (other than Governmental Entities), and
use, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts
to obtain any consents from third parties (other than Governmental Entities)
that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions. In the
event that either party shall fail to obtain any third party consent
described in the first sentence of this _Section 6.05(d)_, each of the
parties shall cooperate to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and
Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses
resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result, after the
Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any
approval or consent from any Person (other than any Governmental Entity) with
respect to the Transactions, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent,
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to
such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation
due to such Person and (ii) neither Parent nor Sub shall be required to pay or
commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any
cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or
other obligation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person
(other than any Governmental Entity) with respect to the Transactions, none
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay or commit
to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or
other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation due to such Person; _provided_ , that Parent shall reimburse the
Company for any payments made with Parents prior written consent in
accordance with this  _Section 6.05(d)_ prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the
Company shall, upon the direction of Parent and subject to reimbursement by
Parent, so pay or commit to pay all such amounts required.

Section 6.06 _Takeover Law_. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable to
the Merger or the other Transactions after the date of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent and the members of their respective boards of directors (or
equivalent governing body) shall grant such approvals and take such actions as
are reasonably necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated
herein and otherwise act to eliminate if possible, and otherwise to minimize,
the effects of such Takeover Law on the Merger and the other Transactions.

Section 6.07 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither Parent nor the Company shall issue any press release or make any other
public statement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without
the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) and Parent and

 



58  the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any such press release or
other public statement, in each case, except as otherwise may be required by
applicable Law, court process or NYSE rule, regulation or listing agreement,
and except for any matters referred to in _Section 6.03(e)_. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that, promptly following execution of this Agreement,
the Company and Parent shall issue a joint press release in a form mutually
agreed to by the Company and Parent announcing the execution of this Agreement
and the Transactions, and the Company shall file a current report on Form
8-K with the SEC attaching such press release and a copy of this Agreement
and the Support Agreement as exhibits.

 

Section 6.08 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Person
who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, a director or officer of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Companys Organizational Documents,
the Organizational Documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and, for a period of six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time, shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

(b) Without limiting _Section 6.08(a)_ or any rights of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification agreement set forth in Section 6.08(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (such agreements, the " _Disclosed Indemnity
Agreements_ "), from and after the Effective Time, in the event of any
threatened or actual claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (a "
_Claim_ "), whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in
part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact
that the Indemnified Party is or was a director (including in a capacity as a
member of any board committee) or officer of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors, or served as a fiduciary
of any employee benefit plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any
action or failure to take action in any such capacity, or (ii) this Agreement
or any of the Transactions, whether in any case asserted or arising before or
after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (x)
indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by Law and
the Companys or its applicable Subsidiarys Organizational Documents in
effect as of the Effective Time, each such Indemnified Party against any
Damages (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, which shall be
paid or reimbursed in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and the Companys or its applicable Subsidiarys
Organizational Documents in effect as of the Effective Time upon receipt of
any undertaking required by applicable Law or such Organizational
Documents), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in
connection with any such threatened or actual Claim, and (y) comply with the
terms of each Disclosed Indemnity Agreement with respect to such Claim. None
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for which
indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless 

 



59  such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement,
compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate
with an Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for which such
Indemnified Party has validly sought indemnification under any
Disclosed Indemnity Agreement. The Surviving Corporations obligations under
this _Section 6.08(b)_ shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of six years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights
to indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim.

(c) The Company shall obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or
"tail") directors and officers liability insurance policies in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years
from the Effective Time, covering each person who is covered by such policies
on the date of this Agreement on terms with respect to such coverage and
amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than those of such policies in
effect on the date of this Agreement, and such tail policy may not be amended,
modified or cancelled or revoked by the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. In the event the Company does not obtain such "tail" insurance
policies, then, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent
shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party on terms with
respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than
those of such policies in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to pay an aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies to the
extent exceeding 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for coverage
for its last full fiscal year for such insurance (which amount the Company
represents and warrants is set forth in Section 6.08(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule); and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, in the event that the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or a substantial portion of its stock, properties or assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
respectively, shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors
or assigns or transferees, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.08_.

 

(e) From and after the Effective Time (but not prior thereto), the provisions
of this _Section 6.08_ (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will
be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
Representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by Contract or otherwise.

 



60 Section 6.09 _Access; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) During the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) afford to Parent, and to
Parents Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours and
on reasonable notice to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties, books and
records and to those directors, officers and employees of the Company to whom
Parent reasonably requests access, (ii) furnish, as promptly as practicable,
to Parent all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business,
properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel, books and records and
financial information and other aspects of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent may reasonably request, (iii) reasonably cooperate with Parent and its
Representatives to organize and facilitate meetings among Parent and
its Representatives and the Companys Representatives to be located at the
properties, offices or other facilities of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries at such times during normal business hours as Parent may
reasonably request, (iv) use reasonable best efforts to furnish or produce
information related to the financial or Tax records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries if reasonably requested by Parent or its Representatives and (v)
reasonably cooperate with Parent and Parents Representatives with respect to
communications to, and to organize and facilitate meetings with, customers,
suppliers and other key business relations of the Company and each Subsidiary
of the Company as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide any such access or
information to the extent that doing so, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, would (i) cause a waiver of an attorney-client privilege or loss of
attorney work product protection or (ii) constitute a violation of any
applicable Law (including Antitrust Laws) (in each case, it being agreed that
the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding
such access or information and thereafter the Company and Parent shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such access or information,
as applicable, to be provided, or made available, in a manner that would
not reasonably be expected to cause such a waiver or violation).

(b) All information received from the Company or its Representatives under
_Section 6.09(a)_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.10  _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each party hereto shall give
prompt written notice to the other of (a) any Litigation arising out of or
relating to the Transactions or (b) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any
change or event that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
Merger set forth in _Article VII_ not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_
, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.10_ shall not
cure any breach of any representation or warranty, breach of covenant or
failure to satisfy the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice.

Section 6.11 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments (including as such
terms may be modified or adjusted in accordance with the 

 



61  terms of the "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Fee Letter), including
using its reasonable best efforts to (v) maintain in effect the Financing
Commitments in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions
thereof (including "flex" provisions), it being further understood and agreed
that Parent and Sub may not amend, replace, supplement, modify or waive any
provision of the Financing Commitments in any way that would reasonably be
expected to adversely impact or delay in any material respect the ability of
Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger in accordance with this Agreement or
the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing
Commitments, (w) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Financing Commitments on the terms and conditions described therein or
on such other terms acceptable to Parent, Sub and their Financing sources
but only to the extent that any such other terms would not reasonably be
expected to adversely impact or delay in any material respect the ability of
Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger in accordance with this Agreement or
the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing
Commitments, (x) satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent and Sub in such
definitive agreements on or prior to the Closing, (y) consummate the Financing
at or prior to the Closing, and (z) enforce the Debt Commitment Letter.
Parent shall furnish correct and complete copies of all such definitive
agreements to the Company promptly upon their execution, _provided_ that the
same pricing terms, fee amounts and economic terms redacted from the Debt Fee
Letter provided to the Company may be redacted from such definitive
agreements. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current
basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to obtain
and consummate the Financing. Upon any amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification or waiver of any provisions of the Equity Commitment Letters or
Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section 6.11(a)_, the
terms " _Equity Commitment Letters_ " and " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall
mean the Equity Commitment Letters and Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable,
as so amended, replaced, supplemented, modified or waived in accordance with
this _Section 6.11(a)_.

(b) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing Commitments (including
as such terms may be modified or adjusted in accordance with the terms of the
"flex" provisions contained in the Debt Fee Letter) for any reason, Parent and
Sub shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
promptly as practicable but in any event no later than the later of the second
Business Day following (x) the last day of the Marketing Period and (y) the
satisfaction of all of the conditions precedent to Closing set forth in
_Article VII_ , financing from alternative sources (the " _Alternative
Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions and that
in any event (i) are not subject to any conditions to funding the Financing
other than those contained in the Financing Commitments in effect as of the
date hereof and (ii) do not contain any additional terms that would reasonably
be expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Merger beyond
the second Business Day following the later of (x) the last day of the
Marketing Period and (y) the satisfaction of all of the conditions precedent
to Closing set forth in  _Article VII_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
and Sub shall not be required to seek or accept any such Alternative Financing
if the terms or conditions thereof are materially less favorable in the
aggregate to Parent than the Debt Financing to be replaced, including with
respect to the economic terms and conditions (measuring, for this purpose, the
economic terms and conditions of the senior unsecured notes against the
economic terms and conditions of the senior unsecured bridge loans). In the
event that Alternative Financing is arranged in accordance with this _Section
6.11(b)_, the term " _Financing Commitments_ " shall mean the commitment 

 



62  letters for such Alternative Financing (as amended, replaced, supplemented
or modified in accordance with _Section 6.11(a)_). In the event that
Alternative Financing shall be obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.11(b)_,
the parties shall comply with the covenants in _Section 6.11(a)_ with respect
to such Alternative Financing _mutatis mutandis_. Parent shall furnish correct
and complete copies of all definitive agreements relating to the Alternative
Financing to the Company promptly upon their execution, _provided_ that the
pricing terms, fee amounts and economic terms contained in the agreements
governing the Alternative Financing that correspond to such terms that were
redacted from the Debt Fee Letter provided to the Company may also be redacted
from such definitive agreements. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
obtain and consummate the Alternative Financing.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries respective Representatives to, cooperate with Parent in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or Alternative
Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including (i)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-
one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and
prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Debt Financing and the members of
senior management and other representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), drafting sessions, presentations, road shows, rating agency
presentations and due diligence sessions and sessions with prospective
financing sources and investors; (ii) furnishing Parent and the Lender Parties
as promptly as reasonably practicable with such financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, including (A) audited consolidated balance
sheets of the Company for the end of the three (3) most recently completed
fiscal years ended at least 90 calendar days before the Closing Date (assuming
for purposes of this  _Section 6.11(c)_ that the Closing Date occurs at the
conclusion of the Marketing Period) and the related audited statements of
income, stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company for the three most
recently completed fiscal years ended at least 90 calendar days before the
Closing Date; (B) unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related statements
of income, stockholders equity and cash flows related to the Company for the
most recently completed fiscal quarter that is subsequent to the Companys
most recently completed fiscal year and ended at least 45 days prior to the
Closing Date together with the corresponding statements of income,

the prior fiscal year (other than any fiscal fourth quarter) which have been
reviewed in accordance with AU 722 in the case of the financial information
required pursuant to subclause (B), and meeting the requirements of
Regulation S-X and all other accounting rules and regulations of the SEC to
the extent necessary to obtain the customary comfort letters referred to in
subclause (xi) below, in the case of the financial information required
pursuant to subclauses (A) and (B), it being understood and agreed that any
financial information provided in accordance with the foregoing subclause (A)
or (B) shall be of type and form customarily included to sell non-convertible
unsecured debt securities in a private placement under Rule 144A of the
Securities Act; and (C) other information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries of the type that would be required to be included in a
registration statement on Form S-1 pursuant to Regulation S-X and Regulation
S-K under the Securities Act that is customarily included in an offering
document for non-convertible unsecured debt securities in a private placement
under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, with such information
being sufficiently current under the Securities Act to permit a registration
statement of a non-accelerated filer on Form S-1 to be declared effective by
the SEC on the last day of the Marketing Period (it being acknowledged that if
the Company has filed its Annual Reports on Form 10-K with the SEC within 90
days of the end of each fiscal year and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q within
45 days of the end of each fiscal quarter in compliance with the substantive
requirements of such forms, the requirement in this clause (C) to provide
information sufficiently current to permit a registration

 



63  statement of a non-accelerated filer on Form S-1 to be declared effective
will be deemed satisfied), which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not in any
case be required to include (x) information of a type not included in the SEC
Documents and (y) consolidating and other financial statements and data that
would be required by Sections 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X and Item 402 of

party disclosure related to SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A, 34-5402A and IC-27444A
or other information customarily excluded from a Rule 144A offering memorandum
but shall include customary information relating to the guarantors and non-
guarantors (the information referred to in clause (ii), the " _Marketing
Materials_ "); (iii) using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in the
preparation of _pro forma_ financial statements and financial information (of
a type and form customarily included to sell non-convertible unsecured debt
securities in a private placement under Rule 144A of the Securities Act) as of
the dates and for the twelve-month period ending on the last day of the most
recently completed four-fiscal quarter period ended at least 45 days prior to
the Closing Date (or, if the most recently completed fiscal period is the end
of a fiscal year, ended at least 90 days before the Closing Date), in any
case prepared after giving effect to the Transactions as if the Transactions
had occurred as of such date (in the case of a _pro forma_ balance sheet) or
at the beginning of such period (in the case of _pro forma_ statements
of income), provided, that the Company shall only be required to assist in
such preparation with pro forma financial statements if Parent has provided
the Company information relating to the proposed debt and equity
capitalization; (iv) assisting Parent and the Lender Parties in the
preparation of offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, rating agency presentations and lender presentations
relating to the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing; (v) cooperating
with the marketing efforts of Parent and the Lender Parties for all or any
portion of the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing; (vi) cooperating
with Parents legal counsel and counsel to the Lender Parties in connection
with any legal opinions that such legal counsel may be required to deliver in
connection with the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing (including
10b-5 negative assurance); (vii) providing reasonably requested
authorization letters to the Lender Parties with respect to information
provided by the Company contained therein (including with respect to absence
of material non-public information about the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their securities in the public-side version of documents distributed to
prospective lenders); (viii) providing (A) documents reasonably requested by
Parent or the Lender Parties relating to the repayment of the existing

Liens, including customary payoff letters; (B) documentation and other
information required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable "know-
your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
Patriot Act, at least seven Business Days prior to the Closing and (C) an
executed certificate of the individual who will be Chief Financial Officer of
the Company immediately following the Closing with respect to solvency
matters substantially in the form attached to the Debt Commitment Letter,
(ix) using reasonable best efforts to facilitate the execution and delivery,
on the Closing Date, of agreements, documents or certificates that facilitate
the creation, perfection or enforcement of Liens securing the Debt Financing
or the

 



64  Alternative Financing (including original copies of all certificated
securities (with transfer powers executed in blank), control agreements,
surveys, title insurance, landlord consents and access letters), as well as
certificates detailing calculations of availability under the Companys
existing asset-based revolving credit facility, in each case, as are
reasonably requested by Parent or the Lender Parties; (x) cooperating with
the Lender Parties customary securities underwriting and secured lending due
diligence investigation, including cooperating with respect to field
examinations and appraisals, to the extent customary and reasonable; and (xi)
using reasonable best efforts to obtain consents and comfort letters

or private placement of debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act) from the independent auditors of the Company with respect to
the financial statements and information referred to in the foregoing clause
(ii) (including customary "negative assurance" comfort) as may be reasonably
requested by Parent including the provision of appropriate representations to
such independent auditors. If the Company at any point believes that it has
delivered the Marketing Materials in accordance with this _Section 6.11(c)_,
it may deliver to Parent a written notice to such effect, in which case the
Company shall be deemed to have delivered the Marketing Materials unless
Parent in good faith reasonably believes that the Company has not completed
delivery of the Marketing Materials and within three (3) Business Days after
receipt of such notice Parent shall provide to the Company a written notice
stating with specificity what information that constitutes Marketing Materials
the Company has not delivered; _provided_ that the Company shall have no
obligation to provide (1) any financial information (other than the financial
statements or other information referred to in this _Section 6.11(c)_)
concerning the Company that the Company does not maintain in the ordinary
course of business, or (2) any other information not reasonably available to
the Company under its current reporting systems, unless any such information
referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) or (2) would be required
so that any offering document would not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which that were made, not misleading.

(d) Parent shall, regardless of whether the Closing shall occur, (i) indemnify
and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries from and against any
liability or obligation suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries provided by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in writing specifically for use in the Financing
offering documents) and (ii) promptly upon the Companys request, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with its compliance with _Section 6.11(d)_. 

(e) The Company hereby consents to the use of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing or the Alternative
Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used in a manner that is not
intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 6.11_, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to commit to take any
corporate or other organizational action or execute any agreement or undertake
any contractual obligation that is

 



65  not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the
Effective Time. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries shall (A) be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee relating to the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Financing, unless and until the Closing occurs,
(B) have any liability or obligation under any loan agreement or any related
document or any other agreement or document related to the Debt Financing (or
any Alternative Financing) (other than the authorization and representation
letters referred to above), unless and until the Closing occurs, (C)
be required to incur any other liability in connection with the Financing (or
any Alternative Financing) unless reimbursed or indemnified by Parent and/or
Sub to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company or (D) be required to
provide any information to the extent that provision thereof would violate
any Law.

(g) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice (and, in any event,
within 24 hours of becoming aware of such event) of (i) any material breach by
any party of any term or condition of the Financing Commitments (or
commitments for any Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this
_Section 6.11_) of which Parent becomes aware, (ii) any termination of the
Financing Commitments (or commitments for any Alternative Financing obtained
in accordance with this _Section 6.11_) or (iii) the occurrence or non-
occurrence, of any change or event that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to cause any condition precedent of the Financing
(or any Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this  _Section
6.11_) to not be satisfied at the Closing Date.

Section 6.12 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such steps as may be required or advisable to cause dispositions of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with
this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company
(including a director by deputization) to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.13 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. The Company shall cooperate with
Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and the rules and policies of
the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Company of the Class A Common Stock
from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Class A Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

Section 6.14 _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Company shall deliver to Parent, at the
Effective Time, a properly completed and executed certificate to the effect
that the Company Common Stock is not a U.S. real property interest (such
certificate in the form required by Treasury Regulation Sections 1.897-2(h)
and 1.1445-2(c)(3)).

Section 6.15 _Employees_. Except as may otherwise be negotiated between Parent
and any Management Level Employee with respect to his or her own compensation
and employee benefits, after the Effective Time, Parent currently intends to
continue to employ the Companys and its Subsidiaries employees and provide
such employees with a level of compensation and employee benefits
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the level of compensation and
employee benefits provided to such employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including with respect to salaries, severance benefits and
other compensation,

 



66  exclusive of Company Stock Options, Restricted Stock and any other equity
compensation. Nothing in this _Section 6.15_ shall create any third-party
beneficiary right in any Person other than the parties to this Agreement, or
create any right to continued employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section
6.15_ shall constitute an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or any other
similar plan or arrangement or shall prevent the amendment or termination of
any such Company Benefit Plan, plan or arrangement.

Section 6.16 _Obligations of Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 6.17 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent of, and shall give Parent and Sub the opportunity to participate in
the defense of, any Litigation brought by the Companys stockholders against
the Company and/or members of the Board of Directors relating to the
Transactions and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the
status thereof; provided, however, that the Company shall not compromise,
settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or
come to an arrangement regarding any Litigation arising or resulting from the
Transactions, or consent to the same, without the prior written consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

this Agreement shall relieve or otherwise affect the liability of any party
hereto for any willful and intentional breach of this Agreement by such party
prior to such termination. For purposes hereof, a "willful and intentional
breach" shall mean a material breach of any material representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement that is a
consequence of an act undertaken or failure to act by the breaching party with
the actual knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to act would cause
a breach of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section 9.06_, each of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges

current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates (collectively,

and intentional, of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or the
failure of the Merger to be consummated) or the Transactions, and upon payment
of the Reverse Break-Up Fee to the Company pursuant to  _Section 8.04_, none
of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
to any of the Company Related Parties relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions (except that Parent shall continue to be
obligated to the Company for amounts payable under _Section 8.04(c)_ and the
indemnification, cost and expense reimbursement and other obligations

or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate or
partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or
another person or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, and to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, in no event shall Parent, Sub or any of
the Parent Related Parties have any liability for Damages (as distinguished

excess of an aggregate amount equal to, or other than in respect of, the
Reverse Break-up Fee plus amounts payable under _Section 8.04(c)_ and the

contained in _Section 6.11(d)_, whether to the Company or to any of the
Company Related Parties.

 



71 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to  _Section 9.06_, each of the parties hereto expressly
acknowledges and agrees that, Parents right to receive payment of the Break-
Up Fee pursuant to _Section 8.05_, in circumstances in which the Break-Up Fee
is payable, shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent Related
Parties against the Company Related Parties for all Damages in respect of this
Agreement (including in respect of any breach, whether or not willful and
intentional, of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or the
failure of the Merger to be consummated) or the Transactions in such
circumstances, and upon payment of the Break-Up Fee to Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.05_, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation to any of the Parent Related Parties relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

(d) Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement may only be brought against persons that are expressly named as
parties hereto, and then only with respect to the specific obligations set
forth herein. Other than (i) each Sponsor under its Limited Guaranty, (ii)
subject to _Section 9.06_, each Sponsor under its Equity Commitment Letter,

breach, termination or failure to consummate such Transactions), in each case
whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,

piercing of the corporate or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of a party hereto or another person or otherwise.

connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger
or the other Transactions are consummated.

Section 8.04 _Reverse Break-Up Fee_.

in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ have been 

 



72  satisfied (other than those conditions (x) that require deliveries or are
tested at the time of Closing, which conditions would have been satisfied if
the Closing had occurred at the time of such termination, or (y) the failure
of which to be satisfied primarily results from a breach by Parent or Sub of
any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement), or (B) by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.01(e)_, (ii) in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_ or
_Section 8.01(e)_, the Company is not in material violation of its
obligations under  _Section 6.11(c)_, and (iii) in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_ or _Section 8.01(e)_, the Marketing Period
shall have ended, then the Reverse Break-Up Fee shall be payable in accordance
with  _Section 8.04(b)_.

(b) In the event the Reverse Break-Up Fee is payable, such fee shall be paid
by Parent in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by the Company, within two (2) Business Days
after the date on which this Agreement is terminated.

 

(c) If Parent fails to promptly pay the Reverse Break-Up Fee when due, and, in
order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that results in a
judgment against Parent for the amount of the Reverse Break-Up Fee or any
portion thereof, Parent shall pay to the Company, as applicable, (i) its costs
and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel)
in connection with such suit, and (ii) interest on the amount payable
pursuant to such judgment, compounded quarterly, at the prime lending rate
prevailing during such period as published in the _Wall Street Journal_ ,
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid until the date of actual payment.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Reverse Break-Up Fee_ " means a non-
refundable cash payment in an amount equal to $45,126,722.

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.04_ are an integral part of the Transactions,
and that without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this
Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 8.04_ do
not constitute a penalty.

(f) Nothing in this _Section 8.04_ shall limit the entitlement of the parties
to obtain an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
pursuant to and in accordance with  _Section 9.06_.

Section 8.05 _Break-Up Fee; Expense Reimbursement_.

 

(a) If the Break-Up Fee has not already been paid pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, and this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.01(f)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(h)_ or (ii) by
(A) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_, (B) Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 8.01(c)_ at a time when this Agreement was terminable by Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ or (C) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_
and, in the case of this clause (ii), within twelve months following such
termination, the Company either (1) consummates any of the transactions
described in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" with another Person or
(2) enters into a letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or Contract
with another Person with respect to any of the transactions described in the
definition

 



73  of "Acquisition Proposal", which transaction is ultimately consummated
(whether or not such consummation occurs within twelve months following such
termination), then, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), the Company
shall pay to Parent the Break-Up Fee; _provided_ , that for purposes of this
_Section 8.05(a)_, references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Break-Up Fee_ " means a non-refundable

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_,
the Company shall pay to Parent (i) an amount equal to $6,942,573 (the "

incurred in connection with its investigation, consideration, documentation,
diligence and negotiation of this Agreement and the Transactions, including
all fees and expenses of Parents and Subs legal counsel, accountants,
consultants, investment bankers and financing sources, including commitment
fees paid pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitments (the " _Expense
Reimbursement_ ").

(d) In the event the Break-Up Fee, Early Break-Up Fee or Expense
Reimbursement is payable, such fee shall be paid by Company in cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by Parent, which payment shall be made prior to or contemporaneously with
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(h)_ or within
two (2) Business Days after the date on which this Agreement is terminated for
any other circumstances set forth in _Section 8.05(a)_ or _8.05(c)_ ; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event the Break-Up Fee is payable
pursuant to _Section 8.05(a)(ii)_, such payment shall be made within two
Business Days after the date on which the Company consummates the Acquisition
Proposal transaction.

(e) If Company fails to promptly pay the Break-Up Fee, Early Break-Up Fee or
Expense Reimbursement when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a final and non-appealable judgment against
Company for the amount of the Break-Up Fee, Early Break-Up Fee or Expense
Reimbursement or any portion thereof, Company shall pay to Parent, as
applicable, (i) its costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel) in connection with such suit, and (ii) interest on the amount
payable pursuant to such judgment, compounded quarterly, at the prime lending
rate prevailing during such period as published in the _Wall Street Journal_ ,
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid until the date of actual payment.

 

(f) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.05_ are an integral part of the Transactions,
and that without these agreements, Parent and Sub would not enter into this
Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 8.05_ do
not constitute a penalty.

 

(g) Nothing in this _Section 8.05_ shall limit the entitlement of the parties
to obtain an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as
contemplated by _Section 9.06_.

 



74 ARTICLE IX.

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 9.01 _Survival_. None of the representations and warranties in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time. None of the covenants of any party hereto required
to be performed by such party before the Closing shall survive the Closing;
_provided_ that, unless otherwise indicated, the covenants and agreements set
forth in this Agreement which by their terms are required to be performed
after the Closing shall survive the Closing until they have been performed or
satisfied.

Section 9.02 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall
be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders
of the Company without such approval having been obtained. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
_Section 8.02(b)_,  _Section 8.02(d)_, this _Section 9.02_, _Section
9.06(f)_, _Section 9.07_ and _Section 9.11(b)_ (and any provision of this
Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of
such provision would modify the substance of _Section 8.02(b)_, _Section
8.02(d)_, this _Section 9.02_, _Section 9.06(f)_, _Section 9.07_ or
_Section 9.11(b))_ may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner
that impacts or is adverse in any respect to the Lender Parties without the
prior written consent of the Lender Parties.

Section 9.03 _Counterparts; Facsimile and Electronic Signatures_. This
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties. This Agreement or any counterpart may be executed and delivered
by facsimile copies or delivered by electronic communications by portable
document format (.pdf), each of which shall be deemed an original to the other
parties.

 

Section 9.04 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the agreements, instruments
and documents contemplated hereby shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws
that might apply under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 

Section 9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are
fulfilled to the extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
intend that the remedies and limitations set forth in this Agreement
(including _Section 8.02_, _Section 8.04_,

 



75   _Section 8.05_, _Section 9.06_, _Section 9.07_ and _Section 9.11(b)_)
shall be construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and that such
remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases
(a) the liability of any party (or the liability of any Company Related Party
or Parent Related Party) or (b) the obligations hereunder or under the Limited
Guarantees. 

Section 9.06 _Specific Performance; Jurisdiction; Enforcement_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of
this Agreement would not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. Except
as otherwise set forth in this _Section 9.06_, including the limitations set
forth herein, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, in the event of any
breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or
Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations
set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Sub,
on the other hand, shall, subject to _Section 9.06(b)_, be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the other and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other
under this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that, in addition to its rights to enforce directly the Equity
Financing Letter in accordance with its terms, the Company shall be entitled
to specific performance of Parents and Subs obligations to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to consummate the Transactions, solely in the event
that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and  _Section 7.02_ have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that require deliveries or are tested
at the time of Closing, which conditions would have been satisfied if the
Closing had occurred at the time of such termination), and Parent or Sub
fails to complete the Closing at the date specified to be the Closing Date in
accordance with _Section 2.02_, (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed by written notice to
Parent that (x) all conditions set forth in _Section 7.03_ have been
satisfied (other than those that require deliveries or are tested at the
time of Closing, which conditions would have been satisfied if the Closing
had occurred at the time of such termination) or that it has waived any
unsatisfied conditions in _Section 7.03_ and (y) it is prepared to consummate
the Merger at the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not
be entitled to enforce specifically (i) Parents or Subs right to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded or (ii) Parents or Subs obligation
to consummate the Merger if in either case the Debt Financing has not been
funded and will not be funded at the Closing (subject only to the condition
that the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing).

 

(c) Subject to _Section 9.06(b)_, each party hereto hereby agrees not to
raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by such party,
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of such party under this Agreement all in

 



76  accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.06_. Any party hereto seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such order
or injunction all in accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.06_. Each
party hereto further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this _Section 9.06_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that is available to such party under the express
terms of this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters or each Limited
Guaranty in the event that this Agreement is terminated, and (ii) nothing set
forth in this _Section 9.06_ shall require any party hereto to institute any
proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance under this _Section 9.06_ prior to, or as a condition
to, exercising any termination right under _Article VIII_ , nor shall the
commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this  _Section 9.06_ or
anything set forth in this _Section 9.06_ restrict or limit any partys right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VIII_. If
a court has declined to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent or Sub
to take all actions under this Agreement up to and including the consummation
of the Merger pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against
Parent or Sub pursuant to this _Section 9.06_, then the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company will be payment of the Reverse Break-up Fee in
accordance with the terms and conditions of _Section 8.04_. In addition, the
Company agrees to cause any action or proceeding commenced by the Company and
pending in connection with this Agreement against Parent or Sub to be
dismissed with prejudice promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business
Days, after such time as Parent or Sub consummates the Transactions pursuant
to this  _Section 9.06_. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific performance to the extent permitted by this
_Section 9.06_ and the payment of the Reverse Break-up Fee pursuant to 
_Section 8.04_, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to require Parent or
Sub to consummate the Transactions and payment of the Reverse Break-up Fee.

 

(d) Each of the parties irrevocably (i) submits itself to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or in the event,
but only in the event, that such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, the Superior Court of the State
of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware)
for the purpose of any Litigation directly or indirectly based upon, relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the Transactions or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, (ii) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court and (iii) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any court
other than the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or in the event, but
only in the event, that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction
over such action or proceeding, in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware
or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware). Each of
the parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Litigation with
respect to this Agreement, (x) any claim that it is not personally subject
to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the
failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 9.06_, (y) any claim that
it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (z) to the fullest extent 

 



77  permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit, action or
proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of
such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the
subject matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

(e) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to service being made
through the notice procedures set forth in _Section 9.08_ and agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by personal delivery to
the respective addresses set forth in _Section 9.08_ shall be effective
service of process for any Litigation in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions. Nothing in this _Section 9.06_ shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company and its Subsidiaries each: (i) agrees that it will not bring or
support any Person in any action, suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the
Lender Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New York state
courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York, to the
extent that such courts have jurisdiction over the Lender Parties; (ii)
agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) against any of the Lender Parties in any way relating to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving
effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the extent such
principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of another
jurisdiction; and (iii) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
(whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise)
directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
except for claims by Parent or Sub against the Lender Parties pursuant to the
Debt Commitment Letter and any definitive documents related thereto, (A) none
of the parties hereto nor any of their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or
stockholders shall have any rights or claims against any Lender Party in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, or in respect of
any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise and (B) no Lender Party shall have any liability (whether in
contract, in tort or otherwise) to any party hereto or any of their
respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities
of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether

 



78  at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. None of the limitations
in this _Section 9.06(f)_ shall be deemed to affect any partys right to seek
specific performance pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 9.06_. The
Lender Parties are intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section
9.06(f)_.

Section 9.07 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR
THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY,
INCLUDING IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY LENDER PARTY.
EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) EACH PARTY HERETO UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER, (c) EACH PARTY HERETO MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (d) EACH PARTY HERETO HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 9.07_.

 

Section 9.08 _Notices_. Except for notices that are specifically required by

Section 9.09 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned (in whole or
in part) by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any
such assignment without such consent shall be null and void and of no effect;
_provided,_ _however_ , that each of Parent and Sub may assign this Agreement
and its rights hereunder without the prior written consent of the Company to
any of their respective financing 

 



80  sources (including the Lender Parties) pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent necessary for purposes of creating a security
interest herein or otherwise assigning this Agreement and its rights
hereunder as collateral in respect of the Debt Financing. No assignment by any
party shall relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to
the preceding sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall
inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 9.10 _Further Assurances_. The parties agree to execute and deliver to
each other such other documents and to do such other acts and things, all as
the other party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the
intent of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.

 

Section 9.11 _Entire Agreement; Benefit_.

(a) This Agreement (together with the Exhibits hereto), the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Support Agreement constitute
the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

(b) Neither this Agreement nor any other agreement contemplated hereby is
intended to or shall confer upon any person other than the parties hereto and
thereto any legal or equitable rights or remedies except as provided in
_Section 6.08(e)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lender Parties shall be
express third party beneficiaries of _Section 8.02(b)_, _Section 8.02(d)_,
_Section 9.02_,  _Section 9.05_, _Section 9.06(f)_, _Section 9.07_ and
this _Section 9.11(b)_ (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent a
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify
the substance of _Section 8.02(b)_, _Section 8.02(d)_, _Section 9.02_,
_Section 9.05_, _Section 9.06(f)_, _Section 9.07_ or this _Section
9.11(b))_, each of such Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of the
Lender Parties and the Lender Parties shall be entitled to rely on and enforce
the provisions of such Sections.

(c) The representations and warranties set forth in _Articles IV_ and _V_ have
been made solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and (i) are
intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the
risk among the parties if those statements prove to be inaccurate; and (ii)
have been qualified by reference to the Company Disclosure Schedule which
contain certain disclosures that are not reflected in the text of this
Agreement.

Section 9.12 _Extension; Waiver_.

 

(a) At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto may (i) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other parties hereto, (ii) to the extent permitted by Law, waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein by any
other party or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
pursuant hereto by any other applicable party or (iii) subject to the
provision to the first sentence of _Section 9.02_ and to the extent permitted
by Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party.

 



81 (b) The failure of any party to this Agreement to exercise any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver by such party
of such right.

Section 9.13 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. All capitalized terms not defined
in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall have the meanings ascribed to them in
this Agreement. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
the Company set forth in this Agreement are made and given subject to, and
are qualified by, the Company Disclosure Schedule. Any disclosure set forth in
one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to apply to and qualify the section or subsection of this Agreement to which
it corresponds in number and each other section or subsection of this
Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such
information is relevant to such other section or subsection. The Company
Disclosure Schedule includes brief descriptions or summaries of certain
agreements and instruments. The descriptions or summaries do not purport to be
comprehensive and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of
the documents described. No disclosure set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule relating to any possible breach or violation of any Contract or Law
shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred. The inclusion of any information
in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment that such information (a) is required by the terms of this
Agreement to be disclosed, (b) is material to the Company, its Subsidiaries
or any other party, (c) has resulted in or would result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or (d) is outside the ordinary course of business. Matters
reflected in the Company Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Company Disclosure
Schedule. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and
do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.

 

Section 9.14 _Interpretation_.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or Section, such
reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated.

 

(b) The table of contents, headings and index of defined terms contained in

limitation." The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and
effect of the word "shall". The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to
which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply
"if". The word "or" shall be deemed to mean "and/or."

(d) All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when
used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant thereto
unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and
to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.

available to Parent, Sub or their Representatives shall be deemed to mean
uploaded to and made available to Parent, Sub and their Representatives in the
on-line data room hosted on behalf of the Company in the on-line workspace
captioned "Folder" or otherwise being in the possession of Parent, Sub or
their Representatives (and in such case accessible without limitation to
Parent and Sub).

(f) Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in
any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

(g) Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of
this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the
parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

(h) Reference to any Person includes such Persons successors and assigns but,
if applicable, only if such successors and assigns are not prohibited by this
Agreement, and reference to a Person in a particular capacity excludes such
Person in any other capacity or individually.
