the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Seller Parties desire to

Present Value plus the amount of any such Section 2.4 Cash; provided, that

Transaction, the Seller Parties shall calculate the Adjustment Amount (which
may be zero) and deliver written notice of the amount so calculated, together
with such materials supporting such calculation as they may elect to provide
or as may be reasonably requested by the Conflicts Committee, to the Buyer
Parties in care of the Conflicts Committee. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Buyer Parties shall have 60 days to accept or reject such amount(s) submitted
by the Seller Parties and to deliver written notice of such acceptance or
rejection back to the Seller Parties. In the event of acceptance, within five
days of the receipt thereof, the Seller Parties shall pay to the Partnership
the Adjustment Amount by wire or interbank transfer of immediately available
funds to the account(s) specified by the Partnership. In the event of
rejection, the Adjustment Amount shall be determined in the manner provided
in _Section 2.4(d)_.  
      
    | (c)  |   | If the Section 2.4 Transaction is a sale of all of the
Partnerships interest in the Section 2.4 Volumes, then if, within 12 months
following the closing of such sale, the Buyer Parties or any of their
subsidiaries enter into one or more agreements or other arrangement for the
gathering or processing of Section 2.4 Volumes, the Buyer Parties shall pay
to the Seller Parties an amount (the "Refund Amount") the present value of
the EBITDA to be received pursuant to any such agreements, which present
value shall be calculated in a manner consistent with the calculation of the
Adjustment Amount; _provided_ , that the Refund Amount may not exceed the
Adjustment Amount. Within 30 days following the execution of such an
agreement, the Seller Parties shall calculate the Refund Amount, if any, and
deliver written notice of the amount so calculated, together with such
materials supporting such calculation as they may elect to provide, to the
Buyer Parties in care of the Conflicts Committee. Upon receipt of such
notice, the Buyer Parties shall have 60 days to accept or reject the
amount submitted by the Seller Parties and to deliver written notice of such
acceptance or rejection back to the Seller Parties. In the event of
acceptance, within five days of the receipt thereof, the Buyer Parties shall
pay to the Seller Parties the Refund Amount by wire or interbank transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) specified by  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | the Seller Parties. In the event of rejection, the
Refund Amount shall be determined in the manner provided in _Section
2.4(d)_.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (d)  |   | If the Buyer Parties reject the calculation of the
Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ and/or the calculation of the
Refund Amount pursuant to  _Section 2.4(c)_, the determination of such
amounts shall be resolved by referring the disputed amounts for resolution to
a firm of independent accountants of nationally recognized standing (the
"Accounting Referee") to be selected in the following manner: (i) the Parties
shall have seven days following the expiration of the time periods referred
to in such sections, to mutually agree on the identity of the Accounting
Referee or, (ii) if the Parties are unable to agree on an Accounting
Referee pursuant to the preceding clause (i), the Seller Parties will select
three candidates and deliver a written notice containing the names of such
candidates to the Buyer Parties (in care of the Conflicts Committee) within
five days of the expiration of the seven-day period referred to in the
preceding clause (i) and within five days of receiving such notice, the Buyer
Parties will select one of such three candidates to serve as the Accounting
Referee. The Accounting Referee may not be otherwise engaged by the Seller
Parties or the Buyer Parties, or their respective affiliates, in connection
with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and may not
have performed any material services on behalf of the Seller Parties or the
Buyer Parties, or their respective affiliates, during the three years
immediately preceding the date of this Agreement. Once the Accounting Referee
has been selected, the Seller Parties and the Buyer Parties shall each submit
their respective calculations of the disputed amounts to the Accounting
Referee, together with any supporting materials, within five days. After
receipt thereof, the Accounting Referee shall determine the disputed amounts
in the manner provided in this _Section 2.4_ within thirty (30) days; 
_provided,_ the amount of the Adjustment Amount or Refund Amount, as
applicable, determined by the Accounting Referee shall be no greater than the
higher amount submitted and no lower than the lower amount submitted. The
authority of the Accounting Referee shall be limited to determining disputed
amounts submitted to it. The Accounting Referee shall have no right or
authority to award interest or penalties or to grant or award damages of any
kind (including indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages). The
determination of such amounts by the Accounting Referee shall be final and
binding on the Parties. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall
be borne equally by the Seller Parties, on one hand, and the Buyer Parties,
on the other hand. Within five days of the receipt of a calculation by
the Accounting Referee, (i) the Seller Parties shall (in the case of the
Adjustment Amount) and (ii) the Buyer Parties shall (in the case of the
Refund Amount), in either case, pay such amount by wire or interbank transfer
of immediately available funds to the account(s) specified by the other
Party.

similar representatives, including, but not limited to, any "employee
benefit plan" as defined in section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") (the foregoing are hereinafter

which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is and has
been so qualified in form and operation, and (ii) each Plan in which
Associated Employees participate is and has been maintained in material
compliance with its terms and the provisions of all applicable laws, rules
and regulations, including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code.

obligation to contribute to within the past six years, (i) except for an
event described in Section 4043(c)(3) of ERISA, there has been no "reportable
event," as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA, for which
the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not result in such a reportable event for
which a waiver does not apply, (ii) neither the Seller Parties nor any member
of the Seller Aggregated Group has incurred any direct or indirect liability
under Title IV of ERISA other than liability for premiums to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation which have been timely paid other than any
liabilities for which Four Corners LLC has no responsibility or obligation
and (iii) there does not exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the
meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not
waived that, in either case, would give rise to a Lien on any of Four Corners
LLCs assets or that would reasonably be expected to result in a Four Corners
Material Adverse Effect. Other  
    

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | than any liabilities for which Four Corners LLC has
no responsibility or obligation, neither a Seller Party nor any member of the
Seller Aggregated Group contributes to, or has an obligation to contribute
to, and has not within six years prior to the Effective Time contributed to,
or had an obligation to contribute to, a "multiemployer plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA in respect of which a Seller Party or any
member of the Seller Aggregated Group has or may reasonably be expected to
incur any withdrawal liability (as defined in Section 4201 of ERISA) that
would reasonably be expected to result in a Four Corners Material Adverse
Effect.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | Except as would not result in any liability to Four
Corners LLC, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any subsequent employment-related
event) result in any payment becoming due, result in the acceleration of the
time of payment or vesting of any such benefits, result in the incurrence or
acceleration of any other obligation related to the Plans or to any employee
or former employee of the Seller Parties or any of their Affiliates.  
   

  

     3.15  |   | _Transactions with Affiliates_.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Except as set forth on _Disclosure Schedule 3.15_ or as will
be terminated at Closing, Four Corners LLC is not party to any agreement,
contract or arrangement between Four Corners LLC, on the one hand, and the

    |   | None of the Seller Parties, Williams or Four Corners LLC has
entered (directly or indirectly) into any agreement with any person, firm or
corporation that would obligate the Buyer Parties or Four Corners LLC to pay
any commission, brokerage or "finders fee" or other fee in connection with
this Agreement, the Contribution Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.  
      
  3.19  |   | _Liabilities Associated with Natural Gas Contracts_. 



 There has been no misallocation, calculation error, measurement problem or
similar event relating to the performance by Four Corners LLC or
its predecessors under any natural gas gathering, processing or
treating contract that would give rise to a correcting adjustment under any
such contract that would reasonably be expected to result in a liability
to Four Corners LLC in excess of $2,500,000.  
      
  3.20  |   | _Investment Intent_.

Notwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, in the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ or if any party is
otherwise in breach of this Agreement, (a) such breaching party or parties
shall remain liable for its or their obligations under _Article 7_ and/or
_Article 9_. and (b) such termination shall not relieve such breaching party
of any liability for a willful breach of any covenant or agreement under this
Agreement or be deemed a waiver of any available remedy (including specific
performance, if available) for any such breach.

 INDEMNIFICATION UPON CLOSING 

   

     9.1  |   | _Indemnification of the Buyer Parties and Four Corners
LLC_.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the
Seller Parties, from and after the Closing Date, shall indemnify, defend and
hold the Buyer Parties, their subsidiaries and their respective
securityholders, directors, officers, and employees (and the
officers, directors and employees of the General Partner but otherwise
excluding any of the Seller Parties and their Affiliates) (the "Buyer
Indemnified Parties") and Four Corners LLC harmless from and against any and
all Damages suffered or incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party and/or Four
Corners LLC as a result of or arising out of (i) any breach of
a representation or warranty of the Seller Parties in this Agreement or any
Seller Ancillary Document, (ii) any breach of any agreement or covenant on
the part of the Seller Parties made under this Agreement or any Seller
Ancillary Document or in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby
or thereby or (iii) any breach or violation of any Environmental Laws by Four
Corners LLC or relating to its assets, operations or businesses that occurs
prior to Closing.  
      
  9.2  |   | _Indemnification of the Seller Parties_.  
      
    |   | Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the
Buyer Parties shall indemnify, defend and hold the Seller Parties, their
Affiliates (other than any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and Four Corners
LLC) and their respective securityholders, directors, officers, and employees
(the "Seller Indemnified Parties) harmless from and against any and all
Damages suffered or incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties as a result of
or arising out of (i) any breach of a representation or warranty of the Buyer
Parties in this Agreement or any Buyer Ancillary Document, (ii) any breach of
any agreement or covenant on the part of the Buyer Parties made under this
Agreement or any Buyer Ancillary Document or in connection with the
transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or (iii) any breach or violation of
any Environmental Laws by Four Corners LLC or relating to its assets,
operations or businesses that occurs after Closing.  
      
  9.3  |   | _Tax Indemnification_.  
      
    |   | With the exception of a breach of the representations and
warranties of the Seller Parties contained in _Section 3.9_, nothing in this
_Article 9_ shall apply to liability with respect to Taxes, the liability
with respect to which shall be as set forth in  _Article 7_.  
      
  9.4  |   | _Survival_.  
      
    |   | All the provisions of this Agreement shall survive the Closing,
notwithstanding any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of any
party hereto, provided that the representations and warranties set forth in
_Articles 3_ and _4_ and in any certificate delivered in connection herewith
with respect to any of those representations and warranties shall terminate
and expire on December 20, 2007, except (a) the representations and
warranties of the Seller Parties set forth in _Section 3.9_ shall survive
until 30 days after the expiration of the applicable statutes of
limitations (including all periods of extension and tolling),  
   

  ##### 

  

   

        | (b)  |   | the representations and warranties of the
Seller Parties set forth in _Section 3.6_ , _Section 3.10_ and _Section
3.14_ shall terminate and expire on the third anniversary of the Closing
Date, (c) the representations and warranties of the Seller Parties set forth
in _Sections 3.1_, _3.2_ and _3.4_ shall survive forever and (d) the
representations and warranties of the Buyer Parties set forth in

representation and warranty has terminated and expired, no indemnification
shall or may be sought pursuant to this _Article 9_ on the basis of that
representation and warranty by any Person who would have been entitled
pursuant to this _Article 9_ to indemnification on the basis of that
representation and warranty prior to its termination and expiration, provided
that in the case of each representation and warranty that shall terminate and
expire as provided in this _Section 9.3_, no claim presented in writing for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ on the basis of that
representation and warranty prior to its termination and expiration shall be
affected in any way by that termination and expiration. The indemnification
obligations under this _Article 9_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
apply regardless of whether any suit or action results solely or in part from
the active, passive or concurrent negligence or strict liability of the
indemnified party. The covenants and agreements entered into pursuant to this
Agreement to be performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     9.5  |   | _Demands_.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Each indemnified party hereunder agrees that promptly upon its
discovery of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the provisions
of this Agreement, including receipt by it of notice of any demand,
assertion, claim, action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any third
party (such claims for indemnity involving third party claims
being collectively referred to herein as the "Indemnity Claim"), with respect
to any matter as to which it claims to be entitled to indemnity under the
provisions of this Agreement, it will give prompt notice thereof in writing
to the indemnifying party, together with a statement of such information
respecting any of the foregoing as it shall have. Such notice shall include a
formal demand for indemnification under this Agreement.  
      
    |   | If the indemnified party knowingly failed to notify the
indemnifying party thereof in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement in sufficient time to permit the indemnifying party or its counsel
to defend against an Indemnity Claim and to make a timely response thereto,
the indemnifying partys indemnity obligation relating to such
Indemnity Claim shall be limited to the extent that such failure has actually
prejudiced or damaged the indemnifying party with respect to that Indemnity
Claim.  
      
  9.6  |   | _Right to Contest and Defend_.  
      
    |   | The indemnifying party shall be entitled, at its cost and
expense, to contest and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings any
Indemnity Claim for which it is called upon to indemnify the indemnified
party under the provisions of this Agreement; provided, that notice of the
intention to so contest shall be delivered by the indemnifying party to
the indemnified party within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt by the
indemnifying party of notice by the indemnified party of the assertion of the
Indemnity Claim. Any such contest may be conducted in the name and on behalf
of the indemnifying party or  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   | the indemnified party as may be appropriate. Such contest
shall be conducted by reputable counsel employed by the indemnifying party
and not reasonably objected to by the indemnified party, but the indemnified
party shall have the right but not the obligation to participate in such
proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at its sole
cost and expense.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The indemnifying party shall have full authority to determine
all action to be taken with respect thereto; _provided, however_ , that the
indemnifying party will not have the authority to subject the indemnified
party to any obligation whatsoever, other than the performance of purely
ministerial tasks or obligations not involving material expense or injunctive
relief. If the indemnifying party does not elect to contest any such
Indemnity Claim, the indemnifying party shall be bound by the result obtained
with respect thereto by the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of an Indemnity Claim, the indemnified party shall agree
to any settlement, compromise or discharge of an Indemnity Claim that the
indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates
the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection
with such Indemnity Claim, which releases the indemnified party completely in
connection with such Indemnity Claim and which would not otherwise adversely
affect the indemnified party as determined by the indemnified party in its
sole discretion.  
      
    |   | Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not
be entitled to assume the defense of any Indemnity Claim (and shall be liable
for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the indemnified
party in defending such Indemnity Claim) if the Indemnity Claim seeks an
order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money
damages against the indemnified party which the indemnified party
reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be
separated from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief
or other relief portion of the Indemnity Claim can be so separated from that
for money damages, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the
defense of the portion relating to money damages.  
      
  9.7  |   | _Cooperation_.  
      
    |   | If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party
agrees to cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in contesting
any Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest or, if
appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting the
Indemnity Claim, or any cross-complaint against any person, and
the indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for any expenses
incurred by it in so cooperating. At no cost or expense to the indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified party and
its counsel in contesting any Indemnity Claim.  
      
  9.8  |   | _Right to Participate_.  
      
    |   | The indemnified party agrees to afford the indemnifying party
and its counsel the opportunity to be present at, and to participate in,
conferences with all Persons, including Governmental Authorities, asserting
any Indemnity Claim against the indemnified party or conferences with
representatives of or counsel for such Persons.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     9.9  |   | _Payment of Damages_.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The indemnification required hereunder shall be made by
periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the
investigation or defense, within ten (10) days as and when reasonably
specific bills are received or loss, liability, claim, damage or expense
is incurred and reasonable evidence thereof is delivered. In calculating any
amount to be paid by an indemnifying party by reason of the provisions of
this Agreement, the amount shall be reduced by all insurance proceeds and any
indemnification reimbursement proceeds received from third parties credited
to or received by the other party related to the Damages.  
      
  9.10  |   | _Limitations on Indemnification_.  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | To the extent that the Buyer Indemnified Parties
are entitled to indemnification for Damages pursuant to _Section 9.1_, the
Seller Parties shall be liable only for those Damages which exceed, in the
aggregate, $5.0 million (the "Deductible Amount"), and then only to the
extent of any such excess. In no event shall the Seller Parties aggregate
liability to the Buyer Indemnified Parties and Four Corners LLC under
_Section 9.1_ exceed $150.0 million (the "Ceiling Amount"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) the Deductible Amount shall not apply to breaches
of representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.1_, _Section
3.2_,  _Section 3.4_, _Section 3.18_ and _Section 3.19_ and (ii) the
Ceiling Amount shall not apply to breaches of representations and warranties
contained in  _Section 3.4_; _provided,_ the Seller Parties aggregate
liability for a breach of such _Section 3.4_ shall not exceed the amount of
the Aggregate Consideration.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | To the extent the Seller Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification for Damages pursuant to _Section 9.2_, the Buyer
Parties shall be liable only for those Damages which exceed, in the
aggregate, the Deductible Amount, and then only to the extent of any such
excess. In no event shall the Buyer Parties aggregate liability to the
Seller Indemnified Parties under _Section 9.2_ exceed the Ceiling Amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible Amount shall not apply to
breaches of representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.1_, 
_Section 4.2_ and _Section 4.4_.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Additionally, neither the Buyer Parties, on the one
hand, nor the Seller Parties, on the other hand, will be liable as an
indemnitor under this Agreement for any consequential, incidental, special,
indirect or exemplary damages suffered or incurred by the indemnified party
or parties except to the extent resulting pursuant to Indemnity Claims.  
      
    | (d)  |   | The Parties agree that any indemnification or payment
obligation of the Seller Parties under _Section 9.1(i)_ (to the extent
relating to a breach of a representation or warranty in _Section 3.1(b)_ or
in _Sections 3.5_ through  _3.19_ ) or _Section 9.1(iii)_ relating to
Damages suffered or incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties, Four Corners
LLC or Four Corners LLCs assets, businesses or operations shall be  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | limited to the Seller Parties Ownership Percentage
of such indemnification or payment obligation.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     9.11  |   | _Sole Remedy_.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Should the Closing occur, no party shall have liability under
this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby except as is provided in _Article 7_ or this
_Article 9_ (other than claims or causes of action arising from fraud).  
   

  

ARTICLE 10

  10.2  |   | _Notices_.

  10.3  |   | _Governing Law_.  
      
    |   | This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance
with the substantive laws of the State of Texas without reference to
principles of conflicts of law.  
      
  10.4  |   | _Public Statements_.  
      
    |   | The Parties shall consult with each other and no party shall
issue any public announcement or statement with respect to this Agreement or

applicable law or stock exchange regulations.  
      
  10.5  |   | _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_.  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | This Agreement and the Ancillary Documents
constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof. Each party to this Agreement agrees that no other party to this
Agreement (including its agents and representatives) has made any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement to or with such party
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, other
than those expressly set forth herein and in the Ancillary Documents.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (b)  |   | No supplement, modification or waiver of this
Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by each party to be
bound thereby. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless
of whether similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver
unless otherwise expressly provided.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     10.6  |   | _Conflicting Provisions_.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | This Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents, read as a
whole, set forth the Parties rights, responsibilities and liabilities with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents, and as between them, specific provisions prevail
over general provisions. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents, this Agreement shall control.  
      
  10.7  |   | _Binding Effect and Assignment_.  
      
    |   | This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, but
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned or transferred, by operation of law or otherwise,
by any party hereto without the prior written consent of each other
party. Except as set forth in _Section 10.8_, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person or entity other
than the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
rights, benefits or obligations hereunder.  
      
  10.8  |   | _Severability_.  
      
    |   | If any provision of the Agreement is rendered or declared
illegal or unenforceable by reason of any existing or subsequently enacted
legislation or by decree of a court of last resort, the Buyer Parties and the
Seller Parties shall promptly meet and negotiate substitute provisions for
those rendered or declared illegal or unenforceable, but all of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect.  
      
  10.9  |   | _Interpretation_.  
      
    |   | It is expressly agreed by the Parties that neither this
Agreement nor any of the Ancillary Documents shall be construed against any
party, and no consideration shall be given or presumption made, on the basis
of who drafted this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or any provision hereof
or thereof or who supplied the form of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Documents. Each party agrees that this Agreement has been purposefully drawn
and correctly reflects its understanding of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and, therefore, waives the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     10.10  |   | _Headings and Disclosure Schedules_.

    |   | With respect to any action, notice, consent, approval or waiver
that is required to be taken or given or that may be taken or given by the
Buyer Parties prior to the Closing Date, such action, notice, consent,
approval or waiver shall be taken or given by the Conflicts Committee on

For the taxable year in which an Excess Payment is made, if not previously allocated, each holder of a Class B Unit shall be allocated items of gross income in an amount equal to the Excess Payment distributed to it as provided in Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A). For the avoidance of doubt, each Common Unit issued upon conversion of a Class B Unit shall be entitled to receive the full distribution payable to the holder of a Common Unit concurrently with the distribution of such Excess Payment. 

   

 (h) _Surrender of Certificates._ Upon receipt of the Conversion Approval in accordance with Section 5.11(f) or a change in rules of the National Securities Exchange as described in Section 5.11(i), the General Partner shall give the holders of the Class B Units prompt notice of such Conversion Approval or change in rules and, subject to the requirements of Section 6.7(d), each holder of Class B Units shall promptly surrender the Class B Unit Certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the General Partner or of any transfer agent for the Class B Units. In the case of any such conversion, the Partnership shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Class B Units one or more Common Unit Certificates, registered in the name of such holder, for the number of Common Units to which such holder shall be entitled. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made as of the Conversion Approval Date or, in the case of Section 5.11(i), the date of the effectiveness of such rule change (the " _Conversion Effective Date_ "), and the Person entitled to receive the Common Units issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such Common Units as of such date. 

   

 (i) _Change in Rules of National Securities Exchange_. If at any time (i) the rules of the National Securities Exchange on which the Common Units are listed or admitted to trading or the staff interpretations of such rules are changed or (ii) facts or circumstances arise so that no vote or consent of Unitholders is required as a condition to the listing or 

   ##### 

  

   

admission to trading of the Common Units that would be issued upon
any conversion of any Class B Units into Common Units as provided in
Section 5.11(f), the terms of such Class B Units will be changed so that each
Class B Unit is converted (without further action or any vote of any
Unitholders other than compliance with Section 5.11(h)) into one Common Unit
and immediately thereafter, none of the Class B Units shall be
Outstanding." 

  

 11. Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A) of the Partnership Agreement is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 

   

"(A) If the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of any
property distributed (except cash or property distributed or deemed
distributed pursuant to Section 5.5(a), with respect to Class B Units or
Privately Placed Common Units, or Section 12.4) to any Unitholder with
respect to its Units for a taxable year is greater (on a per Unit basis) than
the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of property distributed to the
other Unitholders with respect to their Units (on a per Unit basis), then (1)
each Unitholder receiving such greater cash or property distribution shall
be allocated gross income in an amount equal to the product of (aa) the
amount by which the distribution (on a per Unit basis) to such Unitholder
exceeds the distribution (on a per Unit basis) to the Unitholders receiving
the smallest distribution and (bb) the number of Units owned by the
Unitholder receiving the greater distribution; and (2) the General Partner
shall be allocated gross income in an aggregate amount equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (aa) the quotient determined by dividing (x) the
General Partners Percentage Interest at the time in which the greater cash
or property distribution occurs by (y) the sum of 100 less the
General Partners Percentage Interest at the time in which the greater cash
or property distribution occurs times (bb) the sum of the amounts allocated
in clause (1) above." 

  

 12. Article VI is hereby amended to add a new Section 6.1(d)(xiv) as follows: 

   

"(xiv) _Allocations for Class B Units and Privately Placed Common Units._ 

   

 (A) With respect to any taxable period of the Partnership ending upon, or after, a Book-Up Event or Book-Down Event occurring after the date of issuance of the Class B Units and the Privately Placed Common Units, Partnership items of income or gain for such taxable period shall be allocated 100% (1) to the Partners holding Privately Placed Common Units in proportion to the number of Privately Placed Common Units held by such Partners, until each such Partner has been allocated the amount that increases the Capital Account of such Privately Placed Common Unit to the Per Unit Capital Amount for an outstanding Common Unit (other than a Privately Placed Common Unit) and (2) to the Partners holding Class B Units or converted Class B Units that are Outstanding as of the 

   ##### 

  

    

time of such conversion in proportion to the number of Class B Units
or converted Class B Units held by such Partners, until each such Partner
has been allocated the amount that increases the Capital Account of such
Class B Unit or converted Class B Unit to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a
then outstanding Common Unit. 

   

 (B) With respect to any taxable period of the Partnership ending upon, or after, the transfer of Privately Placed Common Units or converted Class B Units to a Person that is not an Affiliate of the holder, Partnership items of income or gain for such taxable period shall be allocated 100% (1) to the Partners transferring such Privately Placed Common Units in proportion to the number of Privately Placed Common Units transferred by such Partners, until each such Partner has been allocated the amount that increases the Capital Account of such Privately Placed Common Unit to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then outstanding Common Unit (other than a Privately Placed Common Unit) and then (2) to the Partners transferring such converted Class B Units in proportion to the number of converted Class B Units transferred by such Partners, until each such Partner has been allocated the amount that increases the Capital Account of such converted Class B Unit to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then outstanding Common Unit." 

  

 12. Section 6.5 is hereby amended to add the following as a new penultimate sentence: 

   

"Available Cash that is deemed to be Capital Surplus shall then
be distributed (A) to the General Partner in accordance with its
Percentage Interest and (B) to all Unitholders holding Class B Units, Pro
Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the General Partners Percentage
Interest, until there has been distributed in respect of each Class B Unit
then Outstanding an amount equal to the Cumulative Class B Unit Arrearage." 

  

 13. Section 6.6(a) of the Partnership Agreement is hereby amended to amend and restate the first sentence thereof as follows: 

   

"The Minimum Quarterly Distribution, First Target Distribution, Second Target
Distribution, Third Target Distribution, Common Unit Arrearages, Cumulative
Common Unit Arrearages, Class B Unit Arrearages and Cumulative Class B Unit
Arrearages shall be proportionately adjusted in the event of any
distribution, combination or subdivision (whether effected by a distribution
payable in Units or otherwise) of Units or other Partnership Securities in
accordance with Section 5.9." 

  

 14. Article VI is hereby amended to add a new Section 6.7(d) as follows: 

   

"(d) A Unitholder holding (1) a Privately Placed Common Unit or (2) a Class B
Unit that has converted into a Common Unit pursuant to Section 

   ##### 

  

   

5.11 shall be required to provide notice to the General Partner of
the transfer of the Privately Placed Common Unit or converted Class B
Unit within the earlier of (i) 30 days following such transfer or (ii) the
last Business Day of the calendar year during which such transfer
occurred, unless (x) the transfer is to an Affiliate of the holder or (y) by
virtue of the application of Section 6.1(d)(xiv)(B) to a prior transfer of
the Unit or the application of Section 6.1(d)(xiv)(A), the General Partner
has previously determined, based on advice of counsel, that the Privately
Placed Common Unit or converted Class B Unit should have, as a substantive
matter, like intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of an
Initial Common Unit. In connection with the condition imposed by this
Section 6.7(d), the General Partner shall take whatever steps are required
to provide economic uniformity to the Privately Placed Common Units
and converted Class B Units in preparation for a transfer of such
Units, including the application of Section 6.1(d)(xiv)(B); _provided,
however_ , that no such steps may be taken that would have a material adverse
effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units represented by Common Unit
Certificates." 

  

 15. Except as hereby amended, the Partnership Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 

  

 16. This Amendment shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, all rights and remedies being governed by such laws without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. 

  

 17. Each provision of this Amendment shall be considered severable and if for any reason any provision or provisions herein are determined to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal under any existing or future law, such invalidity, unenforceability or illegality shall not impair the operation of or affect those portions of this Amendment that are valid, enforceable and legal.
