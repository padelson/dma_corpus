<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
(this &#147;Agreement&#148;) is entered into as of June 15,
2004 by and among MGM MIRAGE, a Delaware corporation (&#147;Parent&#148;), having an
address of 3600 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109, MANDALAY
RESORT GROUP, a Nevada corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), having an address of 3950
Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119, and MGM MIRAGE ACQUISITION
CO. #61, a Nevada corporation (&#147;Merger Subsidiary&#148;), having an address of 3600
Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109. Parent, the Company and,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have each
approved the merger of Merger Subsidiary with and into the Company on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the &#147;Merger&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">ARTICLE I



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>THE MERGER; CLOSING</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION
1.01. <u>The Merger</u>. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the NRS, Merger Subsidiary shall be
merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.02). Following the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
&#147;Surviving Corporation&#148;) and a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent, and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of
Merger Subsidiary in accordance with the NRS. The term &#147;NRS&#148; means Chapters
78, 92A and, if Merger Subsidiary is organized under Chapter&nbsp;86, Chapter&nbsp;86 of
the Nevada Revised Statutes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION
1.02. <u>Effective Time</u>. The Merger shall become effective when
Articles of Merger (the &#147;Articles of Merger&#148;), executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the NRS, are filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Nevada. When used in this Agreement, the term &#147;Effective Time&#148; shall
mean the date and time at which the Articles of Merger are accepted for record
or such later time established by the Articles of Merger. The filing of the
Articles of Merger shall be made on the date of the Closing (as defined in
Section&nbsp;1.07).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION
1.03. <u>Effects of the Merger</u>. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in Section&nbsp;92A.250 of the NRS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION
1.04. <u>Conversion of Shares</u>. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

value $.01-2/3 per share (together with the associated Rights (as defined in
Section&nbsp;4.02(b)), &#147;Company Common Stock&#148;) held by the Company as treasury
stock and each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock owned by
any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any
other subsidiary of Parent shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no payment or consideration shall be made with
respect thereto;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than
shares of Company Common Stock referred to in paragraph (a)&nbsp;above, shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to $71.00 (the &#147;Merger Consideration&#148;). At the Effective Time, all such shares
of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;each issued and outstanding share of capital stock or ownership
interest of Merger Subsidiary shall be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01-2/3, of the Surviving
Corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION
1.05. <u>Payment of Shares</u>. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to
act as disbursing agent (the &#147;Disbursing Agent&#148;) for the payment of Merger
Consideration upon surrender of certificates representing the shares of Company
Common Stock. Parent will enter into a disbursing agent agreement with the
Disbursing Agent, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Disbursing Agent in trust for the benefit of the Company&#146;s
stockholders cash in an aggregate amount necessary to make the payments
pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.04 to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (such
amounts being hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Exchange Fund&#148;). The Disbursing
Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund, as the Surviving Corporation directs, in
direct obligations of the United States of America, obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for
the payment of all principal and interest or commercial paper obligations
receiving the highest rating from either Moody&#146;s Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, or a combination
thereof, provided that, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a
maturity exceeding three months. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving
Corporation. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose except
as provided in this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Disbursing Agent to mail to each person who was a record holder as of
the Effective Time of an outstanding certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common
Stock (the &#147;Certificates&#148;), and whose shares were converted into the right to
receive Merger Consideration pursuant to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Section&nbsp;1.04, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Disbursing
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the
Disbursing Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal
duly executed and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Disbursing Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid promptly in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the product of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate multiplied by
the Merger Consideration, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates. If payment is to be made to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
payment pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the
provisions of this Section&nbsp;1.05, each Certificate (other than Certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock owned by any subsidiary of the
Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other subsidiary of Parent and shares
of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, which shall have
been canceled) shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash multiplied by the number of shares of Company
Common Stock evidenced by such Certificate, without any interest thereon.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable law. All cash
paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article&nbsp;I shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificates. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificates shall be cancelled and
exchanged for cash as provided in this Article&nbsp;I. At the close of business on
the day of the Effective Time the stock ledger of the Company shall be closed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;At any time more than six months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Disbursing Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Disbursing Agent
and not disbursed in exchange for Certificates (including all interest and
other income received by the Disbursing Agent in respect of all such funds).
Thereafter, holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall look only to Parent
(subject to the terms of this Agreement and abandoned property, escheat and
other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger
Consideration that may be payable, without interest, upon surrender

surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such time on which any payment in respect thereof would otherwise escheat or
become the property of any governmental unit or agency), the payment in respect
of such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation nor the
Disbursing Agent shall be liable to any holder of a share of Company Common
Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share of
Company Common Stock to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or other similar law.

1.06. <u>Stock Options; Restricted Stock</u><B>.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;At the Effective Time, each outstanding unexercised option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock (the &#147; Options&#148;) previously granted by the
Company or its subsidiaries, whether or not then vested or exercisable in
accordance with its terms, shall be canceled automatically and Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the holder thereof with a lump
sum cash payment equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii)&nbsp;the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Option, less withholding
taxes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;At the Effective Time, each vested or unvested restricted share of
Company Common Stock (&#147;Restricted Stock&#148;) shall be canceled in exchange for a
lump sum cash payment equal to $71.00.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION
1.07. <u>The Closing</u>. The closing of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the &#147;Closing&#148;) shall take place at the executive offices of
Parent in Las Vegas, Nevada, commencing at 9:00 a.m. local time on the second
business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the
obligations of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than conditions with respect to actions the respective parties will take
at the Closing itself) or such other place and date as the Parties may
mutually determine (the &#147;Closing Date&#148;).

herewith (the &#147;Parent Disclosure Schedule&#148;), it being agreed that disclosure of

reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. In this
Agreement, the term &#147;Company Material Adverse Effect&#148; means an effect (other
than an effect arising out of or resulting from (x)&nbsp;changes in or affecting the
travel, hospitality or gaming industries generally or in the states of Nevada,

to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has the requisite power and authority to own,
lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted and each subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified and
licensed to transact business, and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept), in each jurisdiction in which the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification necessary; except, in all cases, where
the failure to be so organized, existing, qualified, licensed and in good
standing or to have such power and authority would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of each subsidiary of the Company are validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. There are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls, contracts, commitments,
understandings, restrictions or arrangements relating to the issuance or sale

which more than 50% of the total voting power of shares of capital stock or
other equity interests entitled (without regard to the occurrence of any
