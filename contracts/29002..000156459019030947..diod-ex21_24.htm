Section 9.4Amendment or Supplement

 

. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented by the Parties by
action taken or authorized by written agreement of the Parties (by action
taken by their respective boards of directors, if required) at any time prior
to the Share Swap Record Date, whether before or after the Company Shareholder
Approval has been obtained; provided, however, that after the Company
Shareholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment shall become effective
that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the
Company Shareholders without such further approval or adoption. This
Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether
by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing
specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of
the Parties in interest at the time of the amendment.

 

Section 9.5Extension of Time; Waiver

 

. At any time prior to the Share Swap Record Date, the Parties may (by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, if required), to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or acts of the Company (in the case of
an extension by Buyer) or Buyer (in the case of an extension by the Company),
as applicable, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the Company (in the case of a waiver by Buyer) or Buyer (in the
case of a waiver by the Company), set forth in this Agreement or any document
delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions of the Company (in the case of a

herein; provided, however, that after the Company Shareholder Approval has
been obtained, no waiver may become effective that pursuant to applicable Law
requires further approval or adoption by the Company Shareholders without such
further approval or adoption. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any
such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed
and delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such Party, as
applicable. No failure or delay of any Party in exercising any right or
remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power.

 

Section 9.6No Rollover

 

. None of Diodes Incorporated or any of its Subsidiaries has entered or will
enter into any agreement with any director or major shareholder (as defined in
the Taiwan Securities and Exchange Act) of the Company that provides for a
shareholder rollover or similar arrangement in connection with the Share Swap.

 

Section 9.7Successors and Assigns

 

. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. This Agreement, and all of Buyer's rights, interests and

accordance with

   

Section 3.2; provided, that no such assignment or delegation shall relieve
Buyer of its obligations hereunder. Except as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, this Agreement may not be assigned, nor the rights or
obligations of any Party transferred or delegated to any other Person without
the prior written consent of the other Party.

 

Section 9.8Rights Cumulative

 

. Each and all of the various rights, powers and remedies of a Party will be
considered to be cumulative with and in addition to any other rights, powers
and remedies which such Party may have at law or in equity in the event of the
breach of any of the terms of this Agreement. The exercise or partial
exercise of any right, power or remedy will neither constitute the exclusive
election thereof nor the waiver of any other right, power or remedy available
to such Party.

 

Section 9.9Governing Law

 

. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity,
interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Taiwan,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or
provisions that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the Taiwan.

 

Section 9.10Dispute Resolution

 

.

 

    

(a)

 |  

Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any dispute, legal action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement (an "Arbitrable
Dispute") brought by any Party or its successors or assigns shall be brought
and determined to be settled by binding arbitration. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, nothing in this Section 9.10 shall prevent a Party from
seeking specific performance from a court of competent jurisdiction pending
settlement of any Arbitrable Dispute. 

---|--- 

 

    

(b)

 |  

Except as otherwise specifically stated herein, any Arbitrable Dispute shall
be resolved by arbitration in Taipei, Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan
Arbitration Act. The arbitration shall be conducted in English and by the
Chinese Arbitration Association, Taipei (the "CAA") in accordance with the
Arbitration Rules of the CAA. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the
arbitrator shall be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the subject
matter thereof, including, without limitation, the Taipei District Court. The
final decision of the arbitrators, as entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction, will be furnished by the arbitrators to the Parties in writing
and will constitute a final, conclusive and non-appealable determination of
the issue in question, binding upon the Parties, and an Order with respect
thereto may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, including,
without limitation, the Taipei District Court. 

---|--- 

 

    

(c)

 |  

Any such arbitration will be conducted before a panel of three (3)
arbitrators, each of whom will be compensated for his or her services at a
rate to be determined by the CAA. Each of the claimant and the respondent
shall appoint one (1) arbitrator, and the claimant and the respondent shall
jointly appoint the third arbitrator as the chief arbitrator. If the Parties
are unable to agree on the arbitrators within thirty (30) days following
submission of the dispute to CAA by one of the Parties, CAA will have the
authority to select the arbitrators from a list of arbitrators who satisfy the
criteria set forth in Section 9.10(d). 

---|--- 

 

    

(d)

 |  

No arbitrator shall have any past or present family, business or other
relationship with Buyer, the Company, or any Affiliate, Subsidiary, director
or officer thereof, unless following full disclosure of all such
relationships, Buyer and the Company agree in 

---|--- 

   

    |  

writing to waive such requirement with respect to an individual in connection
with any Arbitrable Dispute. 

---|--- 

 

    

(e)

 |  

The claimant shall advance the arbitration fees required by the CAA upon
demanding for arbitration; provided, however, that: (i) the prevailing Party
in any arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and costs;
and (ii) all fees and costs of arbitration will be paid by the losing Party,
unless other provided in the arbitral award. The arbitrator will be
authorized to determine the identity of the prevailing Party and the losing
Party. 

---|--- 

 

    

(f)

 |  

Except as specifically otherwise provided herein, arbitration will be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Parties for any Arbitrable Dispute. 

---|--- 

 

Section 9.11Expenses

 

. Except as may otherwise be agreed to hereunder or in other writing by the
Parties, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the
Share Swap and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne and
timely paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Share Swap is consummated.

 

Section 9.12Currency

 

. All references to "NT$" in this Agreement refer to New Taiwan Dollars.

 

Section 9.13Counterparts

 

. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, any one of which
need not contain the signature of more than one Party, but all such
counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 

Section 9.14Delivery by Electronic Transmission

 

. This Agreement and any signed agreement entered into in connection herewith
or contemplated hereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif,
.jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner
and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of a Party to any such contract, the
other Party shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to the
requesting Party. No Party to any such contract shall raise the use of a
facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine
or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail as a
defense to the formation of a contract and such Party forever waives any such
defense.

Company Disclosure Letter to the Share Swap Agreement

 



 



 

Reference is made to the Share Swap Agreement (the "Agreement") dated as of
August 8, 2019 by and between Diodes Incorporated, a company incorporated and
in existence under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA and having its
principal place of business at 4949 Hedgcoxe Rd., Suite 200, Plano, Texas, USA
("Buyer") and Lite-On Semiconductor Corp., a company incorporated and in
existence under the laws of Taiwan with uniform commercial number of 23528103
and having its registered address at 4F. No. 392, Ruiguang Rd., Neihu Dist.,
Taipei, Taiwan (the "Company").Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise
defined shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in the
Agreement.

 



 

The Company Disclosure Letter is being delivered by the Company pursuant to
the Agreement and qualifies the representations and warranties of the Company
by reference to specific provisions in Article IV of the Agreement. Each
exception set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter is identified by
reference to, or has been grouped under a heading referring to, a specific
individual section or subsection of the Agreement; provided, however, that the
inclusion of any item referenced in one section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to refer to any other section or subsection
of the Company Disclosure Letter, whether or not an explicit cross-reference
appears, if the applicability of such item to the other section or subsection
is reasonably apparent on its face without reference to underlying documents
therein. The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter
shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of the materiality of such
item, nor shall it establish a standard of materiality for any purpose
whatsoever. Matters reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter are not
necessarily limited to matters required by the Agreement to be disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Letter. Neither the specification of any dollar amount
in the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter is intended to
imply that such amounts, higher or lower amounts, the items so included, or
other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the
Company Disclosure Letter in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as
to whether any obligation, item or matter is or is not material, or may
constitute an event or condition which could be considered to have a Material
Adverse Effect.
