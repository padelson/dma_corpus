 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I

the Closing by facsimile or other electronic transmission. All deliveries by
one party to any other party at the Closing shall be deemed to have occurred
simultaneously and none shall be effective until and unless all have occurred,
unless the parties agree otherwise in writing.

  

 Section 1.3. _ Effective Time._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Company and Parent will cause the Certificate of Merger to be duly executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall take all such reasonable further actions as may be required by Law to make the Merger effective. The Merger shall become effective on the Closing Date at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date and time as Parent and the Company may agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 Section 1.4. _ Conversion of the Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

  

 (a) Except as provided in _Section 1.4(b)_ or _Section 1.9(h)_, each share of Company Common Stock (all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive, in cash without interest and subject to any required withholding of Taxes, an amount equal to $32.00 (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") upon surrender of the Certificate representing such Shares as provided in _Section 1.9_. All Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate representing Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which such Shares have been converted, as provided herein. 

  

 (b) Each Share that is owned by the Company as treasury stock or otherwise or by any Subsidiary of the Company and each Share owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

  

 Section 1.5. _ Organizational Documents_. 

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, pursuant to the Merger, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read in its entirety the same as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the corporate name of the Surviving Corporation remains "True Religion Apparel, Inc.". Thereafter, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation may be amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by Law. 

  

      

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, pursuant to the Merger, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read in their entirety the same as the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the corporate name of the Surviving Corporation remains "True Religion Apparel, Inc.". Thereafter, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation may be amended in accordance with their terms and the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by Law. 

  

  

 Section 1.6. _ Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation._ The Company shall cause to be delivered to Parent, prior to the Closing, resignations of all the directors of the Company, unless otherwise specified in writing by Parent, to be effective at the Effective Time. Immediately following the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of the Company shall continue in office as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, and such directors and officers shall hold office until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with and subject to applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.7. _ Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each Share subject to restrictions on transfer and/or forfeiture issued by the Company under the Company Incentive Plans, including those Shares subject to performance-based conditions (" _Company Restricted Shares_ "), shall become or otherwise be deemed fully vested effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. Except as may be otherwise agreed in writing between Parent and an individual holder of Company Restricted Shares, at the Effective Time, each vested, issued and outstanding Company Restricted Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.4(a) _hereof, less required withholding Taxes in accordance with _Section 1.9(g)_. 

   

 Section 1.8. _ Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares issued and outstanding on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_ that this _Section 1.8 _shall not affect or supersede the provisions of _Section 4.1_. 

  

 Section 1.9. _ Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

  

 (a) _ Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent to act as paying agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates pursuant to this _Section 1.9_ and payment of the other amounts payable pursuant to this _Article I_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash in the aggregate amount required to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares (including Company Restricted Shares pursuant to _Section 1.7_), and the Company shall cooperate with Parent in depositing cash with the Paying Agent substantially simultaneously, as needed (such cash amounts being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be used solely for purposes of paying the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares (including Company Restricted Shares) in accordance with this _Section 1.9_ and shall not be used to satisfy any other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Pending distribution of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this _Section 1.9_, Parent may direct the Paying Agent to invest such cash, _provided_ that such investments are Permitted Investments and shall have maturities that will not prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this _Section 1.9_. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable solely to Parent. If the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the amount required to make prompt payment of the Merger Consideration, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or restore the lost portion of the Exchange Fund to ensure that it is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. 

  

      

  

 (b) _ Exchange Procedures_. 

    

 (i) As soon as practicable (but not more than three (3) days) after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (or evidence of shares in book entry form), that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") that were subsequently converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in _Section 1.4_: (A) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") that (1) shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof, together with any bond or indemnity agreement, as contemplated by _Section 1.9(f)_) and (2) shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify (including customary instructions with respect to the delivery of Shares held in book entry form); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration. 

  

 (ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and any other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, (A) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check representing the applicable amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration for each Share represented by such Certificate and (B) the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.9(b)_, each such Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration. 

  

 (iii) In the event of a valid transfer of ownership of Shares prior to the Effective Time that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration may be paid to the applicable transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all customary documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable Taxes have been paid. 

    

 (c) _ No Further Ownership Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of the Certificates representing Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Section 1.9 _shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares and, after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Section 1.9_. 

  

 (d) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the former Company Stockholders on the date twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holder of Shares who has not theretofore received any applicable Merger Consideration to which such holder of Shares is entitled under this _Section 1.9_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration without any interest thereon and only as a general creditor thereof. 

  

      

  

 (e) _ No Liability._ None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Merger Sub shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any part of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Shares at such date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law or Order, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (f) _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, or the execution and delivery by such Person of an indemnity agreement in such form as the Surviving Corporation may direct, in each case as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (g) _ Withholding of Taxes._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law (including any income Tax Law or other Tax Law). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be (i) paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law or Order and (ii) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

   

 (h) _ Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are owned by a Company Stockholder who has perfected and not withdrawn a demand for dissenters\' rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn (in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) or lost such Person\'s right to payment of fair value under the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares. Instead, unless and until a Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively so withdrawn or lost such Dissenting Stockholder\'s right to appraisal under the DGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to those rights granted by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to Company Stockholders\' dissenters\' rights and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

associated with the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent and Merger Sub have fully
paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by the
Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date hereof. As of the date
hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto, under the
Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letters will not be satisfied or that sufficient funds to fund the Exchange
Fund and to pay all Expenses and all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions pursuant to their payment
obligation hereunder will not be made available to Parent and Merger Sub on
the Closing Date; _provided_ that Parent is not making any representation
regarding the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in

satisfied (and remain satisfied), as of the date hereof, the net proceeds
contemplated by the Commitment Letters will, together with Company cash, in
the aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to

 (b) _ Permitted Response to Unsolicited Takeover Proposals._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 4.2_ or any other provision of this Agreement, if at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Company\'s receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the 

  

      

  

Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide, written Takeover Proposal from a
third party that did not result from a breach of this _Section 4.2_, and

Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, then the Company shall be permitted to (A) furnish
information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the
Company shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to such Person
provide to Parent a copy of the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and any
non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries to which
any Person is provided such access and which was not previously provided to
Parent, and (y) the Company shall withhold such portions of documents or
information, or provide pursuant to customary "clean-room" or
other appropriate procedures, to the extent relating to any pricing or other
matters that are highly sensitive or competitive in nature if the exchange of
such information (or portions thereof) could, in the sole discretion of the
Company, reasonably be likely to be harmful to the operation of the Company in
any material respect) and (B) engage in discussions and negotiations with the
Person making such Takeover Proposal regarding such Takeover Proposal.

  

 (c) _ Notice to Parent of Takeover Proposals._ If the Company or any of its Representatives receives any Takeover Proposal (including any material changes to a Takeover Proposal) then the Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) after becoming aware thereof, notify Parent (orally and in writing), and in connection with such notice, provide the identity of the Person or group making such Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof (including, if applicable, copies of any written proposals, indications of interest or offers, including proposed agreements), and thereafter the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, as to the status thereof (including any material changes to the terms thereof, and any change to the price, and any other material developments with respect to), including by promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) providing to Parent copies of any additional or revised written proposals, indications of interest, offers, or proposed agreements relating to such Takeover Proposal.

 (e) _ Change in Recommendation._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Company\'s receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a Change in Recommendation only if (i) the Company has received an unsolicited, bona fide, written Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 4.2_ and the Company Board determines in good faith, After Consultation, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, After Consultation, that in the light of an Intervening Event, the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of the Company Board\'s fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company Board shall not be permitted to make a Change in Recommendation or, solely with respect to a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)(i)_ unless theretofore (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent and Merger Sub no fewer than four (4) Business Days\' advance written notice of the Company\'s intention to make a Change in Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)(i)_ (a " _Notice of Intended Recommendation Change_ ") and (y): 

    

 (i) if such Change in Recommendation is being made in respect of an Intervening Event: 

    

 (1) the Notice of Intended Recommendation Change shall include a reasonable description of the Intervening Event that serves as the basis of such Change in Recommendation; 

  

 (2) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for making such Change in Recommendation; or 

    

 (ii) if such Change in Recommendation or termination is being made in respect of a Superior Proposal: 

    

 (1) the Notice of Intended Recommendation Change shall specify the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof and attach copies of all relevant documents relating to such Superior Proposal, including the financing commitments relating thereto (it being hereby understood and agreed that any material amendment to the terms of any such Superior Proposal (including any amendment to any price term thereof), shall require a new Notice of Intended Recommendation Change and again require compliance with the requirements of this _Section 4.2(e) _, except that the advance written notice period and corresponding references in clause (x) of this _Section 4.2(e)_ to four (4) Business Days shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days for any such new Notice of Intended Recommendation Change); and 

  

 (2) after providing the Notice of Intended Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub have notified the Company of their intention to negotiate) during such four (4) Business Day period (or two (2) Business Day period in the case of a new Notice of Intended Recommendation Change) to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby; and 

    

 (iii) in the case of each of the immediately preceding clause (i) or clause (ii) of this _Section 4.2(e)_, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith, After Consultation, any amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including any increase in the Merger Consideration) and the other agreements contemplated hereby that may be offered in writing by Parent no later than 5:00 p.m., New York, New York time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day of such four (4) Business Day period (or the second (2nd) Business Day of such 

   

      

   

two (2) Business Day period for any such new Notice of Intended
Recommendation Change) and shall have determined (A) in the case of a Superior
Proposal, that the Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such amendments were to be given effect or
(B) in the case of a Change in Recommendation being made in respect of an
Intervening Event, that failure to make a Change in Recommendation would
nevertheless be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of the Company
Board\'s fiduciary duties under applicable Law if such amendments were to be
given effect.

    

 (f) _ Standstills; Confidentiality Agreements_. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not grant a waiver or release under any standstill agreement in effect on the date hereof or amend, modify or grant permission under any provision thereof; _provided_ that the Company shall be permitted to grant a waiver or release under any standstill agreement in effect on the date hereof solely to the extent necessary to permit the Person subject to such standstill agreement to make and engage in discussions with respect to, and negotiate, a Takeover Proposal that is conditioned on entering into mutually satisfactory definitive documentation with the Company in response to an unsolicited, bona fide request from such Person, but only if the Company Board determines in good faith, After Consultation, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of the Company Board\'s fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company shall provide written notice to Parent of the waiver or release of any standstill by the Company promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) following such waiver or release, which notice, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the identity of the Person or group receiving the waiver or release. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, enter into any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing to Parent the information specifically required to be provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 4.2_. 

  

 (g) _ Communications With Stockholders._ Nothing contained in this _Section 4.2_ shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Item 1012 of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders that the Company Board determines in good faith, After Consultation, is required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 4.2(g)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to make a Change in Recommendation except to the extent permitted by _Section 4.2(e),_ and that any such position or disclosure in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, in each case that includes a reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation.

 (c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other party informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by such party from, or any filing by such party with or material communication given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions (including, in the case of written correspondence or filings, by promptly providing the other parties (or their counsel) copies thereof), and (iii) consult with each other in advance of and be permitted to attend any meeting or conference (including teleconference) with such Governmental Authorities (to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authorities; _provided_ that such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such permission).

Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section 4.3_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

disposition of, or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise) such of its assets, properties or businesses or of the assets,
properties or business to be acquired pursuant hereto as are required to be
divested in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
Order in any Action, which would otherwise have the effect of materially
delaying or preventing the consummation of the Transactions, including the
Merger, or that would make the consummation of the Merger in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement unlawful.

  

 (e) The parties shall cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with the efforts to obtain any approval, consent, waiver or other confirmation from a third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than any Governmental Authority) with respect to the Transactions, without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' Representatives, shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to such Person.

The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and to satisfy all rules of NASDAQ. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub upon the receipt of any comments, whether written or oral, from the SEC or the staff of the SEC, or any request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide Parent and Merger Sub with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall consult with Parent and its counsel prior to submitting to the SEC or the staff of the SEC any response to any such comments. Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Shares, or submitting to the SEC or the staff of the SEC any response to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such documents and responses, and the Company will consider, in good faith, incorporating any such comments of Parent and/or its counsel prior to such filing, dissemination or submission. 

  

      

                                     

   

  

 (b) Parent shall provide to the Company in writing all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and resolution of comments of the SEC or its staff related thereto. Parent will cause the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub supplied by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Stockholders\' Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. Parent will furnish to the Company in writing the information relating to it and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Proxy Statement promptly following written request therefor from the Company. 

  

 (c) As promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date, the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law, its constituent documents and the rules of NASDAQ (i) establish a record date for and give notice of a meeting of Company Stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the approval of this Agreement (the " _Stockholders\' Meeting_ "), and (ii) mail to the holders of Shares as of the record date established for the Stockholders\' Meeting a Proxy Statement (the date the Company elects to take such action or is required to take such action, the " _Proxy Date_ "). The Company shall duly call, convene and hold the Stockholders\' Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall such meeting be held later than thirty-five (35) days following the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Company Stockholders other than in the case in which the Company is required to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the SEC or its staff or a court of competent jurisdiction has instructed the Company is necessary under applicable Law or Order and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the holders of Shares prior to the Stockholders\' Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company (A) shall adjourn or postpone the Stockholders\' Meeting if as of the time for which the Stockholders\' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders\' Meeting or insufficient proxies returned to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, and Parent requests such an adjournment or postponement, and (B) may otherwise only adjourn or postpone the Stockholders\' Meeting after consultation with Parent, and with Parent\'s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company Stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Stockholders\' Meeting. Once the Company has established a record date for the Stockholders\' Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date for the Stockholders\' Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law or the Company Charter Documents. The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Stockholders\' Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws (including all applicable rules of NASDAQ) and, unless the Company Board shall have made a Change in Recommendation in accordance with _Section 4.2(e)_, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from the holders of Shares for the adoption of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall (x) submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares as promptly as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the Company 

  

      

  

Stockholder Approval at the Stockholders\' Meeting and (y) not submit any
Takeover Proposal for approval by the shareholders of the Company. The Company
shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent in writing at
least on a daily basis on each of the last ten (10) Business Days prior to the
date of the Stockholders\' Meeting as to the aggregate tally of
proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company Stockholder
Approval.

  

 (d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective officers or directors is known by the Company which, pursuant to the Securities Act or Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly inform Parent. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading. 

   

 (e) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall affirmatively vote at the Stockholders\' Meeting or otherwise all Shares beneficially owned by it or any of its respective Subsidiaries as of the applicable record date, for the approval of this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law. Parent shall vote all of the shares of capital stock of Merger Sub beneficially owned by it, or sign a written consent in lieu of a meeting of the stockholders of Merger Sub, in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law. 

  

  

 Section 4.5. _ Public Announcements._ The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except for a Change in Recommendation permitted pursuant to _Section 4.2(e)_ or any communication contemplated by _Section 4.2(g)_, neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with, or applicable rules of, a national securities exchange or NASDAQ as determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party to comment on such press release or public announcement in advance of such issuance or publication). 

  

 Section 4.6. _ Access to Information; Confidentiality._ 

  

  

 (a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parent\'s Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, to the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities and to the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' books and records and furnish Parent and its Representatives with such financial and operating data and other information with respect to the business, personnel, properties and Contracts of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent and Merger Sub may from time to time reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Company shall not be required to afford such access if it would cause a violation of any Material Contract, would cause a loss of attorney/client privilege or trade secret protection to the Company or the Company\'s Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable Laws, provided that the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to make such disclosure in a form or manner that would not jeopardize such privilege or protection or violate such Law or contractual restriction (including by redacting or otherwise not disclosing any portion thereof the disclosure of which would jeopardize such privilege or entering into a joint defense agreement) and (y) any such investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or 

  

      

  

otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely
discharge by such officers of their normal duties. The information provided
will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
January 14, 2013, between TowerBrook Capital Partners, L.P. and the Company
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), provided that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be deemed to permit the disclosure of information in
connection with the Financing and otherwise in furtherance of satisfying the
conditions set forth in _Article V_ and completing the Merger.
Additionally, following the end of each applicable period until the earlier
to occur of the Effective Time and the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 6.1_, the Company shall promptly prepare and provide
to Parent the following: a monthly management report, a monthly international
management report, a monthly wholesale order book report, a monthly wholesale
sales and gross margin summary and a weekly retail sales and gross margin
reports broken down by channel (full price, outlet and e-commerce).

  

 (b) The Company shall provide consultants representing Parent (the " _Consultants_ "), to the fullest extent permitted by Law, reasonable access to the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities and books and records, including financial and operating data, during all business and operating hours, and with space to work at the Company\'s headquarters if requested by Parent to the extent available, and shall use reasonable efforts to assist the Consultants in familiarizing themselves with, and monitoring, the business and operations of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the Consultants shall have no executive authority with respect to, or decision making role at, the Company, but will be permitted to monitor, observe and discuss Company matters with access comparable to Company executives of senior rank. 

  

 (c) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this _Section 4.6,_ including by the Consultants, will modify any of the representations and warranties of the Company. 

  

  

 Section 4.7. _ Notification of Certain Matters._ The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such party\'s knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would (A) in the case of the Company, cause the conditions set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_, _Section 5.2(b)_ or _Section 5.2(c)_ not to be satisfied and (B) in the case of Parent, cause the conditions set forth in _Section 5.3(a)_ or _Section 5.3(b)_ not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 4.7_ shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice. 

  

 Section 4.8. _ Indemnification and Insurance._ 

  

  

 (a) From the Effective Time, the Company (and following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines, penalties and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys\' fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), to which such Indemnitee is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved by reason of the fact that such Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or, while a director or officer of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, such Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, as a director, officer, 

  

      

  

employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
(including with respect to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution,
announcement, performance and consummation of all Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and all acts or omissions of each Indemnitee leading thereto
and in furtherance thereof on behalf of the Company and holders of Shares),
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such
Action, (A) each Indemnitee will be entitled to advancement of expenses
incurred in the defense of any such Action from the Surviving Corporation
within ten (10) calendar days of receipt by the Surviving Corporation from
the Indemnitee of a written request therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
if required by the DGCL or the Company Charter Documents, any Indemnitee to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to the DGCL, (B) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to
assume the defense of any such matter with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
such Indemnitee, with such Indemnitee\'s approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, (C) if the Surviving Corporation assumes the defense of any such
matter, the Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any proceeding or threatened Action (and in
which indemnification or advancements could be sought by such Indemnitee
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of
such Action or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing and (D)
notwithstanding the foregoing, if such Indemnitee reasonably concludes that a
conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest exists between
Indemnitee and the Surviving Corporation or between Indemnitee and another
Indemnitee who is defended by the Company with the same counsel as counsel
representing Indemnitee, or if the Surviving Corporation fails to assume the
defense of such proceeding, such Indemnitee may retain one (1)
independent legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to Surviving Corporation,
and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnitee promptly after statements therefor are
received. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Indemnitee_ " means each
individual who is or was a director or officer of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company. Parent and the Company agree that all rights
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now
existing in favor of any Indemnitee as provided in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any indemnification or other agreements of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement
shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further
action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the respective certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational or governing documents of the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation\'s Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of Indemnitees for the period prior to and including the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Charter Documents and the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, or similar organizational and governing documents of the Company\'s Subsidiaries, respectively. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, the covenants contained in this _Section 4.8_. 

  

 (c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain and extend all existing officers\' and directors\' liability insurance of the Company (" _D andO Insurance_") for a period of not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from acts, omissions, facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in connection 

  

      

  

with the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may substitute (or cause the Surviving Corporation to
substitute) therefor policies of substantially equivalent coverage and amounts
containing terms no less favorable to the Indemnitees than the existing
DandO Insurance (so long as such policies are provided by the Company\'s
current insurance carrier or by a carrier with a rating no lower than A.M.
Best rating of A); and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the existing DandO
Insurance expires or is terminated or canceled during such period through no
fault of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain and maintain substantially similar
DandO Insurance (with such replacement policies to be provided by the
Company\'s current insurance carrier or by a carrier with a rating no lower
than A.M. Best rating of A). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
Parent be required to pay aggregate premiums for insurance under this _Section
4.8(c)_ in excess of 250% of the most recent aggregate annual premiums paid
by the Company for such purpose (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), the true and
correct amount of which is set forth in _Section 4.8(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the amount of insurance required by
this  _Section 4.8(c)_ for such aggregate premium, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain as much insurance as can be
obtained for aggregate premiums not in excess of the Maximum Amount. At the
Company\'s option, it may elect to obtain prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies
prior to the Effective Time covering a period of six (6) years from and after
the Effective Time with respect to acts, omissions, facts or events occurring
on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the premium therefor does
not exceed the Maximum Amount. Any such "tail" or "runoff" policy purchased
by the Company, Purchaser or the Surviving Company shall be in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation in the first
sentence of this _Section 4.8(c)_ for so long as any such tail or runoff
policy remains in full force and effect. In the event the Company purchases a
"tail" or "runoff" policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall use their reasonable best efforts to maintain
such tail or runoff policy in full force and effect for its term.

  

 (d) The rights of each Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnitee may have under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational or governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, any indemnification or other agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the DGCL or otherwise. Subsequent amendment of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational or governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries or any indemnification or other agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall not diminish or impair the rights of any Indemnitee thereunder or hereunder. 

  

 (e) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set forth in this _Section 4.8_. In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 4.8_. 

  

 (f) The provisions of this _Section 4.8_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger. Each Indemnitee (and his or her respective representatives, executors, administrators, spouse, estate, successors and heirs) are intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 4.8_, and this _Section 4.8_ shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnitee (including his or her 

  

      

  

respective representatives, executors, administrators, spouse, estate,
successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of such Indemnitee
(including his or her respective representatives, executors, administrators,
spouse, estate, successors and heirs) affected thereby.

  

  

 Section 4.9. _ Securityholder Litigation._ The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to the Transactions in accordance with the terms of a mutually agreed upon joint defense agreement. The Company may not enter into any settlement agreement in respect of any securityholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to the Transactions without Parent\'s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

 Section 4.10. _ Fees and Expenses._ Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated. Other than any Taxes imposed upon a holder of Shares (including Company Restricted Shares), the Company shall pay all Taxes incident to preparing for, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions (including (a) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees and (b) sales, use, gains, real property transfer and other or similar Taxes or fees). 

  

 Section 4.11. _ Rule 16b-3._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and, assuming that the Company delivers to Parent all requisite information, Parent shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters. 

  

 Section 4.12. _ Employee Benefits._ 

  

  

 (a) The Surviving Corporation shall provide or cause to be provided to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue as employees of the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (a " _Continuing Employee_ "), for a period extending until the earlier of the termination of such Continuing Employee\'s employment with such entities or twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (i) a base wage or salary at a rate not less than the rate of such base wage or salary in effect at the Effective Time and (ii) 401(k) benefits, severance benefit eligibility, medical benefits and other welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements that, as determined in Parent\'s good faith and reasonable discretion, (A) are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided under the Company Plans as in effect at the Effective Time; (B) are substantially comparable to those provided to employees of the Parent or its Subsidiaries, in the aggregate, from time to time; or (C) constitute any combination of the foregoing. With respect to each Continuing Employee whose employment with the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries continues through December 31, 2013 and who earns an annual bonus based on actual performance for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2013 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Plan, the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to such Continuing Employee such bonus at such time and subject to such conditions as is consistent with the past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The provisions of this _Section 4.12_ shall not be construed or interpreted to restrict in any way the Surviving Corporation\'s or Parent\'s ability to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan (including to change the entities who administer such Company Plans, or the manner in which such Company Plans are administered) to the extent not inconsistent with such foregoing restrictions or any other plan made available to the Continuing Employees or to terminate any Person\'s employment at any time or for any reason. 

  

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall (i) use reasonable efforts to ensure that any applicable pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage 

  

      

  

requirements in any replacement or successor welfare benefit plan of the
Surviving Corporation that a Continuing Employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is eligible to participate in immediately following the
Effective Time are waived to the extent such exclusions or waiting periods
were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by, such employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time under the relevant Company Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated, (ii) provide each such Continuing Employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductible paid prior to the Effective
Time (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company
Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible
or out-of-pocket requirements and (iii) to the extent that any Continuing
Employee is allowed to participate in any employee benefit plan of the Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time, cause such plan to recognize the service of such Continuing
Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit
accrual under any defined benefit, retiree welfare or any other plan) to the
same extent such service was recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries
under any similar Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not apply to the extent it would result in any duplication of benefits for
the same period of service. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or other relevant Subsidiaries to, credit to
Continuing Employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had
accrued under the paid-time off program, set forth in good faith in the
Company\'s payroll system, as of the Effective Time (to the extent that Parent
is not required by applicable Law to pay out such paid time off); _provided_
, _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not
obligate Parent, Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiaries to continue
such paid-time off program beyond the last day of the calendar year in which
the Closing Date occurs.

  

 (c) With respect to matters described in this _Section 4.12_, the Company shall consult with Parent (and consider in good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending any written notices or other communication materials (including any postings to any website) to its employees or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and shall not without the consent of Parent send any communication that shall affect the rights of employees or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with reasonable access to such employees or former employees for purposes of Parent providing notices or other communication materials regarding Parent compensation and benefit plans and the matters described in this _Section 4.12_; _provided_ that such notices or other communication materials are approved in advance by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 (d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, (i) provide any and all notices to, (ii) make any and all filings or registrations with, and (iii) obtain any and all consents or approvals of, any labor organization, works council or any similar entity, council or organization, required to be made or obtained in connection with this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions. 

  

 (e) Without limiting the generality of _Section 7.6_, nothing contained in this _Section 4.12_ shall create any third-party beneficiary right in any Person, or any right to employment or continued employment. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to amend or modify any compensation or benefit plan, policy, agreement or arrangement sponsored or maintained by Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates. 

  

  

 Section 4.13. _ Financing._ 

  

  

 (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters with respect to the 

  

      

  

conditionality, timing, availability, and aggregate amount of the Financing
(including the amounts to be funded thereunder at the Closing), including
using reasonable best efforts, subject to the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.8(a)_, to seek to enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters
in the event of a breach thereof by the Financing provider(s) thereunder.
Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall permit any amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Equity Commitment
Letter (other than to increase the amount of the Equity Financing) without
the Company\'s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall permit
any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter without the Company\'s prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) if such amendment, modification or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing, (ii) impairs in any material respect the
availability of the Debt Financing, (iii) amends the conditions precedent to
the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay in
any material respect or prevent the Closing, or (iv) adversely impacts in any
material respect the ability of any party hereto to enforce or cause the
enforcement of the rights of Parent or Merger Sub under any of the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements relating thereto or imposes
additional material obligations on the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
respective Affiliates prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent and Merger Sub may amend or restate the Debt Commitment Letter to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities as parties thereto who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as
of the date hereof, and may otherwise amend, modify or restate the Debt
Commitment Letter in any manner not inconsistent with this sentence. Parent
shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment,
modification or waiver. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable
best efforts (i) to maintain in effect the Commitment Letters until the
funding of the Financing at or prior to Closing and to negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (or on terms no
less favorable (taken as a whole) to Parent), (ii) to satisfy on a timely
basis (taking into account the expected timing of the commencement of the
Marketing Period) all conditions applicable to it in such definitive
agreements that are within its control, (iii) upon satisfaction of such
conditions (without waiver thereof not consented to by Parent), to consummate
the Financing at the Closing (with respect to amounts required to consummate
the Merger and make other payments due at such time in accordance with the
terms hereof) and (iv) to comply in all material respects with its obligations
under the Commitment Letters.

The Confidentiality Agreement shall (i) survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate as of the Effective Time.

Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. 

  

 Section 7.4. _ Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any 

        

of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, except

To the fullest extent permitted by Law, each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to assert (i) any objection which it may ever have to the laying of venue of any such action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), (ii) any claim that any such action brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, and (iii) any claim that such court does not have jurisdiction with respect to such action. 

  

      

                                    

  

  

 (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, except as provided in the following sentence. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VI_, the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement from the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), without proof of actual damages, without bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall only be entitled to seek or obtain an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies enforcing Parent\'s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or otherwise to effect the Merger or the Closing on the terms and conditions set forth herein (but not the right of the Company to such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for obligations other than with respect to the Equity Financing and the Closing) if (a) the Marketing Period has expired and the conditions to closing set forth in _Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing but that are expected to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied (and remain satisfied) or waived, (b) the full proceeds to be provided to Parent by the Debt Financing (or the Alternative Debt Financing) have been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (c) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that it stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger without further delay or 

  

      

  

condition, and if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded then it
will take such actions that are required by it under this Agreement to cause
the Closing to occur. The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking
the remedies provided for in this _Section 7.8_, a party shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to a party under this Agreement (including monetary damages) in the
event that the remedies provided for in this _Section 7.8_ are not available
or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section
7.8_ shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit
any party\'s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance
under this _Section 7.8_ prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article VI_ (and pursuing damages after
such termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding
pursuant to this _Section 7.8_ or anything set forth in this _Section 7.8_
restrict or limit any party\'s right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of _Article VI_ or pursue any other remedies under
this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub for monetary damages or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Transactions shall be limited to $58,439,000 plus the amount of any reimbursement of the Company\'s expenses pursuant to _Section 4.14(c)_ (subject to the cap set forth therein). In no event shall the Company seek or permit to be sought on behalf of the Company any damages or any other recovery, judgment or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, from any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub, or any Representative, member, controlling Person or holder of any equity interests or securities of Parent, Merger Sub, the Financing Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, other than against the Guarantors pursuant to the Guaranty. The Company acknowledges and agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, in each case with respect to damages, any Person (other than Parent to the extent provided in this Agreement or the Guarantors to the extent provided in the Guaranty), whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of the Company against Parent or Merger Sub or any respective Affiliate thereof, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise.
