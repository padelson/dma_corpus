Corporation directly or indirectly shall not be voted directly or indirectly; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to vote any shares of the Corporation&#146;s stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity

of votes to which each share is entitled. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section 8. <U>Organization of Meeting</U>. The Chairman of the Board, if any, shall preside at

applicable law or the rules and regulations of any national securities exchange, national securities association or interdealer quotation system upon which the Corporation&#146;s securities may be listed, the person presiding at a meeting of
stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including, without limitation, the regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of any discussion, as he or she believes to be in order. The Secretary of the
