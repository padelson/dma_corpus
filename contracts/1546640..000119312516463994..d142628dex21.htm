EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

 

OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Common Stock (as defined below)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such
share, a " _Share_ ") (other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or
any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent immediately
prior to the Effective Time and Shares owned by the Company, including Shares
held in treasury by the Company or owned by any direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of
third parties (collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") and (ii) the
Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) shall be converted automatically into
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $42.00 per Share in cash,
without interest and subject to any applicable withholding Taxes as provided
in _Section 2.3(e)_ (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), upon the
surrender of any non-certificated shares represented by a book-entry (each,
a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") in the manner provided in this _Article II_. At
the Effective Time, all of the Shares that have been converted into a right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (other than Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares) as provided in this _Section 2.1(a)_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall be cancelled and extinguished automatically and shall
cease to exist. Each former holder of a Book-Entry Share that was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with
respect to such Share, except for the right to receive the Per Share Merger

 



-3-  Consideration, without interest and subject to applicable withholding Taxes,
to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with this  _Article II_. Any Per Share Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender of any Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Book-Entry Share
and the respective non-certificated Share formerly represented thereby. As
provided in _Section 2.3(e)_, the right of any holder of a Share to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the
amount of any required withholding under applicable tax Law.

(b) _Cancellation of Cancelled Shares_. Each Cancelled Share shall cease to
be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor
and shall cease to exist.

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Options, Stock Units and PSUs_. Unless otherwise
mutually agreed in writing by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective
Time:

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding option to purchase Shares (an " _Option_ ") under the Company
Stock Plan, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, become immediately vested and be cancelled and shall
only entitle the holder of such Option to receive (without interest), an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject
to the Option, _multiplied_ by (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Option, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment, payable
(without any crediting of interest for the period from the Effective Time
through the date of payment) in a lump sum through the Companys payroll
system or by check or other method as determined by Parent as soon as
reasonably practicable (but no later than the second payroll date) after the
Effective Time.

(b) _Treatment of Stock Units_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, any
vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding restricted stock unit,
deferred stock unit, phantom stock unit or similar stock right (any such
arrangement, other than a PSU, a " _Stock Unit_ ") under the Company Stock
Plan shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, accelerate in full, and each Stock Unit shall be cancelled and
shall only entitle the holder of such Stock Unit to receive (without interest)
at or promptly following the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such Stock Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied_ by (y) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment, payable (without any crediting of interest for the
period from the Effective Time through the date of payment) in a lump sum
through the Companys payroll system or by check or other method as determined
by Parent as soon as reasonably practicable (but not later than the second
payroll date) after the Effective Time.

 



-4- (c) _Treatment of Performance Share Units_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding performance share unit (" _PSU_ ") under the Company
Stock Plan shall automatically and without any required action on the part of
the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such PSU
to receive (without interest), subject to the terms and conditions of this
_Section 2.2(c)_, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total
number of Shares subject to such PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
(assuming for this purpose that performance resulted in a payout of 115% of
the target award) _multiplied_ by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment, payable
(without any crediting of interest for the period from the Effective Time
through the date of payment) in a lump sum through the Companys payroll
system or by check or other method as determined by Parent as soon as
reasonably practicable (but not later than the second payroll date) after the
date that such PSU would have otherwise vested in accordance with its terms
(and in any event not later than December 31st of the year during which such
vesting date occurs) but only if such conditions to vesting are satisfied
prior to such vesting date; _provided_ , that if the employment or service of
such grantee of such PSU is terminated by the Surviving Corporation or its
Affiliates or by the grantee prior to such vesting date under conditions that
would have accelerated the vesting of such PSU had it remained outstanding,
then such vesting shall be accelerated as of the date of such termination of
employment or service.

 

(d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Board of Directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take all such lawful actions as may be necessary to provide for and give
effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.2_.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not
provide any holder of an award or right under any Company Stock Plan with the
right to acquire any capital stock or other equity interest (including any
"phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, or their respective Affiliates.

 

Section 2.3 _Surrender of Shares_.

 

 _Paying Agent_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall enter into an
agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company with a
paying agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed, to act
as agent for the stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company shall become entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, a cash amount in immediately
available funds that, when taken together with available cash of the Company
and its subsidiaries that is deposited with the Paying Agent at the Effective
Time, is sufficient in the aggregate for the Paying Agent to make the payments
of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as provided pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ") in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Shares that will be
converted into the right 

 



-5-  to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_.
The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;
_provided_ , that such investments shall be invested by the Paying Agent in
(i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-
term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest,
(iii) short-term commercial paper obligations rated the highest quality by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or (iv) in money market funds investing solely in a combination
of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a
maturity exceeding three months. Any such investment shall be for the benefit,
and at the risk, of Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from
such investment shall be for the benefit of Parent and may be paid to Parent
from time to time in Parents sole discretion. To the extent that there are
losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for
other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent will
reasonably promptly replace or restore, or shall cause to be replaced or
restored, the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or
other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times,
maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, in the event that the Company or any of its
subsidiaries divests, disposes of, or licenses any assets, properties,
products, rights, services or businesses of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any interest therein pursuant to _Section 6.4(c)_, then
the Company shall deposit in the Exchange Fund prior to the Effective Time
all or such portion of the proceeds received by the Company or its
subsidiaries as may be requested in writing by Parent.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Transmittal Materials_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Paying Agent shall mail
or otherwise provide to each former holder of record of Shares (other than
holders of Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) (A) transmittal materials
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only upon delivery of an "agents
message" regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other
evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request), such transmittal materials to be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration to which such holder of Book-
Entry Shares is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry
Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall upon receipt
by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form ( _it_ _being_
_understood_ that the holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have
surrendered such Shares upon receipt by the Paying Agent of such "agents
message" or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ _ _ _2.3(e)_ ) equal to the
product obtained by 

 



-6-   _multiplying_ (A) the number of Shares represented by such Book-Entry
Shares by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Book-Entry Shares. Any
Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon surrender of any Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Book-Entry Share.

(iii) _Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company or if payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Book-Entry Share
is registered, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the
Book-Entry Share may be issued to such transferee or other Person if the Book-
Entry Share formerly representing such Shares is properly presented to the
Paying Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that any applicable transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid
or are not applicable.

 

(iv) _Unsurrendered_ _Book-Entry Shares; Paying Agent Expenses_. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 2.3(b)_, each Book-Entry Share
(other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender (together with letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions (as applicable))
the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of the Share
represented by such Book-Entry Share as provided pursuant to this _Article
II_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including
those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the
Per Share Merger Consideration.

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the former holders of Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any holder of
Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) who has
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter be entitled
to look to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration in respect of its Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section
2.1(a)_ and subject to compliance with this _Article II_ (after giving effect
to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.3(e)_) upon
delivery of evidence of Book-Entry Shares acceptable to the Surviving
Corporation, without any interest thereon in accordance with the provisions
set forth in _Section 2.3(b)_, upon due surrender of its Book-Entry Shares.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall
be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such time
at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims of
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



-7- (d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any evidence of a Book-Entry Share is presented, and acceptable, to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, subject to
compliance with the procedures set forth in this _Article II_, it shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to
which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ (without
interest and less any applicable withholding Taxes). The Per Share Merger
Consideration paid upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message"
in the case of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article
II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Book-Entry Shares.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Options,
PSUs or Stock Units such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, such deducted or withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Paying
Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Options, PSUs or Stock
Units (as the case may be) in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be.

 

Section 2.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required
thereby), any Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and who are entitled to and have properly demanded appraisal rights
with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, have complied
in all respects with Section 262 of the DGCL, and have not effectively
withdrawn such demand (collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, unless and until such Person shall have
effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost or failed to perfect such Persons
right to appraisal or payment under the DGCL, at which time such Shares shall
be treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the
right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, without interest and after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_
payable upon surrender of the Book-Entry Shares (and related documents) in
accordance with this _Article II_, and such Shares shall not be deemed
Dissenting Shares, and such holder thereof shall cease to have any other
rights with respect to such Shares. Each holder of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive only the payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the provisions of, and as

 



-8-  provided by, Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise
lost or failed to perfect such Persons right to appraisal or payment under
the DGCL. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice (and in any event within
one (1) Business Day) of receiving any demands for appraisal, withdrawals or
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law with respect to appraisal rights. Parent shall have
the right to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to any such demands, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other actions in respect of the stockholders rights of appraisal;
_provided_ that prior to the Effective Time Parent shall consult with the
Company and consider in good faith the Companys advice with respect to
such negotiations and proceedings and the Company shall have the right to
participate in any such negotiations and proceedings. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, and prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company,
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle
or compromise, or settle or compromise or otherwise negotiate, any such
demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or waive any failure
to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise to comply with
the provisions under Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 

Section 2.5 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in
the event that the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time shall have been changed into a different
number of Shares or securities or a different class as a result of
a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
combination, stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, subdivision,
merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, then
the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide to
Parent and the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section
2.5_ shall be construed to permit the Company, any subsidiary of the Company
or any other Person to take any action that is otherwise prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, _Section
5.1_).

standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction
where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so organized, qualified or, to the extent such concept is applicable, in
such good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not,

of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and, except for Parents adoption of
this Agreement in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, no other

or Merger Sub is a party), except, in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii), for

executed fee letter collectively, the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ " and,
together with the Preferred 

 



-32-  Securities Financing Commitments, the " _Third-Party Financing Commitments_
"), pursuant to which the lenders thereto have committed, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth therein, to provide the aggregate amount of the debt
financing set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the
Preferred Securities Financing, the " _Third-Party Financing_ ") and (b) the
executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (including all
exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, collectively, the " _Equity Financing
Commitment_ " and, together with the Preferred Securities Financing
Commitments and the Debt Financing Commitments, the " _Financing Commitments_
"), among Apollo Investment Fund VIII, L.P., Apollo Overseas Partners
(Delaware 892) VIII, L.P., Apollo Overseas Partners (Delaware) VIII, L.P. and
Apollo Overseas Partners VIII, L.P. (collectively, the " _Equity Investors_
") pursuant to which the Equity Investors have committed, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth therein, to invest the cash amount set forth therein
(the " _Equity Financing_ " and together with the Third-Party Financing, the

modified prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement
no such amendment or modification is contemplated, and as of the date of this
Agreement the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments
have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Except for fee letters
(complete copies of which have been provided to the Company, with only fee
amounts, economic terms, market flex provisions and other customary threshold
amounts redacted; _provided_ that Parent represents and warrants that the
market flex provisions in such fee letters do not permit the imposition of
any new conditions (or the expansion of any existing conditions) with respect
to the Debt Financing or any reduction in the amount of the Debt Financing)
and customary fee credit letters or engagement letters, in each case, with
respect to the Debt Financing (none of which adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability, termination or availability of the Debt
Financing or reduce the Debt Financing below the Required Amount (as defined
below), after taking into account the Equity Financing and the Preferred
Securities Financing, on the Closing Date), as of the date hereof there are no
side letters or Contracts to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party related to
the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Financing other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments delivered to the Company
prior to the date hereof. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees in connection with the Financing Commitments that are required to
be paid pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitments on or prior to the
date hereof and Parent will, directly or indirectly, continue to pay in full
any such amounts required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Financing
Commitments as and when they become due and payable on or prior to the Closing
Date. As of the date hereof and subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and are
the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, each
of the other parties thereto. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments. As of the date
hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any
other party thereto under any of the Financing Commitments. As of each of the
date hereof, any date on which any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt
Financing Commitments are exercised that have the effect of reallocating any
commitments contained therein and on the Closing Date, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to constitute an event of default or material breach

 



-33-  on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger
Sub, any other party thereto under the Existing Parent Credit Agreements. Each
of the Existing Parent Credit Agreements is valid and binding on Parent,
Parent Holdings and each of their respective subsidiaries party thereto and,
to the knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto, and is in full force and
effect, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception. Parent has made available to the Company correct and
complete copies of the Existing Parent Credit Agreements. On the Closing Date,
both before and after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be effected on the Closing Date, Parent Inc.
shall have no indebtedness. As of the date hereof, assuming satisfaction of
the conditions precedent set forth in _Section 7.1_ and  _Section 7.2_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing),
Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments applicable to it will not be
satisfied or that the Financing will not be made available to Parent on the
Closing Date. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the
Financing Commitments, Parent and Merger Sub will have on the Closing Date,
funds sufficient to (i) pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, (ii)
pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub
and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger and the
Financing, (iii) pay for any refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates contemplated by this
Agreement or the Financing Commitments and (iv) satisfy all of the other
payment obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
contemplated hereunder (the " _Required Amount_ "). Each of Parent and Merger
Sub affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing or any of its other
obligations under this Agreement that Parent or Merger Sub obtain the
Financing or any other financing for or related to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.9 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent has furnished the Company with a true,
complete and correct copy of the Parent Guarantee. As of the date of this
Agreement, the Parent Guarantee is in full force and effect (assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other parties thereto).
As of the date of this Agreement, the Parent Guarantee constitutes the valid
and binding obligation of the Guarantors and is enforceable in accordance with
its terms subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There is no default
under the Parent Guarantee by the Guarantors, and no event has occurred that
with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a
default thereunder by the Guarantors.

 

Section 4.10 _Ownership of Shares_. As of the date of this Agreement, none of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries beneficially owns
(as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) any Shares or any securities
that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Shares, or holds
any rights to acquire or vote any Shares (other than pursuant to this
Agreement).

Section 4.11 _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of
any class or series of capital stock of Parent or any of its Affiliates
(other than Merger Sub) is necessary to approve this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. The adoption of this
Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall have
occurred immediately following the execution of this Agreement) is the only
vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
Merger Sub necessary to approve this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

 



-34- Section 4.12 _Solvency_. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the obligation of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_ have been satisfied or waived, (b) the representations and
warranties of the Company in _Article III_ are accurate and complete, (c)
the Required Information fairly presents the consolidated financial condition
of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the end of the periods covered
thereby and the consolidated results of earnings of the Company and its
subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby and (d) any financial forecasts
of the Company made available to Parent as of the date hereof have been
prepared in good faith upon assumptions that were reasonable at such time (it
being understood that the Company is not making any representation and
warranty with respect thereto as a result of such assumption in this clause
(d)), then immediately following the Effective Time and after giving effect to
all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Financing, the payment of the aggregate consideration to which the
stockholders of the Company are entitled under _Article II_ , funding of any
obligations of the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries which become due
or payable by the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries in connection
with, or as a result of, the Merger and payment of all related fees and
expenses, the Surviving Corporation and each of its subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, will not: (i) be insolvent (either because its financial
condition is such that the sum of its debts, including contingent and other
liabilities, is greater than the fair market value of its assets or because
the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay
its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature); (ii) have unreasonably small capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged;
or (iii) have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay them as they become
due.

Section 4.13 _Certain Arrangements_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates or any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub or their respective Affiliates has entered into any contract, commitment,
agreement, instrument, obligation, arrangement, understanding or undertaking,
whether written or oral, with any member of the Companys management or
directors that is related to the Company, its subsidiaries or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.14 _Compliance with Laws_. Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
subsidiaries are not, and since January 1, 2009 have not been, in violation
of, and are, and since January 1, 2009 have been, in compliance with, the
Antitrust Laws in all respects, except for any such violation or non-
compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.15 _Certain Competing Businesses_. Except for Parents HSR
Affiliates, none of Parent, Parents subsidiaries, Parents Affiliates, or
Merger Sub, owns more than ten percent (10%) of the voting securities of or
controls or operates any business engaged in, and that competes with, any of
the lines of business in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
engaged, including any business which is engaged in monitored security,
interactive home and business automation, or related monitoring services.

 



-35- Section 4.16 _Ownership_. Other than as set forth on _Schedule 4.16_ of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent owns, directly or indirectly, all of the
capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in,
Protection Holdings II, Inc., ASG Intermediate Holding Corp. and each of their
respective direct and indirect subsidiaries.

Section 4.17 _No Other Information_. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article III_ , each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that neither the Company nor any other Person on behalf of the
Company makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to the Company or with respect to any other information provided to
Parent or Merger Sub. Except for the representations and warranties in this
_Article IV_ , neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any other Person makes any
express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub or their respective Affiliates.

Section 4.18 _Access to Information; Disclaimer_. Parent and Merger Sub each
acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has had an opportunity to discuss the
business of the Company and its subsidiaries with the management of the
Company, (b) has had reasonable access to (i) the books and records of the

afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from officers
of the Company and (d) has conducted its own independent investigation of the

contemplated hereby, and has not relied on any representation, warranty or
other statement by any Person on behalf of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, other than the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in _Article III_ of this Agreement and that all other
representations and warranties are specifically disclaimed. Without
limiting the foregoing, except for the representations and warranties set
forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub
further acknowledges and agrees that none of the Company or any of its
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
other Representatives has made any representation or warranty concerning any

information regarding the Company, its subsidiaries or their respective
businesses and operations. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges
that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to develop such estimates,
projections, forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking information
with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are
taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans and
other forward-looking information furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking information), and that

and the Bylaws and the applicable requirements of the New York Stock Exchange
necessary to promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as
promptly as practicable a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of
approving and adopting this Agreement (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Stockholders Meeting_ "), with the record date
and meeting date of the Stockholders Meeting to be selected after reasonable
consultation with Parent; _provided_ that the Company may postpone, recess or
adjourn such meeting solely (i) to the extent required by Law, (ii) with the
written consent of Parent, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time to
solicit additional proxies to the extent the Company reasonably believes
necessary in order to obtain the Company Requisite Vote or (iv) in the absence

any changes to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by
Parent pursuant to, and in accordance with, _Section 6.1(c)(iii)_ or _Section
6.1(d)_ , as applicable) within five (5) Business Days of a request therefor
by Parent following the date on which any Acquisition Proposal or material
modification thereto is received by the Company or is published, sent or
communicated to the Companys stockholders (or, if the Stockholders Meeting is
scheduled to be held within five (5) Business Days of such request, within one
(1) Business Day after such request and in any event, prior to the date of

change the Recommendation, or formally resolve to effect or publicly announce
an intention to effect any of the foregoing (a " _Change of Recommendation_
") solely in accordance

 



-49-  with _Section 6.1(c)(iii)_ and, following such Change of Recommendation, may
fail to use such reasonable best efforts. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to
hold the Stockholders Meeting prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date or if
this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, unless this

Board of Directors of the Company shall have made a Change of Recommendation,
the Company shall nonetheless submit this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby to the stockholders at the Stockholders
Meeting and shall not submit any alternate Acquisition Proposal for adoption
by the stockholders of the Company.

 

Section 6.4 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to (and, in the case of Parent, cause each of its
subsidiaries its Ultimate Parent Entity (as defined in the HSR Act and
accompanying regulations) and HSR Affiliates (as defined in the HSR Act and
accompanying regulations) (collectively, (the " _Parent Group_ ") to) take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Antitrust Laws and regulations
to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each Party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
(the " _HSR Filing_ ") with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the
date hereof and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested by a Governmental
Entity pursuant to the HSR Act and to take any and all other actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable and (ii) Parent shall prepare
and submit, or shall cause to be prepared and submitted, within five (5)
Business Days of the date hereof, to the Commissioner of Competition a request
for an advance ruling certificate to be issued pursuant to Section 102 of the
Competition Act (Canada) (the " _Canadian Competition Act_ ").

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section
6.4(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations or expiration of
waiting periods for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) subject
to applicable Law, furnish to the other Party as promptly as reasonably
practicable all information required for any application or other filing to be
made by the other party pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) promptly notify the other
Party of any substantive communication received by such party from, or given
by such party to, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other
U.S. or foreign Governmental Entity and of any substantive communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby and, subject
to applicable Law, furnish the other party promptly with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications between them and the FTC, the DOJ,
or any other Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iv)

 



-50-  respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries received
from, and supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information or documentation that may be requested by the DOJ, FTC, or by any
other Governmental Entity in respect of such registrations, declarations and
filings or such transactions; and (v) permit the other Party to review any
substantive communication given by it to, and consult with each other
in advance, and consider in good faith the other Partys reasonable comments
in connection with, any communication, meeting or conference with, the FTC,
the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, with any other Person. Parent may, with the consent of
the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), withdraw the HSR Filing one or more times and shall refile on a date
agreed upon between outside counsel for Parent and the Company. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Antitrust Act of
1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act of 1914 and all other federal, state and foreign, if any,
statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial
doctrines and other laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

(c) No Party shall independently participate in any substantive meeting or
communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings,
investigation or other inquiry relating to _Section 6.4(a)_ or _Section
6.4(b)_ without giving the other Parties sufficient prior notice of the
meeting (to the extent reasonably practicable) and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or participate in such
substantive meeting or communication. Parent shall, and shall cause its HSR
Affiliates and subsidiaries to, take any and all steps necessary to (x)
resolve, avoid, or eliminate impediments or objections, if any, that may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under any Antitrust Law or (y) avoid the entry of, effect the dissolution of,
and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, order or
judgment issued pursuant to any Antitrust Law that would prevent, prohibit,
restrict or materially delay the consummation of the Closing, so as to enable
the Parties to consummate the Closing expeditiously (but in no event later
than the End Date), including, but without limiting the foregoing, (i)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders or otherwise, the sale, divesture, disposition, or license of
any assets, properties, products, rights, services or businesses of Parent,
Parents subsidiaries, Parents HSR Affiliates, or the Company or its
subsidiaries or any interest therein and (ii) otherwise taking or committing
to take actions that would limit Parents, Parents subsidiaries, Parents HSR
Affiliates, or the Companys or its subsidiaries freedom of action with
respect to, or its or their ability to retain any assets, properties,
products, rights, services or businesses of Parent, Parents subsidiaries,
Parents HSR Affiliates, or the Company or its subsidiaries or any interest
or interests therein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or
otherwise, in no event shall Parent, Parents subsidiaries or Parents HSR
Affiliates be required to take any steps or actions (including any
sale, divestiture, disposition, or license of any assets, properties,
products, rights, services or businesses of Parent, Parents subsidiaries, the
Company or the Companys subsidiaries or, in each case, any interest therein)
that, individually or in the aggregate, would represent or result in a loss
of more than $80,500,000 of the recurring monthly revenues of Parent, Parents
subsidiaries, the Company and the Companys subsidiaries taken as a whole;
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Parents
subsidiaries and Parents HSR Affiliates shall not be required under any

 



-51-  circumstances to, directly or indirectly, sell (or agree to sell), whether
by merger, consolidation, operation of law, asset sale or license, sale of
equity interests or otherwise, the Whole of the P1 Business. Parent and
Merger Sub shall not be required to agree to any amendment to, or waiver under
this Agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, agree
to make or effect any divestitures, dispositions, or licenses of any assets,
properties, products, rights, services or businesses, or implement any other
remedy, requirement, obligation, condition or restriction related to the
conduct of it and its subsidiaries businesses (in each case solely to the
extent implementation and effectiveness of such actions are contingent upon
the Closing) pursuant to this _Section 6.4(c)_ to resolve any Governmental
Entitys objections to or concerns about the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement if and to the extent instructed in writing by Parent. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries
not to, make or effect any divestitures, dispositions, or licenses of any
assets, properties, products, rights, services or businesses, or agree to
implement any other remedy, requirement, obligation, condition or restriction
related to the conduct of it and its subsidiaries businesses pursuant to this
_Section 6.4(c)_ , unless so instructed in writing by Parent in order to
resolve any Governmental Entitys objections to or concerns about the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or otherwise, nothing in this _Section 6.4_  shall limit a
Partys right to validly terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_
or _Section 8.1(c)_.

(d) Subject to the obligations under _Section 6.4(c)_ , in the event that any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other
agreement contemplated hereby, (i) each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall, and Parent shall cause each member of the Parent Group to, cooperate in
all material respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub must defend, at
their cost and expense, any action or actions, whether judicial or
administrative, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their HSR Affiliates shall
acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or
by purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner,
any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets or equity interests, if the entering into of a definitive agreement
relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or
consolidation would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay
in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any
consents of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity seeking or entering an order prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii) materially
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or
otherwise.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, commercially and/or competitively
sensitive information and materials of a Party will be provided to the other
Party on an outside counsel-only basis while, to the extent feasible, making a
version in which the commercial and/or competitively sensitive information
has been redacted available to the other Party.

 



-52- Section 6.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such Party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may
be required in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated
herein, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such
Party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent; (b) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such Partys knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of its
subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby; or (c) any change, condition or event (i) that to such Partys
knowledge renders or could reasonably be expected to render any representation
or warranty of such Party set forth in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, or (ii) that results or could reasonably
be expected to result in any failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy
any covenant or agreement, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to
result in any condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ ,
with respect to the Company, or _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ , with
respect to Parent and Merger Sub, not being satisfied hereunder; _provided_
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall not (i)
cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this
Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the Party receiving such
notice.

Section 6.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice from Parent, the Company
shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries,
officers, directors and employees to, afford Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access, consistent with applicable Laws relating to the exchange
of information, at normal business hours to the Companys and its
subsidiaries officers, employees, Representatives, properties, offices, and
other facilities and to all Contracts, commitments, books, records, Tax
Returns and any Tax documents or other written information that the Company
or any of its subsidiaries receives or has received pursuant to a Tax sharing
agreement, and shall furnish Parent reasonably promptly with all financial,
operating and other data and information concerning its business and
properties as Parent or its Representatives, may from time to time reasonably
request (provided that Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such
activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company).

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or
consultation shall not include any environmental sampling or invasive
environmental testing. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall
be required to provide access or to disclose information if the Company
determines in good faith after consultation with counsel that such access or
disclosure would violate an obligation of confidentiality pursuant to any
binding

 



-53-  agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement to which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party so long as the Company shall
have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party
to such access or disclosure, would violate or prejudice its rights or the
rights of any of its officers, directors or employees, jeopardize any
attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (provided
that the Company will enter into a joint defense agreement with Parent if
requested with respect to any such information), or contravene any applicable
Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree. All requests for
information made pursuant to this _Section 6.6(b)_ shall be directed to the
executive officer or other Person designated by the Company.

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will comply with the terms and conditions
of the letter agreement, dated as of May 14, 2014, between the Company and
Apollo Management VIII, L.P. (which agreement shall automatically terminate
and be of no further force and effect upon the Closing, as amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and will hold and treat, and will cause their respective
officers, employees, auditors and other representatives to hold and treat, in
confidence all documents and information concerning the Company and its
subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect each in accordance with its terms. The Company agrees
that it will treat any documents and information concerning the Parent Related
Parties furnished or otherwise made available to the Company, its
subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that meet the definition of
"Confidential Information" under the Confidentiality Agreement and as if the
use and disclosure restrictions thereunder applied to the Company.

Section 6.7 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws and rules and policies of the New York Stock Exchange to
enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from the New
York Stock Exchange as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and
the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act at the Effective
Time.

Section 6.8 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall
be a joint press release and, except in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal or a Change of Recommendation if and to the extent permitted by this
Agreement, thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other
prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity (including any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, except as may be required
by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of
any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the
request of any Governmental Entity, in each case, as determined in the good
faith judgment of the Party proposing to make such release (in which case,
such Party shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release or
other public announcement without prior consultation with the other Party).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates may

 



-54-  provide ordinary course communications regarding this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby to existing or prospective general and
limited partners, equity holders, members, managers and investors of any
Affiliates of such Person, in each case, who are subject to customary
confidentiality restrictions.

Section 6.9  _Employee Benefits_.

(a) For a period of at least one year following the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each
employee of the Company or its subsidiaries who continues to be employed by
the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), (i) a salary, wage, target bonus
opportunity and commissions opportunity that is substantially similar in the
aggregate to the salary, wage, target bonus opportunity and commissions
opportunity that was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) employee pension, welfare and other benefits
(other than any equity-based compensation or benefits) that are substantially
similar in the aggregate to the employee pension, welfare and other benefits
(other than any equity-based compensation or benefits) provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a period of
at least one year following the Effective Time, Parent or one of its
Affiliates shall maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee a
severance or termination arrangement no less favorable than the severance or
termination arrangement provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time. This _Section 6.9(a)_  shall not apply to Continuing
Employees whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by a
collective bargaining agreement.

(b) Parent shall honor and assume, or shall cause to be honored and assumed,
the terms of all Company Plans, subject to the amendment and termination
provisions thereof.

 

(c) The Company, in consultation with Parent, may establish a cash-based bonus
program in the aggregate amount of $1,000,000 to promote retention and to
incentivize efforts to consummate the Closing (the " _Program_ "). Amounts
under the Program shall be allocated among the employees of the Company and
its subsidiaries identified (other than reporting executive officers of the
Company), and in the amounts and on the terms determined by the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company (or his designees). If a retention award or
portion thereof under the Program is forfeited by a participant, the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company (or his designees) may reallocate the award
(or unpaid portion thereof) to existing employees or new hires of the Company
and its subsidiaries.

 

(d) The Company will maintain any Company Plan that is an annual bonus plan as
in effect on the date hereof and disclosed on _Schedule 3.11(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Bonus Plan_ ") and will pay such
bonuses, if any, at such time as the Company has historically paid such
bonuses. The amount of each bonus will be equal to the employees bonus
entitlement as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable Bonus
Plan for the Companys 2016 fiscal year, based on (A) the Companys actual
performance through the end of the Companys 2016 fiscal year, provided that
any one-time costs, expenses and charges solely attributable to the Merger
shall be excluded in determining whether the applicable performance goals have
been attained, and (B) any subjective or individual qualitative performance
metrics shall be deemed attained at 100% of target levels.

 



-55- (e) Parent shall (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and
eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its
Affiliates to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents, (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and
annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the
Effective Time for which payment has been made and (iii) to the extent that it
would not result in a duplication of benefits and to the extent that such
service was recognized under a similar Company Plan, give each Continuing
Employee service credit for such Continuing Employees employment with the
Company for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit (but
excluding benefit accrual) under each applicable Parent benefit plan as if
such service had been performed with Parent; _provided_ that such recognition
of service shall not apply (x) for purposes of any Parent benefit plan under
which similarly situated employees of Parent and its subsidiaries do not
receive credit for prior service, (y) to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits or (z) for purposes of any plan or arrangement that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to the level of benefits or
participation.

(f) If Parent determines that an event would trigger WARN Act obligations
within sixty (60) days following the Effective Time, the Company or the
Companys subsidiaries shall, at Parents reasonable request, distribute WARN
notices on Parents behalf to such employees as directed by Parent in a form
prepared by Parent in compliance with the WARN Act.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.9_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to
be an amendment or other modification of any Benefit Plan, (ii) deemed or
construed to establish any Benefit Plan, (iii) prevent or limit Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent from amending or terminating
any Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms, or (iv) create any third-
party rights in any current or former service provider of the Company or its
Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 

Section 6.10 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and the applicable subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation to
assume all obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for each individual
who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was,
a director or officer of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company (each,
an " _Indemnified Party_ "), for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time as provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement. For a period of six
(6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, provisions of
the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws with
respect to limitation of

 



-56-  liabilities of directors and indemnification and advancement of expenses of
officers and directors of the Company that are no less favorable to the
Indemnified Parties than are set forth in the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement, and shall
not prior to the expiration of such period amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights
to indemnification in respect of any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative and whether formal or informal (each, a " _Proceeding_ ")
made within such six (6) year period shall continue until the disposition or
resolution of such Proceeding in accordance with the Surviving
Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.10_ notwithstanding, any Person to whom an
advancement of expenses is provided in connection with a Proceeding shall be
required to provide, as a condition to such advancement, an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party
is not entitled to indemnification in connection with such Proceeding. In the
event of any such Proceeding (x) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
Proceeding in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in writing
to such settlement, compromise or consent, and (y) the Surviving Corporation
shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter. In the event any
Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party under this _Section
6.10_ , (i) the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time, (ii)
each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel,
whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of
any such Proceeding, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Party reasonably
promptly after statements therefor are received by the Surviving Corporation,
whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of
any such Proceeding, and (iv) no Indemnified Party shall be liable for
any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section
6.10_ , upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall promptly notify the
Surviving Corporation thereof in writing, but the failure to so notify shall
not relieve the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
the Surviving Corporation.

(c) Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for a period of six
(6) years from the Effective Time either (i) the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company as disclosed on  _Schedule 6.10_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule with respect to matters existing or occurring on or prior
to the Effective Time or (ii) any other policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance on terms and conditions
providing benefits that are no less favorable (other than in any de minimis
respect) as such policies of the Company disclosed on _Schedule_ _6.10_

 



-57-   __of the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to matters existing or
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to pay in the aggregate for such coverage under each such policy more
than 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto
under each such policy, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount. At Parents option, Parent may, in
lieu of maintaining or causing the Surviving Corporation to maintain the
coverage provided in the immediately preceding sentence, direct the Company to
purchase a six-year (6) prepaid "tail policy" to incept at the Effective Time
at a cost not exceeding 250% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the current policies of the
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company as of the date hereof disclosed on _Schedule 6.10_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule on terms and conditions providing
substantially equivalent benefits as such current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
at or before the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated
hereby. In the event Parent elects to purchase such a "tail policy" in
accordance with this _Section 6.10(c)_ prior to the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain such "tail policy" in full force and effect for such six (6)-year
period. Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and perform
all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party on the terms and conditions set forth
therein and solely to the extent disclosed on  _Schedule 6.10_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.10_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ shall survive the Merger and,
following the Effective Time, are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and
representatives.

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.10_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or the comparable
governing instruments of any of its subsidiaries, or under any
indemnification Contracts or applicable Laws. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers,
directors and employees, it being understood that the indemnification provided
for in this _Section 6.10_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any
such claims under any such policies.

 



-58- Section 6.11 _Treatment of Company_ _Indebtedness_.

 

(a) The Company shall use, or shall cause its applicable subsidiaries to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for customary payoff letters and
instruments of discharge providing for the payoff, discharge and termination
on the Closing Date of all then-outstanding indebtedness of the Credit
Facility (the " _Debt Payoff Letters_ ") to be delivered to Parent no
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and shall
deliver, or cause its applicable subsidiaries to deliver the Debt Payoff
Letters in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility to the holders of
such indebtedness (provided that such prepayment and termination notices may
be conditional on the occurrence of the Closing).

(b)

 

(i) Parent will be permitted to commence and conduct, in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Indenture, offers to purchase, including any "Change
of Control Offer" (as such term is defined in the applicable Indenture), or
any exchange offer, and to conduct consent solicitations, if any (each, a "
_Debt Offer_ " and collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "), with respect to any
or all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of each series of the
Companys senior unsecured notes (the " _Notes_ ") identified by Parent to the
Company in writing prior to, on, or after the date hereof on terms that are
acceptable to Parent; _provided_ , that any such Debt Offer is consummated
substantially simultaneously with or after the Closing using funds provided by
Parent. Parent shall not be permitted to commence any applicable Debt Offer
until Parent shall have provided the Company with the necessary offer to
purchase, letter of transmittal or other related documents in connection with
the Debt Offer (collectively, the " _Debt Offer Documents_ ") a reasonable
period of time in advance of commencing the applicable Debt Offer to allow the
Company and its counsel to review and comment on such Debt Offer Documents.
Parent will reasonably consult with the Company regarding the timing and
commencement of any Debt Offer and any tender deadlines. The closing of the
Debt Offers shall be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing,
and the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Offers to
close on the Closing Date; _provided_ , that the consummation of a Debt Offer
with respect to any series of Notes shall not be a condition to Closing. The
Debt Offers shall be conducted in compliance with the applicable
Indenture and applicable Law, including SEC rules and regulations, and the
Company shall not be required to cooperate with respect to any Debt Offer that
is not in compliance with the applicable Indenture and applicable Laws. Parent
hereby covenants and agrees to provide (or to cause to be provided)
immediately available funds to the Company for the full payment at the
Effective Time of all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn and any
related consent payments to the extent required pursuant to the terms of the
applicable Debt Offer. The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to, provide all reasonable cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Debt Offer; _provided_ , that nothing herein
shall (x) require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its subsidiaries,
(y) require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to pay any fees or incur
any other liability or obligation in connection with the Debt Offer or be
required to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar
fee or make any other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection
with the Debt Offer or (z) require the Company or its counsel to provide any
negative assurance letter with respect to any Debt Offer.

 



-59- (ii) Subject to the receipt of the requisite consents, the Company shall
execute a supplemental indenture to the indentures governing each series of
Notes in accordance with the applicable indenture and identified by Parent to
the Company in writing prior to, on, or after the date hereof (each, an "
_Indenture_ "), amending the terms and provisions of each such Indenture as
described in the Debt Offer Documents as reasonably requested by Parent, which
supplemental indenture shall become operative no earlier than the Effective
Time, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee under each
such Indenture to enter into such supplemental indenture prior to or
substantially simultaneously with the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event shall the Company or any of its officers, directors or other
Representatives have any obligation to authorize, adopt or execute any
amendments or other agreement that would become effective prior to the
Effective Time. The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives
to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
the execution of supplemental indentures; _provided_ , that nothing herein
shall require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to pay any fees or incur
any other liability or obligation in connection with the Debt Offer or be
required to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar
fee or make any other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection
with the Debt Offer. If requested by Parent, the Companys counsel shall
provide all customary legal opinions required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 6.11_ to the extent such legal
opinion is required to be delivered prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or its legal counsel be required
to give an opinion with respect to a Debt Offer that in the opinion of the
Company or its legal counsel does not comply with applicable Laws or the
applicable Indenture, or an opinion with respect to financing by the Parent.

 

(iii) If requested by Parent in writing, in lieu of Parent commencing a Debt
Offer for any series of Notes, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, to the extent permitted by such series of Notes and the
applicable Indenture, to (A) substantially simultaneously with the Effective
Time, issue a notice of optional redemption for all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes, pursuant to
the redemption provisions of the applicable Indenture and (B) take any other
actions at and after the Effective Time reasonably requested by Parent to
facilitate the satisfaction and discharge of such series of Notes pursuant to
the satisfaction and discharge provisions of the applicable Indenture and the
other provisions of such Indenture applicable thereto; _provided_ , that prior
to the Companys being required to take any of the actions described in
clauses (A) and (B) above, Parent shall have, or shall have caused to be,
deposited with the trustee under the applicable Indenture sufficient funds to
effect such redemption and satisfaction and discharge. The redemption and
satisfaction and discharge of any series of Notes pursuant to the preceding
sentence are referred to collectively as the " _Discharge_ " of such series of
Notes. The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide
all reasonable cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in

 



-60-  connection with the Discharge of any series of Notes identified to the
Company by Parent in writing at any time; _provided_ , that nothing herein
shall require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to pay any fees or incur
any other liability or obligation in connection with the Debt Offer or be
required to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar
fee or make any other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection
with the Debt Offer.

(iv) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company following either the Closing or the termination of this Agreement
for (A) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including
reasonable outside attorneys fees and expenses) to the extent incurred by the
Company, any of the subsidiaries or their Representatives in connection with
the Debt Offers or Discharge in respect of any series of Notes and (B) any
out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company, any of its subsidiaries or their
Representatives to the trustee or its counsel pursuant to the applicable
Indenture in connection with the Debt Offers or Discharge in respect of any
series of Notes. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with any action taken by
them in connection with the performance of their respective obligations under
this _Section 6.11(b)_ (including any action taken in accordance with this
_Section 6.11(b)_ ) except to the extent suffered or incurred as a result of
the bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this
Agreement by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or, in each case,
their respective Affiliates and Representatives.

(v) At the written request of Parent, prior to the retirement of any
Notes pursuant to this _Section 6.11(b)_ , the Company shall negotiate the
contemporaneous unwind of interest rate swaps relating to the Notes.

 

Section 6.12 _Parent Financing_.

 

(a)

(i) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing
on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Financing
Commitments (including complying with any request exercising any "flex"
provisions contained therein), including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Financing Commitments, (ii) satisfy (or, if deemed
advisable by Parent, to obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions
to funding in the Third-Party Financing Commitments and such definitive
agreements to be entered into pursuant thereto (including by consummating the
Equity Financing at or prior to the Closing), (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions described
in the Third-Party Financing Commitments (including any "flex" provisions
contained therein) at or prior to the Closing or not less favorable to Parent
or Merger Sub with respect to conditionality than the terms and conditions
contained in the Third-Party Financing Commitments (including any
"flex" provisions contained therein); _provided_ , that,

 



-61-  notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the documentation relating to the
bridge loan facilities and the backstop facilities shall not be required until
reasonably necessary in connection with the funding of the Debt Financing,
(iv) enforce its rights under the Third-Party Financing Commitments and (v) in
the event that all conditions in the Third-Party Financing Commitments have
been satisfied or waived, cause the Persons providing Third-Party Financing
to fund on the Closing Date the Third-Party Financing necessary to fund the
Required Amount (after taking into account the Equity Financing and the
Preferred Securities Financing). Parent shall obtain the Equity
Financing contemplated by the Equity Financing Commitment upon satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions to Closing in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the
Closing). To the extent requested by the Company from time to time, Parent
shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing (or Alternative Financing) and Parent
shall provide to the Company copies of the definitive agreements related to
the Financing (or Alternative Financing).

 

(ii) In the event any portion of the Third-Party Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions (including after giving effect to any "flex"
provisions) contemplated in the Third-Party Financing Commitments for any
reason, (A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and (B) Parent
and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to
use, their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative third-
party financing from alternative sources in an amount, when added with the
available portion of the Third-Party Financing and the Equity Financing,
sufficient to fund the Required Amount (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, which would
not involve terms and conditions that are materially less beneficial to Parent
or Merger Sub. As applicable, the term "Financing Commitments", "Third-Party
Financing Commitments", "Financing" or "Third-Party Financing" shall include
any Alternative Financing. As of the date of the entry into any
such Alternative Financing, no event shall have occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute an event of default or material breach on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any other party
thereto under the Existing Parent Credit Agreements. In furtherance of, and
not in limitation of, the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, but (i) any
bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments (or
alternative bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this _Section
6.12(a)_ ) are available, (ii) all conditions in the Debt Financing
Commitments have been satisfied or waived and (iii) the conditions precedent
set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at Closing), then
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the proceeds of such bridge
financing to be used in lieu of such contemplated Debt Financing as promptly
as practicable.

 

(iii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall promptly
notify the Company in writing (A) if there exists any material breach,
material default, repudiation, cancellation or termination by any party to the
Financing

 



-62-  Commitments (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
material breach, material default, repudiation, cancellation or termination)
of which Parent becomes aware, (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of
any written notice or other written communication from any financing source
with respect to any (I) actual material breach, default, repudiation,
cancellation or termination by any party to the Financing Commitments or (II)
material dispute or disagreement between Parent and any financing source
related to the Financing or (C) if for any reason Parent, Merger Sub or any
Guarantor believes in good faith that there is a reasonable possibility that
it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the
terms, in the manner contemplated by the Financing Commitments. As soon as
reasonably practicable, (x) Parent shall provide any information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause
(A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(iv) Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors shall not (without the prior
written consent of the Company) consent or agree to any amendment,
replacement, supplement or modification to, or any waiver of any provision
under, the Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing if such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver
(1) decreases the aggregate amount of the Financing to an amount that would
be less than the Required Amount unless the Third-Party Financing or Equity
Financing is increased by a corresponding amount, (2) imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing, in the case of this clause (2), in
a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (3)
adversely impacts the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Financing Commitments. Parent shall furnish
to the Company a copy of any amendment, modification, waiver or consent of or
relating to the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to
the Financing promptly upon execution thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and/or Merger Sub may amend,
replace, supplement and/or modify the Third-Party Financing Commitments to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents, commitment parties,
purchasers or similar entities as parties thereto who had not executed
the Third-Party Financing Commitments as of the date hereof. Upon any
amendment, supplement or modification of the Financing Commitments made in
compliance with this _Section 6.12(a)_ or the definitive agreements relating
to the Financing, Parent shall provide a copy thereof to the Company and the
term "Financing Commitments", "Third-Party Financing Commitments", "Financing"
or "Third-Party Financing" shall mean the Financing Commitments as
so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified, including any Alternative
Financing.

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Parent with this _Section
6.12_ shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing
is available and each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are not contingent on
Parent or Merger Subs ability to obtain the Financing (or any Alternative
Financing) or any specific term with respect to such financing.

 



-63- (vi) Parent shall furnish to the Company a copy of a certificate of a
responsible officer of Parent, dated as of the date hereof, that is delivered
to each of the administrative agents under the Existing Parent Credit
Agreements pursuant to the second paragraph of the definition of "Pro Forma
Basis" therefor.

 

(vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this _Section 6.12_ shall require, and in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Parent and Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require, Parent or Merger Sub to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any source
other than the Equity Investors counterparty to, or in any amount in excess
of that contemplated by, the Equity Financing Commitment or (ii) pay any
material fees in excess of those contemplated by the Equity Financing
Commitment or the Third-Party Financing Commitments (including any
"flex" provisions contained therein).

(viii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent may
enter discussions regarding, and may enter into arrangements and agreements
relating to the Equity Financing to add other equity providers, so long as in
respect of any such arrangements and agreements, the following conditions are
met: (i) the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing is not reduced; (ii)
the arrangements and agreements, in the aggregate, would not be reasonably
likely to delay, impede or prevent the Closing; and (iii) the arrangements and
agreements would not diminish or release the pre-closing obligations of the
parties to the Equity Financing Commitment, adversely affect the rights of
Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Equity Financing
Commitment, or otherwise constitute a waiver or reduction of Parents rights
under the Equity Financing Commitment.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause its subsidiaries
to use reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and Merger Sub, at
Parents sole cost and expense all reasonable cooperation reasonably requested
by Parent that is customary in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that
such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, including using reasonable
best efforts to take the following actions:

(i) as promptly as reasonably practicable, (A) furnishing Parent with the
Required Information;  _provided_ that the Company shall not be obligated to
provide (i) information regarding any post-Closing or pro forma cost savings,
synergies, capitalization, ownership or other post-Closing pro forma
adjustments desired to be incorporated into any information used in
connection with the Third-Party Financing or (ii) (1) a description of the
Financing, including any "description of notes," or other information
customarily provided by the financing sources or their counsel, (2) risk
factors solely relating to all or any component of the Financing or (3)
financial statements or other information (including segment reporting and
consolidating and other financial statements and data) required by Rules 3-10
or 3-16 of Regulation S-X, Compensation

 



-64-  Discussion and Analysis otherwise required by Regulation S-K Item 402(b) or
other information customarily excluded from a Rule 144A offering memorandum;
and (B) informing Parent if the Company or its subsidiaries shall have actual
knowledge of any facts that would likely require the restatement of such
financial statements for such financial statements to comply with GAAP;

 

(ii) assisting in preparation for and participating in marketing efforts
(including a reasonable and limited number of meetings and calls) and a
reasonable number of presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions
(including accounting due diligence sessions), sessions with rating agencies
and sessions with prospective lenders and investors and commitment parties
and purchasers, in each case in connection with the Third-Party Financing at
reasonable times and locations mutually agreed, and assisting Parent in
obtaining ratings as contemplated by the Third-Party Financing;

 

(iii) obtaining customary auditors consents and reports and customary comfort
letters of independent accountants (including customary change period
"negative assurance" comfort), as reasonably requested by Parent as necessary
or customary for financings similar to the Debt Financing (including any
offering or private placement of debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A under
the Securities Act);

(iv) assisting Parent in the preparation by Parent and the debt financing
arrangers of (A) any offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents for any of the Debt
Financing, including reviewing and commenting on Parents draft of a business
description of the Company and "Managements Discussion and Analysis" of the
Companys financial statements to be included in the offering documents and
marketing materials contemplated by the Debt Financing; _provided_ that no
private placement memoranda or prospectuses in relation to high-yield debt or
equity securities will be issued by the Company or any of its subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any such memoranda or prospectuses that includes
disclosure and financial statements with respect to the Company shall only
reflect the Surviving Corporation and/or its subsidiaries as the obligor(s);
and (B) materials for rating agency presentations;

 

(v) executing and delivering (or assisting in the execution and delivery of),
as of the Closing, any pledge and security documents, other definitive
financing documents or other certificates or documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent ( _provided_ that (A) none of the documents or
certificates shall be executed and/or delivered except in connection with the
Closing, (B) the effectiveness thereof shall be conditioned upon, or become
operative after, the occurrence of the Closing and (C) no liability shall be
imposed on the Company, any of its subsidiaries, or any of their respective
officers or employees involved) and otherwise facilitating the pledging of
collateral (including cooperation in connection with the pay-off of existing
indebtedness to the extent contemplated by this Agreement and the release of
related Liens and termination of security interests);

(vi) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing
information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries reasonably required by

 



-65-  regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001 to the
extent requested in writing at least eight (8) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date;

(vii) using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent and Merger Sub in the
preparation of pro forma financial information and pro forma financial
statements by Parent and Merger Sub to the extent required by Parents
financing sources to be included in any offering documents pursuant to Section
3 of Exhibit F of the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided_ , for the avoidance
of doubt, that the Company shall not be required to provide any information or
assistance relating to (A) the proposed aggregate amount of debt and equity
financing, together with assumed interest rates, dividends (if any) and fees
and expenses relating to the incurrence of such debt or equity financing, (B)
any post-Closing or pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization,
ownership or other pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any
information used in connection with the Debt Financing, or (C) any financial
information related to Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any pending or completed acquisition or disposition of a
subsidiary or business by such issuer or borrower) or any adjustments that are
not directly related to the acquisition of the Company by Parent;

 

(viii) providing appropriate representations in connection with the
preparation of financial statements and other financial data of the Company
and its subsidiaries;

(ix) to the extent currently prepared by the Company, using reasonable
best efforts to provide monthly financial statements consistent with the
Companys past practice within fifteen (15) days of the end of each month
prior to the Closing Date; and

 

(x) taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing,
reasonably requested by Parent that are necessary or customary to permit the
consummation of the Third-Party Financing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) nothing in this _Section 6.12_
shall require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, (y) none
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment or other fee or incur any other liability or obligation in
connection with the Third-Party Financing contemplated by the Third-Party
Financing Commitments or be required to bear any cost or expense or to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment or agree to provide
any indemnity in connection with the Third-Party Financing or any of the
foregoing prior to the Effective Time, and (z) nothing in this _Section 6.12_
shall require any action that would conflict with or violate the Companys or
any subsidiaries organizational documents or any Laws or result in, prior to
the Effective Time, the contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected
to result in, prior to the Effective Time, a violation or breach of, or
default under, any Contract to which the Company or its subsidiaries is a
party if such action would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company and its subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, none
of the Company or its subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors
(with respect to any subsidiary of the Company) or employees shall be required
to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the Third-
Party 

 



-66-  Financing contemplated by the Third-Party Financing Commitments that is not
contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing
and no directors of the Company, acting in such capacity, shall be required
to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the Third-
Party Financing.

(c) Parent (i) shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company following either the Closing or the termination of this Agreement for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including (A) reasonable
outside attorneys fees and (B) fees and expenses of the Companys accounting
firms engaged to assist in connection with the Financing, including performing
additional requested procedures, reviewing any offering documents,
participating in any meetings and providing any comfort letters) to the
extent incurred by the Company, any of the subsidiaries or their
Representatives in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its
subsidiaries contemplated by this _Section 6.12_ , (ii) acknowledges
and agrees that, except for obligations of the subsidiaries from and after
the Closing, Company, its subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability to any Person
under any arrangement with respect to the Financing that Parent or Merger Sub
may request in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (iii) shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Third-
Party Financing and the performance of their respective obligations under this
_Section 6.12_ (including any action taken in accordance with this _Section
6.12_ ) and any information utilized in connection therewith, in each case,
except to the extent suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith, gross
negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or, in each case, their respective
Affiliates and Representatives.

(d) The Company hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Company and
its subsidiaries by (i) Parent, Merger Sub and their respective licensees and
(ii) the Guarantors, the Equity Investors and any lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents, commitment parties, purchasers, other equity
or debt providers or similar entities involved in the Financing, in each case,
in connection with the Financing; _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub
shall ensure that such logos are used by the above permitted parties solely
in a manner that is not intended, or that is not reasonably likely, to harm or
disparage the Company or the Companys reputation or goodwill.

 

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts to update any Required Information provided to Parent as may be
necessary so that such Required Information (i) is Compliant, (ii) meets the
applicable requirements set forth in the definition of "Required Information"
and (iii) would not, after giving effect to such update(s), cause
the Marketing Period to cease pursuant to clause (A) or (B) of the proviso
included in the definition of "Marketing Period." For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent may, to most effectively access the financing markets, require the
cooperation of the Company and its subsidiaries under this _Section 6.12_ at
any time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date
hereof and the Closing, including by keeping current the Required Information
and providing any supplements to Parent so that Parent may most effectively
access the financing markets. The Company agrees to (A) file all reports on
Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and Form 8-K (to the extent required to include
financial information pursuant to Item 9.01 thereof) and (B) use its

 



-67-  reasonable best efforts to file all other Forms 8-K, in each case required
to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act prior to the Closing
Date in accordance with the periods required by the Exchange Act.

Section 6.13 _Takeover Statute_ _s_. The Company shall not, and shall cause
its subsidiaries not to, take any action that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause any Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. If any Takeover Law
is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent and the members
of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and shall
use reasonable best efforts to take such actions so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions. Nothing in this
_Section 6.13_ shall be construed to permit Parent or Merger Sub to do any
act that would constitute a violation or breach of, or as a waiver of any of
the Companys rights under, any other provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.14 _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that any stockholder
litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is brought, or threatened in writing to be
brought, against the Company, its officers or any members of its Board of
Directors after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days) notify Parent of any such Transaction
Litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the
status thereof, including, by promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days) providing Parent copies of all proceedings and correspondence
relating to such Transaction Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any Transaction
Litigation and shall consider in good faith Parents advice with respect to
such Transaction Litigation. The Company shall not settle or agree to settle
any Transaction Litigation, or take any action to settle in response to such
Transaction Litigation, without Parents prior written consent.

Section 6.15 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their

terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the failure of any
condition set forth in  _Section 7.1_ , _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ , as
the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was primarily caused by such
Partys breach in any material respect of any provision of this Agreement.

out-of-pocket costs, and in the case of any damages sought by the non-
breaching Party, including for any Willful Breach, such damages shall include
the benefit of the bargain lost by such non-beaching party, taking into
consideration relevant matters including opportunity costs and the time value

that the Parties acknowledge and agree that the immediately preceding proviso

or any Specified Commercial Matter, as applicable. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that nothing in this _Section 8.2_ shall be deemed to affect their

-74- (b) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ or by Parent pursuant to  _Section 8.1(e)(ii_ ), then the Company
shall pay the Company Termination Payment to Parent (or one or more of its
designees), at or prior to the time of termination in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii_ ) or as promptly as reasonably
practicable in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(ii)_
(and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination),
payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 

(ii) this Agreement is validly terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ or _Section 8.1(c)_ or by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)(i)_ and (A) at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the taking of the Company Requisite Vote at the Stockholders Meeting

Representatives, to the Companys stockholders, or shall have otherwise become
publicly known and (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the
Company or any of its subsidiaries shall have entered into a

Payment, such payment to be made concurrently with the earlier of the entry
into such definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and
two (2) Business Days from the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds. For the purpose of this
_Section 8.2(b)(ii)_ , all references in the definition of the term
Acquisition Proposal to "20% or more" will be deemed to be references to "more
than 50%".

 

(iii) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 8.1(f)_ , then the Company shall pay to Parent (or one or more of
its designees) by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal
to that required to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein (including all fees and
expenses of financing sources, counsel, accountants, investment banks,
advisors and consultants to Parent and Merger Sub), up to $30,000,000 at or
prior to the time of such termination.

(iv) (A) this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(g)_ or (B) (x) this Agreement is validly terminated by the

of $421,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, such payment to be made within two (2) Business
Days of the applicable valid termination.

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that each of the Parent
Termination Fee and the Company Termination Payment, as applicable, if, as
and when required pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ , shall not constitute a
penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the party receiving such amount in the circumstances in 

 



-75-  which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The Parties acknowledge
and hereby agree that in no event shall either the Company be required to pay
the Company Termination Payment or Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee, as the case may be, on more than one occasion.

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the

agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. If the
Company fails to timely pay an amount due pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ ,
_Section 8.2(b)(ii)_ or _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_ , or Parent fails to timely pay
an amount due pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(iv)_ , and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, commences a suit that results in a final and non-appealable judgment
against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ , _Section
8.2(b)(ii)_ or  _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_ , or any portion thereof, or a final
and non-appealable judgement against Parent for the amount set forth in
_Section 8.2(b)(iv)_ , the Company shall pay to Parent, or Parent shall pay to
the Company, its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees and the
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of any expert or
consultant engaged by the Company) up to a maximum aggregate amount of
$2,500,000 in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
of such payment from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition_ in effect on the date of such payment. Any amount payable
pursuant to this _Section 8.2(d)_ shall be paid by the applicable Party by
wire transfer of same day funds prior to or on the date such payment
is required to be made under this _Section 8.2(d)_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any
Transaction Document or any other agreement referenced herein or therein or
otherwise, but subject in all respects to this _Section 8.2_ , _Section 9.12_
and _Section 9.16_ (including, in each case, the limitations set forth
therein), if Parent or Merger Sub fails to effect the Closing when required
by _Section 1.2_ for any or no reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement or
any Transaction Document (whether such breach is intentional, unintentional,
willful or otherwise) or fails to perform hereunder or thereunder or fails to
perform any obligation under Law (in each case, whether such failure is
intentional, unintentional, willful or otherwise), then the Companys right to
(A) a decree or order of specific performance or any injunction or
injunctions or other equitable relief if and to the extent permitted by
_Section 9.12_ , (B) validly terminate the Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_
and seek monetary damages for Parents fraud and (C) validly terminate the
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_ and if, as and
when required pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(iv)_ , receive payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, shall, together with, if applicable, the rights of the
Company pursuant to _Section 6.11(b)(iv)_ , _Section 6.12(c)_ , _Section
8.2(d)_ and the second and third sentences of _Section 8.3_ , be the sole and
exclusive remedies (whether at Law, in equity, in Contract, in tort
or otherwise) of the Company, its Affiliates, and its and their respective
stockholders and Representatives and any other Person against the Parent
Related Parties for any breach, liability, cost, expense, obligation, loss or
damage suffered as a result thereof or in connection therewith or related
thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, under no circumstances can
the Company receive both

 



-76-  (i) an award of monetary damages, on the one hand, and (ii) any of the
Parent Termination Fee and/or any of the amounts, if any, as and when due,
pursuant to _Section 6.11(b)(iv)_ ,  _Section 6.12(c)_ , _Section 8.2(d)_ and
the second and third sentences of _Section 8.3_ , on the other hand.

(f) Except (A) as provided in _Section 8.2(e)_ or (B) claims, if any, against
any Person that is party to and solely pursuant to the terms and conditions
of, the Confidentiality Agreement, no Parent Related Party will have any
liability or obligation to the Company, its Affiliates or any of their
respective stockholders or Representatives (or any other Person), including
any multiple, consequential, indirect, special, statutory, exemplary or
punitive damages, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or any documents referenced herein or therein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein or therein, or the
failure of such transactions to be consummated, or in respect of any other
Contract, document or theory of Law or equity or in respect of any
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether in equity or at Law, in Contract, in tort or otherwise.
The Company acknowledges and agrees that none of Parents or Merger Subs
financing sources under the Third-Party Financing, any of their Affiliates,
and any of their respective former, current, or future general or limited
partners, equity holders, directors, officers, managers, members, employees,
representatives, agents, controlling persons or entities or any of their
respective successors or assigns (a " _Financing Source Related Party_ ")
shall have any liability or obligation to the Company, its Affiliates or any
of their respective equity holders or Representatives (or any other Person)
arising out of their breach or failure to perform (whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) any of their
obligations under the Financing Commitments. Without limiting the foregoing,
upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, if, as and when required pursuant
to _Section 8.2(b)(iv)_  and the amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant
to _Section 6.11(b)(iv)_ , _Section 6.12(c)_ , _Section 8.2(d)_ and the second
and third sentences of _Section 8.3_ , no Parent Related Party shall have any
further liability or obligation to the Company, its Affiliates or any of
their respective stockholders or Representatives (or any other Person),
including any multiple, consequential, indirect, special, statutory, exemplary
or punitive damages, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document or any documents referenced herein or therein or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein or therein, or
the failure of such transactions to be consummated, or in respect of any

subject in all respects to this _Section 9.12_ , the Parties shall be entitled
to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent

Section 9.13  _Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties irrevocably (a) consents to

proceeding, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, or
in the event (but only in the event) that such United States District Court
for the District of Delaware also does not have subject matter jurisdiction
over such legal action or proceeding, any Delaware state court sitting in New

Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement hereof and thereof, (b) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by

the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth in _Section 9.4_ shall be effective service of process for
any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
_Section 9.13_ , that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction
of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, that the suit, action or proceeding in any
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and further
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution
or collection of any amount to which the Party is

 



-94-  entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction.
Each Party expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to be
irrevocable under the Laws of the State of Delaware and of the United States
of America; _provided_ , that each such Partys consent to jurisdiction and
service contained in this _Section 9.13_ is solely for the purpose referred to
in this _Section 9.13_ and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to
said courts or in the State of Delaware other than for such purpose.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees, on behalf of itself and its Related
Parties, that it will not bring or support any litigation against any
Financing Source Related Party in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Third-Party Financing or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in
the borough of Manhattan of the City of New York, whether a state or federal
court, and that the provisions of _Section 9.14_ relating to the waiver of
jury trial shall apply to any such action, suit or proceeding. Parent
irrevocably designates the Corporation Trust Company as its agent and
attorney-in-fact for the acceptance of service of process and making an
appearance on its behalf in any such claim or proceeding and for the taking of
all such acts as may be necessary, proper or advisable in order to confer
jurisdiction over it, and Parent stipulates that such consent and appointment
are irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE
RELATED PARTY) OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF.

 _A MENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE SURVIVING
CORPORATION_

 

(SEE ATTACHED.) _Exhibit A-1_

 

AMENDED AND RESTATED

 

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF

 

THE ADT CORPORATION

(a Delaware corporation)

ARTICLE I

 

The name of the Corporation is The ADT Corporation.

 

ARTICLE II

The address of the Corporations registered office in the State of Delaware
is Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington,
New Castle County, Delaware 19808. The name of the Corporations registered
agent at such address is Corporation Service Company.

ARTICLE III

 

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware as it now exists or may hereafter be amended and/or
supplemented from time to time (the " _DGCL_ ").

 

ARTICLE IV

The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation is
authorized to issue is one thousand (1,000) shares of capital stock, all of
which shall be common stock with a par value of one cent ($0.01) per share
(the " _Common Stock_ "). Each holder of record of Common Stock shall be
entitled to vote at all meetings of the stockholders and shall have one vote
for each share held by such holder of record.

 

ARTICLE V

From time to time, any of the provisions of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered or repealed, and other
provisions authorized by the DGCL or other statutes or laws of the State of
Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted in the manner and at
the time prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred upon
the stockholders of the Corporation by this Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation are granted subject to this reservation. 

ARTICLE VI

In furtherance and not in limitation of the rights, powers, privileges and
discretionary authority granted or conferred by the DGCL or other statutes or
laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors of the Corporation
(the " _Board_ ") is expressly authorized to make, alter, amend or repeal the
Bylaws of the Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "), without any action on the part
of the stockholders, but the stockholders may make, alter, amend or repeal
the Bylaws whether adopted by them or otherwise. ARTICLE VII

 

Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws shall so
require.

 

ARTICLE VIII

To the fullest extent permitted by law, as it now exists or may hereafter be
amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty owed to the Corporation or its stockholders. Neither the amendment nor
repeal of this Article VIII, nor the adoption of any provision of this Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, nor, to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, any modification of law shall eliminate, reduce or
otherwise adversely affect any right or protection of a current or former
director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal,
adoption or modification. If the DGCL is hereafter amended to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of
directors, then the liability of a director shall be eliminated or limited to
the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.

 

ARTICLE IX

Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware,
as the Bylaws may provide. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any
annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding Common Stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and
shall be delivered to the Corporation.

 

The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained
in the DGCL) within or outside of the State of Delaware at such place or
places as may be designated from time to time by the Board or in the Bylaws.

ARTICLE X

 

Neither any contract or other transaction between the Corporation and any
other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
firm, association, or other entity (an " _Entity_ "), nor any other acts of
the Corporation with relation to any other Entity will, in the absence of
fraud, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in any way
be invalidated or otherwise affected by the fact that any one or more of the
directors or officers of the Corporation are pecuniary or otherwise interested
in, or are directors, officers, partners, or members of, such other Entity
(such directors, officers, and Entities, each a " _Related Person_ "). Any
Related Person may be a party to, or may be pecuniary or otherwise interested
in, any contract or transaction of the Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the fact that person is a Related Person or is pecuniary or otherwise
interested in such contract or transaction is disclosed or is known to the
Board or a majority of directors present at any meeting of the Board at which
action upon any such contract or transaction is taken. Any director of the
Corporation who is also a Related Person or who is pecuniary or otherwise
interested in such contract or transaction may be counted in determining the
existence of a quorum at any meeting of the Board during which any such
contract or transaction is authorized and may vote thereat to authorize any
such contract or transaction, with like force and effect as if such person
were not a Related Person or were not pecuniary or otherwise interested
in such contract or transaction. Any director of the Corporation may vote
upon any contract or any other transaction between the Corporation and any
subsidiary or affiliated Entity without regard to the fact that such person is
also a director, officer, manager, general partner or other fiduciary of such
subsidiary or affiliated Entity. Any contract, transaction or act of the Corporation or of the directors of the
Corporation that is ratified at any annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation, or at any special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation
called for such purpose, will, insofar as permitted by applicable law, be as
valid and as binding as though ratified by every stockholder of the
Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure of the stockholders to
approve or ratify any such contract, transaction or act, when and if
submitted, will not be deemed in any way to invalidate the same or deprive
the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees, of its or their right
to proceed with such contract, transaction or act.

 

Subject to any express agreement that may from time to time be in effect, (x)
any director or officer of the Corporation who is also an officer, director,
partner, employee, managing director or other affiliate of either Apollo
Management VIII, L.P., on behalf of its investment funds (" _Apollo_ "), or
any of its respective affiliates (collectively, the " _Managers_ ") and (y)
the Managers and their affiliates, may, and shall have no duty not to, in each
case on behalf of the Managers or their affiliates (the persons and entities
in clauses (x) and (y), each a " _Covered Manager Person_ "), to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, (i) carry on and conduct, whether
directly, or as a partner in any partnership, or as a member or manager in any
limited liability company or as a joint venturer in any joint venture, or as
an officer, director or stockholder of any corporation, or as a participant in
any syndicate, pool, trust or association, any business of any kind, nature or
description, whether or not such business is competitive with or in the
same or similar lines of business as the Corporation, (ii) do business with
any client, customer, vendor or lessor of any of the Corporation or its
affiliates, and (iii) make investments in any kind of property in which the
Corporation may make investments. To the fullest extent permitted by Section
122(17) of the DGCL, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or
expectancy of the Corporation to participate in any business of the Managers
or their affiliates, and waives any claim against a Covered Manager Person
and shall indemnify a Covered Manager Person against any claim that such
Covered Manager Person is liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of such persons or entitys
participation in any such business.

In the event that a Covered Manager Person acquires knowledge of a
potential transaction or matter which may constitute a corporate opportunity
for both (x) the Covered Manager Person, in his or her Apollo-related
capacity, as the case may be, or Apollo or its affiliates, as the case may be,
and (y) the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Covered
Manager Person shall not have any duty to offer or communicate information
regarding such corporate opportunity to the Corporation. To the fullest extent
permitted by Section 122(17) of the DGCL, the Corporation hereby renounces
any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in such corporate opportunity
and waives any claim against each Covered Manager Person and shall indemnify a
Covered Manager Person against any claim that such Covered Manager Person is
liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty
solely by reason of the fact that such Covered Manager Person (i) pursues or
acquires any corporate opportunity for its own account or the account of any
affiliate, (ii) directs, recommends, sells, assigns or otherwise transfers
such corporate opportunity to another person or (iii) does not communicate
information regarding such corporate opportunity to the Corporation.

 

Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest
in any shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have
notice of and to have consented to the provisions of this Article X.

This Article X may not be amended, modified or repealed without the prior
written consent of each of the Managers. In the event of a conflict between this Article X and any other Article or
provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, this
Article X shall prevail under all circumstances. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, under no circumstances shall any employee of the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries be deemed to be a "Covered Manager
Person", and under no circumstances shall the Corporation waive or renounce
any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or in being offered any
opportunity to participate in, any business opportunities that are presented
to any Manager who is also an employee of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries, irrespective of whether such employee is a director or officer
of the Corporation of any of its affiliates.

 

ARTICLE XI

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any
action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director,
officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation
or the Corporations stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim arising
pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or (d) any action asserting a claim
governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or
otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the
Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions
of this Article XI.

ARTICLE XII

 

The Corporation elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL. _E XHIBIT A-2 _

 

 _A MENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION_

(SEE ATTACHED.) _Exhibit A-2_

 

AMENDED and RESTATED BYLAWS

 

OF

THE ADT CORPORATION 

(Adopted [ ● ], 201[ ● ])

 

ARTICLE I

_Offices_

 

Section 1. _Registered Office; Registered Agent_. The registered office of The
ADT Corporation (the " _Corporation_ ") in the State of Delaware, and the
name of its registered agent at such address, shall be as set forth in the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (as the same may be amended
and/or restated from time to time, the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ").
The Corporations registered agent in the State of Delaware, and the address
of such registered agent, may be changed from time to time by or under the
authority of the board of directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of
Directors_ ") in the manner provided in the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

 

Section 2. _Other Offices_. The Corporation may have a principal or other
office or offices at such other place or places, either within or without the
State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine
or as shall be necessary or appropriate for the conduct of the business of the
Corporation.

 

ARTICLE II

_Stockholders _

Section 1. _Place of Meetings_. All meetings of stockholders shall be held at
the principal office of the Corporation or at such other place, if any,
within or without the State of Delaware, or by means of remote communication,
as may be designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the
meeting.

 

Section 2. _Annual Meetings_. An annual meeting of stockholders for the
election of directors and the transaction of such other business as may
properly come before the meeting shall be held on such day and at such hour,
as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors and designated in the notice of
the meeting. At each annual meeting, the stockholders entitled to vote shall
elect a Board of Directors and may transact such other corporate business as
may properly be brought before the meeting.

Section 3.  _Special Meetings_. A special meeting of the stockholders (or of
any class thereof) for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by
the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or by order of the Board of
Directors and shall be called by the President or the Secretary upon the
written request therefor delivered to the President or Secretary signed by
stockholders holding of record more than 50% of the outstanding shares of
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting. Such written
request shall state the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is to be
called and the call therefor shall be issued within 60 days after the receipt
of said request. Business transacted at all special meetings shall be
confined to the objects specifically stated in the call therefor.

Section 4. _Notice of Meetings_. Except as otherwise expressly required by
law, written notice of each meeting of stockholders, whether annual or
special, shall be given at least 10 and  not more than 60 days before the date on which the meeting is to be held to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat by delivering a notice
thereof to such stockholder personally or by mailing such notice in a postage
prepaid envelope directed to such stockholder at such stockholders address as
it appears on the stock ledger of the Corporation, unless such stockholder
shall have filed with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that
notices intended for such stockholder be directed to another address, in which
case such notice shall be directed to such stockholder at the address
designated in such request. Notices of each meeting of stockholders,
whether annual or special, shall set forth the date, time, place, if any, the
means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders or proxy holders
may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting (if
such date is different from the record date for stockholders entitled to
notice of the meeting). Notices of each special meeting of stockholders shall
also set forth the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. In
lieu of written notice, notice may be given by electronic transmission if
permitted by applicable law and if given in compliance therewith. If
electronically transmitted by means of facsimile telecommunication or
electronic mail, then notice is deemed given when transmitted and directed to
a facsimile number or electronic mail address, as the case may be, at which
the stockholder has consented to receive notice. If mailed, notice shall be
deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
directed to the stockholder in the manner set forth herein. An affidavit of
the Secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation that
the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be _prima facie_
evidence of the facts stated therein.

Section 5. _List of Stockholders_. The Secretary or any Assistant Secretary
of the Corporation shall produce, at least 10 days before every meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote thereat
(provided, however, if the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days before the date of
the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of
the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and
showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered
in the name of such stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of
any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at
least 10 days prior to the meeting, either on a reasonably accessible
electronic network as permitted by law (provided that the information required
to gain access to the list is provided with the notice of the meeting) or
during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the
Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, such list shall be
produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time
thereof and may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting
is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall
also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of
the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network (provided that the
information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of
the meeting). Except as otherwise provided by law, the original or duplicate
stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to the stockholders entitled to
examine such list or to vote in person or by proxy at such meeting.

Section 6. _Quorum; Adjournment of Meetings_. Except as otherwise provided by
law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Amended and Restated Bylaws of
the Corporation (" _Bylaws_ "), the presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock
entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business at all meetings of the stockholders. The stockholders present at a
duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do
business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough
stockholders to leave less than a quorum. If less than a quorum shall be
present or represented at the time for which the meeting shall have been
called, the stockholders so present in person or by proxy at such meeting may,
by a majority in voting power thereof, adjourn the meeting from time to time
without any notice or call other than by an announcement at the meeting of the
time and place of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum shall attend. Any
meeting or adjournment thereof at which a quorum  is present may also be adjourned in like manner without notice or call or
upon such notice or call as may be determined by vote of the holders of a
majority in voting power voting thereon. If, however, the adjournment is for
more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If after the
adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to
vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such
adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination
of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give
notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record
date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. At any adjourned meeting
at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which
might have been transacted if the meeting had been held as originally called.

 

Section 7. _Voting_. Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation, at every meeting of stockholders, each holder of record of the
issued and outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such
meeting shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each such
share of stock having voting power upon the matter in question held by such
stockholder. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders
or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may
authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but
no proxy shall be voted after three years from its date unless the proxy
provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it
states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with
an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may
remain irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled
is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation
generally. Shares of its own capital stock belonging to the Corporation
directly or indirectly shall not be voted directly or indirectly; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to
vote any shares of the Corporations stock held by it in a fiduciary
capacity (and to count such shares for purposes of determining a quorum).
Except as otherwise required by the laws of the State of Delaware or the
Certificate of Incorporation, and except for the election of directors, at all
meetings of the stockholders, a quorum being present, all matters shall be
decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power
of the shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are present in person or
by proxy. Directors shall be elected by plurality of the votes cast at a
meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. Unless
demanded by a stockholder of the Corporation present in person or by proxy at
any meeting of the stockholders and entitled to vote thereat before
the meeting begins, or so directed by the person presiding at the meeting or
required by the laws of the State of Delaware, the election of directors of
the Corporation or the vote on any other question presented at the meeting
need not be by ballot. On any vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by
the stockholder voting, or in such stockholders name by such stockholders
proxy, if there be such a proxy, and shall state the number of shares voted by
such stockholder and the number of votes to which each share is entitled.

Section 8. _Organization of Meeting_. The Chairman of the Board, if any, shall
preside at all meetings of stockholders, or in his or her absence, the Vice
Chairman of the Board, if any, shall preside, or in his or her absence, the
President of the Corporation shall preside. If neither the Chairman of the
Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board or the President is present at the
meeting, the holders of a majority of the shares present at the meeting and
entitled to vote, in person or by proxy, shall select a person to preside at
the meeting. Subject to the requirements of any applicable law or the rules
and regulations of any national securities exchange, national securities
association or interdealer quotation system upon which the Corporations
securities may be listed, the person presiding at a meeting of stockholders
shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting,
including, without limitation, the regulation of the manner of voting and the
conduct of any discussion, as he or she believes to be in order. The Secretary
of the Corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of stockholders, or
in his or her absence, any Assistant Secretary of the Corporation who is
present shall act as secretary of the meeting, or if no Assistant Secretary
shall be present, the person presiding at such meeting shall appoint a
secretary for that particular meeting. Section 9. _Action Without a Meeting_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at
any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in
writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such corporate action at a meeting at which
all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be
delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law. Prompt notice
of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous
consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in
writing. In the event that the action which is consented to is such as would
have required the filing of a certificate with any governmental body, if such
action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, the
certificate filed shall state, in lieu of any statement required by law
concerning any vote of stockholders, that consent had been given in accordance
with the provisions of Section 228 of the DGCL. Without limiting the manner by
which consent may be given, written consent may be given by means of
electronic transmission in the manner prescribed by Section 228 of the DGCL.

 

Section 10. _Ratification of Acts of Directors and Officers_. Except as
otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, any
transaction or contract or act of the Corporation or of the directors or the
officers of the Corporation may be ratified by the affirmative vote of the
holders of the number of shares which would have been necessary to
approve such transaction, contract or act at a meeting of stockholders, or by
the written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting.

ARTICLE III

_Board of Directors_

 

Section 1. _General Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall
be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors, except as may
be otherwise provided by the DGCL or the Certificate of Incorporation.

Section 2. _Number of Directors; Term of Office_. The Board of Directors
shall consist of three members but may be increased or decreased as
hereinafter provided. Each director shall hold office until the annual meeting
of the stockholders next following his or her election and until his or her
successor shall have been elected and shall qualify, or until his or her
death, resignation or removal from office. At any time or from time to time at
a special meeting called for that purpose, the Board of Directors, by the
vote of a majority of the entire Board, may increase the number of directors
of the Corporation, or may decrease the number of directors of the
Corporation; provided, however, that in no event shall the number of directors
of the Corporation be less than one. Directors shall be elected at the annual
meeting of stockholders. Directors need not be stockholders or residents of
the State of Delaware. Except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, elections
of directors need not be by written ballot.

Section 3. _Quorum; Manner of Acting; Telephonic Participation_. Unless
otherwise provided by law, the presence of a majority of the entire Board of
Directors shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business. In the absence of a quorum, the directors present shall adjourn the
meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present. Notice of any
adjourned meeting need not be given. At all meetings of the directors, a
quorum being present, all matters shall be decided by the affirmative vote of
a majority of the directors present, except as otherwise required by the laws
of the State of Delaware or the Certificate of Incorporation. All or any one
or more directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or of
any committee thereof by means of conference telephone or   similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating
in the meeting can hear each other and participation in a meeting pursuant to
such communications equipment shall constitute presence in person at such
meeting. The minutes of any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any
committee thereof held by telephone shall be prepared in the same manner as a
meeting of the Board of Directors or of such committee held in person.

Section 4. _Place of Meetings_. The Board of Directors may hold its meetings
at such place or places, within or without the State of Delaware, as the
Board of Directors may from time to time determine.

Section 5. _Annual Meeting_. As promptly as practicable after each annual
meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors, the Board of
Directors shall meet for the purpose of the appointment of officers and the
transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting.
Notice of such meeting need not be given if held immediately after the annual
meeting of stockholders. Such meeting may be held at any other time or place
as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special
meetings of the Board of Directors or in a waiver of notice thereof signed by
all the directors.

Section 6. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may
be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Delaware, as
shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors. After there
has been such determination, and notice thereof has been given to each member
of the Board of Directors, regular meetings may be held without further notice
being given.

 

Section 7. _Special Meetings and Notice Thereof_. Special meetings of the
Board of Directors shall be held whenever called by the Chairman of the
Board, if any, the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or by a
majority of the directors. Notice of the time, date and place of each such
meeting shall be mailed to each director, addressed to him or her at his
or her residence or usual place of business, at least four days before the
date on which the meeting is to be held, or shall be given to him or her by
telegram, telex, mailgram, facsimile transmission, electronic mail or other
means of electronic transmission, or be delivered personally or by telephone,
not later than the day before the day on which such meeting is to be held.
Such notice shall state the time and place of the meeting, but need not state
the purposes thereof. In lieu of the notice to be given as set forth above, a
waiver thereof in writing, signed by the director or directors entitled to
said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent thereto for purposes of this Section 7. If mailed, such notice
shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail so
addressed, with first-class postage thereon prepaid. If sent by any other
means (including facsimile, courier, electronic mail or express mail, etc.),
such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when actually delivered to the
home or business address, electronic address or facsimile number of the
director. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting, and objects at the beginning of the meeting, to
the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings of the
Board of Directors may fix any place, either within or without the State of
Delaware, as the place for holding any special meeting of the Board of
Directors called by them.

 

Section 8. _Removal_. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of
Incorporation or applicable law, the entire Board of Directors or any
individual director may be removed from office with or without cause by the
holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding stock entitled to
vote at an election of directors. In case the Board of Directors or any one
or more directors be so removed, one or more individuals may be appointed at
the same meeting at which such director or directors have been so removed to
fill the vacancy or vacancies created thereby, to serve for the remainder of
the terms, respectively, of the director or directors so removed. Section 9. _Resignation_. Any director of the Corporation may resign at any
time by giving written notice thereof to the Chairman of the Board, if any,
the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or the Secretary of the
Corporation. The resignation of any director shall take effect upon receipt of
notice thereof or at such later time as shall be specified in such notice;
and, unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation
shall not be necessary to make it effective.

 

Section 10. _Vacancies on Board of Directors_. If any vacancy occurs in the
Board of Directors caused by the death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal from office of any director or otherwise, or any
new directorship is created by any increase in the authorized number of
directors, a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a
quorum, may fill the vacancy or newly created directorship, as the case may
be, or such vacancy or newly created directorship may be filled at an annual
meeting or at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose.
Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of
stockholders and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall be
qualified or until his or her death, resignation or removal from office.

 

Section 11 _Waiver of Notice and Consent_. The transactions of any meeting of
the Board of Directors, however called and noticed or wherever held, shall be
as valid as though such meeting had been duly held after a regular call and
notice, if a quorum be present and if, before or after the meeting, each of
the directors not present signs or electronically transmits a written waiver
of notice of such meeting whether before or after the date stated therein.
Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or
special meeting of directors or members of a committee of directors need be
specified in any written waiver of notice. All such waivers shall be filed
with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.

 

Section 12. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may, by resolution of the
Board of Directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to
consist of one or more directors of the Corporation, which, to the extent
provided in the resolution or in these Bylaws, shall have and may exercise
such powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business
and affairs of the Corporation, as the Board of Directors may by resolution
determine and specify in the respective resolutions appointing them, subject
to such restrictions as may be contained in the Certificate of Incorporation
or the laws of the State of Delaware. Such committee or committees shall have
such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolutions
adopted by the Board of Directors. The committees shall keep regular minutes
of their proceedings and report the same to the Board of Directors when
required. A majority of all the members of any such committee may fix its
rules of procedure, determine its action and fix the time and place, whether
within or without the State of Delaware, of its meetings and specify what
notice thereof, if any, shall be given, unless the Board of Directors shall
otherwise by resolution provide. The Board of Directors shall have the power
to change the membership of any such committee at any time, to fill
vacancies thereon and to discharge any such committee, either with or without
cause, at any time. Each member of any such committee shall be paid such fee,
if any, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors for each meeting of such
committee which he or she shall attend and for his or her expenses, if any,
of attendance at each regular or special meeting of such committee as shall be
determined by the Board of Directors.

 

Section 13. _Action Without Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to be
taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof
may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or of
such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, or by
electronic transmission and the writing or writings or electronic
transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of
the Board of Directors, or committee.

Section 14. _Fees and Compensation_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may, if
it so desires, authorize members of the Board of Directors to be compensated
for their expenses, if any, of attendance at each regular or special meeting
of the Board of Directors. Such compensation may, in the Board of Directors
discretion, also include a fixed sum for each meeting and an annual fee for
serving as a director, such as may be allowed by resolution of the Board of
Directors. Directors who are officers or employees of the Corporation may
receive, if the Board of Directors desires, fees for serving as directors.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any director
from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation
therefor. ARTICLE IV

_Capital Stock_

 

Section 1. _Certificates of Shares_. The shares of the Corporation shall be
represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide
by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series
of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not
apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is
surrendered to the Corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a
resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock represented by
certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name
of the Corporation by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of
Directors, or the President or Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an
Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
Corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, where any such certificate is signed (a) by a
transfer agent or an assistant transfer agent, or (b) by a transfer clerk
acting on behalf of the Corporation and a registrar, if the Board of
Directors shall by resolution so authorize, the signature of such Chairman of
the Board, President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary, Assistant
Treasurer or Assistant Secretary may be facsimiles thereof. In case any
officer or officers of the Corporation who shall have signed, or whose
facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on, any such
certificate shall cease to be such officer or officers, whether by reason of
death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate shall have been
delivered by the Corporation, such certificate may nevertheless be adopted by
the Corporation and be issued and delivered as though the person or persons
who signed such certificate, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall
have been affixed thereto, had not ceased to be such officer or officers. Section 2. _Stock Ledger_. A record shall be kept by the Secretary, transfer
agent or by any other officer, employee or agent designated by the Board of
Directors of the name of the person, firm or corporation holding the stock
represented by such certificate, the number of shares represented by such
certificate, and the date of issuance thereof, and in case of cancellation,
the date of cancellation.

Section 3. _Cancellation_. Every certificate surrendered to the Corporation
for exchange or transfer shall be cancelled, and no new certificate or
certificates shall be issued in exchange for any existing certificate until
such existing certificate shall have been so cancelled, except in cases
provided for in Section 6 of this Article V.

Section 4. _Transfers of Stock_. Transfers of shares of the capital stock of
the Corporation shall be made only on the books of the Corporation by the
registered holder thereof, or by his attorney thereunto authorized by power of
attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation or with
a transfer clerk or a transfer agent appointed as provided in Section 5 of
this Article V, and on surrender of the certificate or certificates, if any,
for such shares properly endorsed and the payment of all taxes thereon. The
person in whose name shares of stock stand on the books of the Corporation
shall be deemed the owner thereof for all purposes as regards the Corporation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that whenever any transfer of shares shall be made
for collateral security, and not absolutely, such fact, if known to the
Secretary of the Corporation, shall be so expressed in the entry of transfer.

Section 5. _Regulations_. The Board of Directors may make such rules and
regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, concerning the issue, transfer and registration
of shares of the stock of the Corporation. It may appoint, or authorize any
principal officer or officers to appoint, one or more transfer clerks or one
or more transfer agents and one or more registrars, and may require all
certificates of stock to bear the signature or signatures of any of them. 

Section 6. _Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates_. As a condition
to the issue of a new certificate or uncertificated shares of stock in the
place of any certificate theretofore issued and alleged to have been lost,
stolen, mutilated or destroyed, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may
require the owner of any such certificate, or his legal representatives, to
give the Corporation a bond in such sum and in such form as it may direct or
to otherwise indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made
against it on account of the alleged loss, theft, mutilation or destruction
of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or
uncertificated shares. Proper evidence of such loss, theft, mutilation or
destruction shall be procured for the Board of Directors, if required. The
Board of Directors, in its discretion, may authorize the issuance of such new
certificate or uncertificated shares without any bond when in its judgment it
is proper to do so.

 

Section 7. _Record Date_.

 

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board
of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
of Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law,
not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of
such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also
be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such
record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be
the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which  the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any
adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors
may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote
at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date
for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an
earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote
in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

 

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted,
and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such
action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

(c) Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation, in order
that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten (10) days after
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors. If no record date for determining stockholders entitled to
express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting is fixed by
the Board of Directors, (i) when no prior action of the Board of Directors is
required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be the first date on
which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to
be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law,
and (ii) if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the
record date for such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on
which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

of such special meeting, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
in voting power of the stock entitled to vote thereon.

Section 2. _Amendments by the Board of Directors_. The Board of Directors may
adopt, amend or repeal these Bylaws by the affirmative vote of the Board of

Section 3. _Dividends; Reserves_.

 

(a) Subject to any restrictions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation,
the Board of Directors may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of the
Corporations capital stock from the Corporations surplus, or if there be
none, out of its net profits for the current fiscal year and/or the preceding
fiscal year. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property or in shares
of capital stock of the Corporation, subject to the provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully
paid shares, the Corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares
of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the
consideration actually paid thereon. Dividends shall be payable upon such
dates as the Board of Directors may designate.

 

(b) If the dividend is to be paid in shares of the theretofore unissued
capital stock of the Corporation, the Board of Directors shall,
by resolution, direct that there be designated as capital in respect of such
shares an amount which is not less than the aggregate par value of par value
shares being declared as a dividend and, in the case of shares without par
value being declared as a dividend, such amount as shall be determined by the
Board of Directors; provided, however, that no such designation as capital
shall be necessary if shares are being distributed by the Corporation pursuant
to a split-up or division of its stock. 

(c) The Board of Directors may set apart out of the funds of the Corporation
available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may
abolish any such reserve.

Section 4. _Corporate Seal_. The Board of Directors may adopt a corporate
seal. The corporate seal shall consist of a die bearing the name of the
corporation and the inscription, "Corporate Seal-Delaware." Said seal may be
used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or
reproduced or otherwise. 

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _Indemnification_

Section 1. _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party
or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was
a director or an officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of
the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the
basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
director, officer, employee, agent or trustee or in any other capacity  while serving as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee, shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent
permitted by Delaware law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended
(but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights
than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such
amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys
fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection
therewith; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 3 of this
Article VIII with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification
or advancement of expenses or with respect to any compulsory counterclaim
brought by such indemnitee, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board of Directors.

 

Section 2. _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. In addition to the right to
indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this Article VIII, an indemnitee
shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred in appearing at, participating in or
defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition or in
connection with a proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article VIII (which
shall be governed by Section 3 of this Article VIII) (hereinafter an
"advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, any advancement of
expenses hereunder in connection with any such proceeding shall be made solely
upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an
"undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified in connection with such proceeding.

 

Section 3. _Enforcement_. If a claim under Section 1 or Section 2 of this
Article VIII is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days
after a written claim for indemnification has been received by the
Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in
which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may
at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the
unpaid amount of the claim or to obtain advancement of expenses, as
applicable. To the fullest extent permitted by law, if successful in whole or
in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or
defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a
defense that, and (ii) any suit brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final
adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of
such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of
the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties
to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or
its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the
indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee
to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses
hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that
the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of
expenses, under this Article VIII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation. Section 4. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by
this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person
may have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The
Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with
any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting
indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the
DGCL, or by any other applicable law.

Section 5. _Survival of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by this
Article VIII shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or
executive officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.

Section 6. _Insurance_. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, or any
other applicable law, the Corporation, upon approval by the Board of
Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or
permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Article VIII.

 

Section 7. _Amendments_. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article
VIII that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or his or her
successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such
right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged
occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such
amendment or repeal.

Section 8. _Saving Clause_. If this Article VIII or any portion hereof shall
be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer
to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Article
VIII that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. If
this Article VIII shall be invalid due to the application of the
indemnification provisions of another jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall
indemnify each director and executive officer to the full extent under any
other applicable law.

Section 9. _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this
Article VIII shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or trustee and shall inure
to the benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators. Any
amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VIII that adversely affects
any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and
shall not limit, eliminate, or impair any such right with respect to any
proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or
omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.
