calculation in reasonable detail.

 

(iii) If the Equityholders Representative does not deliver a Dispute Notice
to the Surviving Corporation prior to the expiration of the Review Period,

were timely disputed in the Dispute Notice. Except to the extent set forth in
a Dispute Notice timely delivered, the Surviving Corporations calculation of
Closing Working Capital, Closing Debt and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses
set forth in the Closing Date Schedule shall be deemed final and binding on
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, 

 



24  the Equityholders Representative and the Equityholders in all other
respects for all purposes of this Agreement. If the Equityholders
Representative and the Surviving Corporation are unable to reach agreement on
disputed portions of Closing Working Capital, Closing Debt and Unpaid Company

workpapers to KPMG, or such other nationally recognized independent accounting
firm that is mutually agreed upon by the Surviving Corporation and the
Equityholders Representative (such firm, or any successor thereto, being
referred to herein as the " _Accounting Firm_ ") after such thirtieth (30th)
day. In connection with the resolution of any such dispute by the Accounting
Firm: (i) each of the Surviving Corporation and the Equityholders
Representative shall have a reasonable opportunity to make written

the Accounting Firm to provide its views as to any disputed issues with
respect to the calculation of any of Closing Working Capital, Closing Debt
and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses; (ii) each of the Surviving

Firm shall determine Closing Working Capital, Closing Debt and Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses in accordance with the terms of this Agreement within

and (iv) the determination made by the Accounting Firm of Closing Working
Capital, Closing Debt and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses shall be final
and binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Equityholders
Representative and the Equityholders for all purposes of this Agreement,
absent manifest error. In calculating Closing Working Capital, Closing Debt
and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, (x) the Accounting Firm shall be
limited to addressing any particular disputes referred to in the Dispute
Notice and (y) each such amount shall be no greater than the higher
corresponding amount calculated by the Equityholders Representative and the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and no lower than the lower
corresponding amount calculated by the Equityholders Representative and the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be. The Expert Calculations shall
reflect in detail the differences, if any, between Closing Working Capital,
Closing Debt and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses reflected therein and
Closing Working Capital, Closing Debt and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses
set forth in the Closing Date Schedule. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation and the
Equityholders Representative in proportion to how close each partys position
was to the determination of the Accounting Firm (it being understood that any
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm payable by the Equityholders
Representative shall be reimbursed pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_). All
negotiations pursuant to this _Section 2.8 _shall be treated as compromise
and settlement negotiations for the purposes of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules
of Evidence and comparable state rules of evidence, and all submissions to the
Accounting Firm shall be treated as confidential information. 

(d) _Payment Upon Final Determination of Adjustments_.

 

(i) If (A) the difference of Closing Working Capital, _less_ Closing Debt and
Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 2.8(c)_, is less than (B) the difference of Estimated Working
Capital, _less_ Estimated

 



25  Closing Debt and Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, as finally
estimated in accordance with _Section 2.8(a)_, then the Equityholders
Representative shall pay the amount of such deficiency to the Surviving
Corporation solely from the Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Surviving Corporations sole recourse for
payment of any such deficiency pursuant to this  _Section 2.8(d)(i) _shall
be the Escrow Fund and neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates shall have any claim against any Equityholder in
respect thereof.

 

(ii) If (A) the difference of Closing Working Capital, _less_ Closing Debt and
Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 2.8(c)_, _less_ (B) the difference of Estimated Working Capital,
_less_ Estimated Closing Debt and Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses, as finally estimated in accordance with  _Section 2.8(a)_, is
greater than zero, then the Surviving Corporation shall, no later than one
Business Day after such determination (or, if such Equityholder is a holder of
Company Common Stock and has not exchanged such Equityholders Certificates
pursuant to _Article III_, then upon such exchange by such Equityholder),
cause to be paid to each Equityholder by delivery of immediately available
funds to such Equityholder an amount equal to the product of such excess
multiplied by such Equityholders Applicable Percentage.

SECTION 2.9 _Earn-Out Amount_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, within sixty
(60) days following the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent
shall pay to the Earn-Out Equityholders, as consideration for their Company
Common Stock, the final Earn-Out Amount. The final Earn-Out Amount shall be
allocated to each Earn-Out Equityholder based on a ratio, the numerator of

of which is the aggregate of all Earn-Out Equityholders Applicable
Percentages.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _EBITDA_ " means earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. EBITDA will be determined in
accordance with GAAP and Parents standard accounting methodology and
procedures, consistently applied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is
any conflict between Parents standard accounting methodology and practices
and the terms of this Agreement, then solely for purposes of calculating the
Earn-Out Amount hereunder, the terms of this Agreement will govern. For
clarity, the definition of EBITDA under this Agreement shall be used solely
for purposes of determining the Earn-Out Amount hereunder and the aggregate
awarded shares of Parents common stock to the Management Equityholders under
their respective Performance Stock Agreements, and not to determine the
financial performance of the Group Companies for any other purpose.

bill Commissions and Contingent Revenues are recognized when received (i.e.,

(B) For agency bill policies for which premiums are paid in installments
during the policy period, such Commissions are recognized on the later of the
payment due date for each installment (as indicated in the policy) or the
date each installment was billed to the Client (as indicated in the invoice
for each installment), _provided_ , however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, during the Earn-Out Period:

 

(1) With respect to the Group Companies personal auto, residential property,
and residential earthquake programs, for agency bill policies for which

(F) Any revenues recognized during the three (3)-year period beginning
February 1, 2012, and ending January 31, 2015 (the " _Earn-Out Period_ ")
under GAAP to reflect any changes in the fair value of the Earn-Out Amount;

 

(G) Any benefits paid to Parent under any Management Equityholder Life Policy
purchased by Parent; and

 

(H) Any purchase price or other consideration that Parent or any Group Company

Client Account (" _Premiums/Fees Receivable_ ") are written off as bad debt in
accordance with Parents accounts receivable collection policy, as the same
may be modified on a company-wide basis from time to time, during the Earn-Out
Period, any corresponding Commissions or Service Fees that were previously
recognized as revenue during the Earn-Out Period, and not otherwise reduced
(e.g., by cancellation credits), will be excluded dollar-for-dollar from
revenues; provided, however, that if such Premiums/Fees Receivable are later
collected during the Earn-Out Period, any corresponding Commissions
or Services Fees will be included in revenues. No Commissions or Service Fees
corresponding to Premiums/Fees Receivable that were written-off as
uncollectible bad debt before the Effective Time and are later collected
during the Earn-Out Period will be included in revenues.

(iv) In calculating revenues, earned Commissions will be reduced for any
cancellations or non-renewals effective during the Earn-Out Period, or
recorded or received between the end of the Earn-Out Period and the
calculation and payment of the final Earn-Out Amount, for any policies placed

(v) EBITDA will reflect all expenses actually incurred by the Group Companies
and the following corporate expenses charged by Parent to its profit centers:

charge to Parents other profit centers, for Parents premium and deductible

to any claim arising on or after the Closing Date against any Group Company,
net of any applicable insurance proceeds actually paid (any applicable
deductibles, judgment or settlement amount, and all related legal fees, costs
and expenses for any Action pending as of, or any claim arising before, the
Closing Date, will be subject to Parents indemnity rights under _Article IX_
);

(viii) Charges for the total compensation expense (including direct
compensation and bonus compensation, group health plan and other Employee
Benefit Plan-related expenses, expense accruals for paid time off (PTO) for
applicable employees, and all compensation-related Tax-related liabilities)
for all employees of the Group Companies, _provided_ that as to new hires
whose direct compensation qualifies for subsidization under Parents corporate
assistance program, such subsidized direct compensation will not be included
within Expenses. For the second twelve (12)-month period (" _Year Two_ ") and
third twelve (12)-month period (" _Year Three_ ") of the Earn-Out Period, the
direct compensation expense charge may, subject to Parents prior written
approval, include an increase of up to three and one-half percent (3.5%) of
the total direct compensation expense of New Profit Center employees, other
than Management Equityholders, over the prior twelve (12)-month period (such
increase, the " _Salary Increase Pool_ "). The Salary Increase Pool, if any,
will be distributed in Year Two and Year Three as annual salary increases
among New Profit Center employees other than Management Equityholders in such
amounts as the New Profit Center Leader may determine in his or her
discretion.

(ix) Expenses will also include charges for depreciation, in accordance with
Parents standard accounting methodology and practices, for computers,
furniture and other tangible personal property acquired by the Group Companies
on or after the Effective Time in excess of $750,000.00 per year, unless
otherwise approved by Parent; and

(x) Expenses for optional marketing materials, programs, and services offered
by Parent that any Group Company orders or in which any Group Company elects
to participate.

(xi) The following are excluded from "Expenses":

(A) Any acquisition amortization expense related to the Merger;

 



29 (B) Parents income tax expense;

 

(C) Parents cost of capital;

(D) Any premium expense incurred by Parent in connection with the purchase of
any Management Equityholder Life Policy;

(E) Any expenses recognized during the Earn-Out Period under GAAP to reflect
any changes in the fair value of the Earn-Out Amount; and

 

(F) Any expenses associated with compliance with (w) Parents quality control
guidelines; (x) Parents accounting methodology, procedures, guidelines, and
internal controls; (y) the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and other
applicable Law; and (z) any necessary information technology (IT) upgrades as
required by Parent.

 

(f) _Management of New Profit Center During Earn-Out Period_. For a period
extending at least for the Earn-Out Period:

 

(i) The Group Companies will be collectively operated as a new profit center
of Parent (the " _New Profit Center_ ") and shall be managed by a profit
center leader (the _"New Profit Center Leader_ "). Chris L. Walker will serve
as the New Profit Center Leader during the Earn-Out Period, unless otherwise
agreed between Mr. Walker and Parent or Mr. Walkers employment with Parent
or the Group Companies terminates for any reason before the end of the Earn-
Out Period.

(ii) The management of the New Profit Center will be generally consistent with
the past business practices and corporate policies of the Group Companies,
subject to compliance with: Parents quality control guidelines; Parents
accounting methodology, procedures, guidelines, and internal controls; the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and other applicable Law; any
necessary information technology (IT) upgrades as required by Parent; and
generally the requirement to manage the New Profit Center for the long-term
benefit of Parent and Parents shareholders.

(iii) The New Profit Center Leader may not make any managerial decision,
including any decision to minimize the New Profit Centers expenses in the
Earn-Out Period (including by implementing material staff reductions that are
not dictated by a corresponding reduction in business or, in individual cases
and with Parents reasonable prior written approval, by a legitimate business
reason, unrelated to the determination of whether the maximum Earn-Out Amount
will be achieved), for the primary purpose of maximizing EBITDA and the Earn-
Out Amount. Conversely, Parent may not take any action, including any action
to increase the New Profit Centers expenses during the Earn-Out Period, for
the primary purpose of minimizing EBITDA.

(g) _Acquisitions or Transfers During Earn-Out Period __._  

(i) During the Earn-Out Period, no acquisitions by Parent or the New Profit
Center will be merged into the New Profit Center unless mutually agreed by
the parties. Any mutually agreed Fold-In Acquisitions will be treated in
accordance with _Section 2.10_.

 



30 (ii) If Parent elects to sell, transfer, assign, or remove (" _Transfer_
") any Client Accounts of the New Profit Center during the Earn-Out Period,
an amount equal to (1) the core Commissions and Service Fees earned by the
Group Companies during the twelve (12)-month period immediately preceding the
effective date of such Transfer, _less_ any such Commissions or Service Fees
that the Group Companies have already recognized before the effective date of
the Transfer (" _Net Core Revenue_ "), _times_ (2) the EBITDA Margin, will
be credited for purposes of calculating EBITDA for Year Three. The term "
_EBITDA Margin_ " means the quotient of EBITDA earned by the Group Companies
during the twelve (12)-month period immediately preceding the effective date
of such Transfer, _divided by_ Net Core Revenue.

(h) _Calculation_. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than sixty (60) days following the end of Year Three, the Surviving
Corporation shall, at its expense, (i) cause to be prepared a statement (the "
_Earn-Out Amount Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the
Surviving Corporations calculation of EBITDA for Year Three and the final
Earn-Out Amount, giving effect to any Fold-In Acquisitions consummated during
the Earn-Out Period in accordance with _Section 2.10_, and (ii) deliver to
Chris L. Walker, as representative for the Earn-Out Equityholders, the Earn-
Out Amount Statement. For purposes of this subsection (h), references to
"Chris L. Walker" shall include any Earn-Out Equityholder that replaces or
succeeds Chris L. Walker as the Earn-Out Equityholders representative under
this subsection (h).

(i) During Year Three, the Surviving Corporation shall provide Chris L.
Walker and any accountants or advisors retained by Chris L. Walker with full
access to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation for the purposes
of: (A) enabling Chris L. Walker and the retained accountants and advisors to
calculate, and to review the Surviving Corporations calculation of, EBITDA
and the Earn-Out Amount; and (B) identifying any dispute related to the
calculation of EBITDA or the Earn-Out Amount in the Earn-Out Amount
Statement. The reasonable fees and expenses of any such accountants and
advisors retained by Chris L. Walker shall be paid by the Earn-Out
Equityholders and not Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

 

(ii) If Chris L. Walker disputes the calculation of EBITDA or the Earn-Out
Amount set forth in the Earn-Out Amount Statement, then Chris L. Walker shall
deliver a written notice (an " _Earn-Out Amount Dispute Notice_ ") to the
Surviving Corporation at any time during the sixty (60) day period commencing
upon receipt by Chris L. Walker of the Earn-Out Amount Statement (subject to
extension for any period of inadequate access to the underlying records) (the
" _Earn-Out Amount Review Period_ "). The Earn-Out Amount Dispute Notice shall
set forth the basis for the dispute of any such calculation in reasonable
detail.

(iii) If Chris L. Walker does not deliver an Earn-Out Amount Dispute Notice to
the Surviving Corporation prior to the expiration of the Earn-Out Amount
Review Period, the Surviving Corporations calculation of EBITDA and the Earn-
Out Amount set forth in the Earn-Out Amount Statement shall be deemed final
and binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Chris L. Walker and the
Earn-Out Equityholders for all purposes of this Agreement.

(iv) If Chris L. Walker delivers an Earn-Out Amount Dispute Notice to the
Surviving Corporation prior to the expiration of the Earn-Out Amount Review
Period, then

 



31  Chris L. Walker and the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the portions of the EBITDA and Earn-
Out Amount calculation which were timely disputed in the Earn-Out Amount
Dispute Notice. Except to the extent set forth in an Earn-Out Amount Dispute
Notice timely delivered, the Surviving Corporations calculation of EBITDA and
the Earn-Out Amount set forth in the Earn-Out Amount Statement shall be
deemed final and binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Chris L. Walker
and the Earn-Out Equityholders in all other respects for all purposes of this
Agreement. If Chris L. Walker and the Surviving Corporation are unable to
reach agreement on disputed portions of the EBITDA and/or the Earn-Out Amount
calculations set forth in the Earn-Out Amount Statement within thirty (30)
days after the end of the Earn-Out Amount Review Period, the parties shall
refer such dispute and submit their related workpapers to the Accounting Firm
after such 30th day. In connection with the resolution of any such dispute by
the Accounting Firm: (A) each of the Surviving Corporation and Chris L. Walker
shall have a reasonable opportunity to make written submissions in support of
its position to the Accounting Firm, and meet with the Accounting Firm to
provide its views as to any disputed issues with respect to the calculation of
EBITDA and/or the Earn-Out Amount; (B) each of the Surviving Corporation and
the Equityholders Representative shall promptly provide, or cause to be
provided, to the Accounting Firm all information, and to make available to the
Accounting Firm its personnel, as are reasonably necessary to permit the
Accounting Firm to resolve such disputes; (C) the Accounting Firm shall
determine EBITDA and the Earn-Out Amount in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement within thirty (30) days of such referral and upon reaching such
determination shall deliver a copy of its calculations (the " _Earn-Out Amount
Expert Calculations_ ") to Chris L. Walker and Surviving Corporation Agent;
and (D) the determination made by the Accounting Firm of EBITDA and the Earn-
Out Amount shall be final and binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
Chris L. Walker and the Earn-Out Equityholders for all purposes of this
Agreement, absent manifest error. In calculating EBITDA and the Earn-Out
Amount, (x) the Accounting Firm shall be limited to addressing any particular
disputes referred to in the Earn-Out Amount Dispute Notice and (y) each such
amount shall be no greater than the higher corresponding amount calculated by
Chris L. Walker and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and no
lower than the lower corresponding amount calculated by Chris L. Walker and
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be. The Earn-Out Amount Expert
Calculations shall reflect in detail the differences, if any, between EBITDA
and the Earn-Out Amount reflected therein and EBITDA and the Earn-Out Amount
set forth in the Earn-Out Amount Statement. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation and Chris L.
Walker in proportion to how close each partys position was to the
determination of the Accounting Firm. All negotiations pursuant to this
subsection (g) shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for
the purposes of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and comparable state
rules of evidence, and all submissions to the Accounting Firm shall be treated
as confidential information.

 

(v) The Surviving Corporation shall, no later than one Business Day after the
final determination of EBITDA and the Earn-Out Amount in accordance with this
subsection (g) by delivery of immediately available funds to each Earn-Out
Equityholder, an amount equal to the product of the final Earn-Out Amount
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of
Company Common Stock held by such Earn-Out Equityholder as of the Closing
Date, and the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock held by all Earn-Out Equityholders as of the Closing Date.

 



32 SECTION 2.10 _Fold-In Acquisitions_.

 

(a) As used herein, the term:

(i) " _Fold-In Acquisition_ " means the acquisition by Parent or the Group
Companies of any insurance intermediary operation (A) which any Senior
Executive identifies and introduces to Parent during the Earn-Out Period as
an acquisition prospect, (B) which Parent, any Group Company, or any of their
Affiliates had not previously identified and contacted as an acquisition
prospect, (C) as to which any Senior Executive materially contributed to the
consummation of the acquisition during his or her employment with the Group
Companies after the Closing Date, and (D) which acquisition either (1)
combines with and into ("folds into") the New Profit Center or (2) operates
as a branch of the New Profit Center under the management of the New Profit
Center Leader. For avoidance of doubt, those insurance intermediary
organizations set forth in _Schedule 2.10(a)(i)_ shall be considered Fold-In
Acquisitions _provided_ the conditions set forth in clauses (B), (C), and (D)
above are otherwise satisfied and Parents or any Group Companys acquisition
of such organization is completed during the Earn-Out Period. 

(ii) " _Fold-In Acquisitions Cost of Capital Charge_ " means the sum of:

 

(A) Six percent (6%) of the aggregate purchase price paid or payable by

(A) one hundred percent (100%) of the quotient of (1) the aggregate purchase
price paid or payable by Parent, the applicable Group Company, or the
applicable Affiliate thereof, as the case may be, on any Fold-In Acquisitions
completed during the first or second year of the Earn-Out Period, _divided by_
(2) fifteen (15), plus

 

(B) sixty-seven percent (67%) of the quotient of (1) the aggregate purchase
price paid or payable by Parent, the applicable Group Company, or the
applicable Affiliate thereof, as the case may be, on any completed Fold-In
Acquisitions during the third year of the Earn-Out Period, _divided by_ (2)
fifteen (15).

 

(iv) " _Fold-In Acquisitions Support Charge_ " means an aggregate charge for
Parents support services in investigating, negotiating, completing, and
integrating Fold-In Acquisitions, equal to thirty-three percent (33%) of the

such Fold-In Acquisition.

 

(b) During the Earn-Out Period, Parent shall permit the Senior Executives to
use commercially reasonable efforts to identify, meet with, and introduce
prospective Fold-In

 



33  Acquisition opportunities to Parent and the Group Companies, _provided_ that
such activities do not materially interfere with the satisfactory performance
the Senior Executives duties under their employment agreements with the
Group Companies or, without Parents prior written consent, require that any
business time be expended by any other employee of the Group Companies.

 

(c) Any Fold-In Acquisition shall be subject to Parents prior approval and
satisfactory due diligence investigation. Prior to the completion of any
acquisition that might reasonably meet the definition of a Fold-In
Acquisition, Parent and the New Profit Center Leader, shall mutually agree in
writing as to whether such acquisition shall be deemed a Fold-In Acquisition.
Fold-In Acquisitions that will physically combine operations into the New
Profit Centers offices and that are completed during the Earn-Out Period
shall fold into the New Profit Centers office as quickly as reasonably
possible, subject to the availability of sufficient office space, distance
from the New Profit Centers offices or other transactional issues that might
require the Fold-In Acquisition be a new stand-alone office.

 

(d) In determining Year Three EBITDA and the Earn-Out Amount under _Section
2.9_, for each Fold-In Acquisition:

 

(i) EBITDA shall include all EBITDA earned from such Fold-In Acquisition
during Year Three; and

 

(ii) The Fold-In Acquisitions Cost of Capital Charge, the Fold-In Acquisitions
Payments Amount, and the Fold-In Acquisitions Support Charge for such Fold-In
Acquisition shall be deducted dollar-for-dollar from the Earn-Out Amount;
_provided_ , that the Fold-In Acquisitions Support Charge shall only be
applied in the year the applicable Fold-In Acquisition is consummated. 

(e) Solely for illustrative purposes, _Exhibit G_ to this Agreement sets forth
examples of the effect of certain Fold-In Acquisitions on EBITDA; the Fold-In
Acquisitions Cost of Capital Charge, the Fold-In Acquisitions Payments Amount,
and the Fold-In Acquisitions Support Charge for such Fold-In Acquisitions; and
the resulting effect on the Earn-Out Amount. In the event of a conflict
between _Exhibit G_ and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this
Agreement shall control and govern.

SECTION 2.11 _Withholding Rights_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Equityholder any amounts which are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, including the types of
withholding disclosed on _Schedule 2.11_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a)
before making any such deduction or withholding, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall give the Equityholders Representative
notice of the intention to make such deduction or withholding (such notice,
which shall include the authority, basis and method of calculation for the
proposed deduction or withholding, shall be given at least a commercially
reasonable period of time before such deduction or withholding is required,
in order for the Equityholders Representative to obtain reduction of or
relief from such deduction or withholding), (b) Parent or the Surviving

appropriate Governmental Authority any and all amounts so deducted or withheld
and timely file all Tax Returns and provide to the Equityholders
Representative such information statements and other documents required to be
filed or provided under applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the foregoing, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Equityholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

of Company Common Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided for in this Agreement.

 



37 ARTICLE IV.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company to Parent and Merger Sub, the Company shall deliver to Parent and
Merger Sub a confidential disclosure schedule (the " _Company Disclosure

to carry on its Business and (iii) is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each of the jurisdictions in which the ownership, operation
or leasing of its properties and assets and the conduct of its business
requires it to be so qualified, licensed or authorized, except where the
failure to have such power and authority, to be in good standing or to be duly
qualified to conduct business, would not result in a material monetary cost
to the Group Companies or a forfeiture of material rights by the Group
Companies. The Organizational Documents of the Group Companies, as amended to
date, copies of which have been delivered to Parent for review prior to
Closing, are true, complete, and correct in all material respects.

necessary corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the

it is a party. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
each of the other Transaction Agreements to which the Company or the
Equityholders Representative is a party by each of the Company and the
Equityholders Representative, as applicable, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein and therein have been duly and validly

Equityholders Representative is a party have been duly executed and delivered
by the Company and the Equityholders Representative, as applicable, and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties to
this Agreement) constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the
Company and the Equityholders Representative, as applicable, enforceable
against the Company and the Equityholders Representative, as applicable, in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar

of any of the Companys capital stock necessary to approve this Agreement and
the Merger.

SECTION 4.3 _No Conflict; Government Authorizations_.

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, does not
and will not, directly or indirectly, (i) conflict with, or result in any
violation of the Organizational Documents of the Company; (ii) subject to the
matters described in _Section 4.3(b)_, conflict with or result in a

Order or Law applicable to any Group Company, or any of their property or
assets; or (iii) except as set forth in _Section 4.3(a)_ of the Company

officers, employees, agents or representatives, during any
investigation conducted pursuant to _Section 6.2_, or in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or otherwise, shall be governed
by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) Except as required by applicable Law, legal or administrative process, or
stock exchange listing requirements, and only after compliance with _Section

legal or administrative process, or stock exchange listing requirements,
to disclose the terms of this Agreement, such party will notify the other
party promptly in writing of such request or requirement and the reason for
such request or requirement, so that the other party may seek a protective
order or other appropriate remedy or, in its sole discretion, waive
compliance with the terms of _Section 6.3(b)_. If no such protective order or
other remedy is obtained, or that the other party does not waive compliance
with _Section 6.3(b)_, such party will furnish only that portion of this

Law or otherwise to promptly consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) obtain all authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals of, and give all notices to and make all filings with,
all Governmental Authorities and other third parties that may be or become

no party shall be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur an
obligation in favor of) any Person from whom such authorization, consent,
order or approval may be required other than required filing fees). Each party
to this Agreement shall cooperate with the other parties to this Agreement in
promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals, giving such notices and making such filings.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the terms of _Section 6.4(a)_, to
the extent required by applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company shall
file, or cause to be filed, a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the

and which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate. No party shall
independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any substantive
conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect to any such
filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior
notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. The parties
will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party in connection with
proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or other antitrust laws. Each
party shall (A) give the other party prompt notice of the commencement or
threat of commencement of any Action by or before any Governmental Authority
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) keep the
other party informed as to the status of any such Action or threat, and (C)
promptly inform the other party of any communication to or from any
Governmental Authority regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

 



59 SECTION 6.5 _Further Action_. Subject to the terms and conditions provided in
this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver, or cause to be delivered, such
further certificates, instruments and other documents, and to take, or cause
to be taken, such further actions, as may be necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of the Group Companies
(collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against any and all
Damages incurred or suffered by any of the Company Indemnified Parties in
connection with any Liabilities or any Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
that any Group Company would have been permitted under applicable Law and
under the Organizational Documents of any Group Company, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, to indemnify such Company Indemnified
Parties and (ii) advance expenses as incurred by any Company Indemnified Party
in connection with any matters for which such Company Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification from Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.6(a)_ to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law or, if greater, under the
Organizational Documents of any Group Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides a
written agreement to repay such advances if it is ultimately and finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and all rights of appeal have
lapsed that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification
under applicable Law, the Organizational Documents of any Group Company, and
pursuant to this _Section 6.6(a)_.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less
favorable in all material respects with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Company Indemnified Parties
then are currently set forth in the Organizational Documents of any Group
Company. Any indemnification agreements with the Company Indemnified Parties
in existence on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, without any further action, and shall survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation for itself to maintain, in
effect a directors and officers liability insurance policy covering those
persons who are currently covered by the directors and officers liability
insurance policies of the Group Companies (copies of which have been
heretofore delivered by the Company to Parent and its agents and
representatives) with coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable as
the Companys existing coverage; 

 



60   _provided_ , that this _Section 6.6(c)_ shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if a prepaid policy or policies (i.e., "tail coverage") have been
obtained by the Company at the Companys expense (to be treated as an Unpaid
Company Transaction Expense hereunder), which policy or policies provide such
directors and officers with the coverage described in this _Section 6.6(c)_
for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing Date,
including with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
premiums for such prepaid policies shall be paid in full at or prior to the
Effective Time and such prepaid policies shall be non-cancelable. If such
prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full
force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any of its
successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving
corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

(e) The terms and provisions of this  _Section 6.6_ are intended to be in
addition to the rights otherwise available to the Company Indemnified Parties
by applicable Law, Organizational Documents or Contract, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and representatives, each of whom is an intended
third party beneficiary of this _Section 6.6_. The obligations under this
_Section 6.6_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
affect adversely any Company Indemnified Party without the consent of such
affected Company Indemnified Party.

SECTION 6.7 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant under any benefit
plan or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, Company Employees as of the Effective Time shall
receive service credit for service with the Group Companies to the same extent
such service credit was granted under the Company Benefit Plans, subject to
offsets for previously accrued benefits and no duplication of
benefits. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) to the extent permissible under the terms and
conditions of Parents welfare benefit plans (provided Parent shall not be
required to amend or modify any such welfare benefit plans) cause to be
waived all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Company Employees under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may
be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations
or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees
and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare
benefit plan maintained for the Company Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) to the extent permissible under the terms and
conditions of Parents welfare benefit plans (provided Parent shall not be
required to amend or modify any such welfare benefit plans) cause each
Company Employee to be provided with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans (other than
a Company Benefit Plan) that such employees are eligible to participate in
after the Effective Time.

 



61 (b) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, Parent shall have the right to
terminate employees and modify or terminate employee working conditions,
including employee benefits, following the Closing.

(c)  _Section 280G_.

(i) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
deliver to Parent, prior to the solicitation of the requisite stockholder
approval described in _Section 6.7(c)(ii)_ a Section 280G Waiver from each
Person who is a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (" _Section 280G_ ")),
as determined immediately prior to the initiation of the solicitation of the
requisite stockholder approval as described in _Section 6.7(c)(ii)_, related
to certain payments or benefits to be received by such Person in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent that such
payments or benefits, unless the requisite stockholder approval of such
parachute payments is obtained pursuant to _Section 6.7(c)(ii)_, would not
be deductible by the Companies under Section 280G.

(ii) As soon as practicable following the delivery by the Company to Parent
of the Section 280G Waiver, the Company shall submit to its stockholders for
approval in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code any payments
and/or benefits that are subject to a Section 280G Waiver, such that such
payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" under
Section 280G, and prior to the Effective Time Parent shall deliver to Parent
any written consents related to the shareholder approval of any payments
and/or benefits that are subject to a Section 280G Waiver.

(iii) The form of the Section 280G Waiver and any materials to be submitted
to the Companys stockholders in connection with seeking the requisite
stockholder approval (the " _Section 280G Soliciting Materials_ ") shall be
subject to reasonable review and approval by Parent. The Company will
promptly advise Parent in writing if, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
to the Companys Knowledge, any facts exists that might make it necessary or
appropriate to amend or supplement the Section 280G Soliciting Materials in
order to make statements contained or incorporated by reference therein not
misleading or to comply with applicable Law.

 

(d) The terms and provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and
nothing in this _Section 6.7_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon
any other person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee)
any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever, as a third-party beneficiary
of this Agreement or otherwise, under or by reason of this _Section 6.7_.

SECTION 6.8  _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. Each of the parties
to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Latham
and Watkins LLP may serve as counsel to

 



62  each and any holder of Company Common Stock or capital stock of the
Companys Subsidiaries, and each of their respective Affiliates (individually
and collectively, the " _Holder Group_ "), on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, Latham and Watkins LLP (or any successor) may serve as
counsel to the Holder Group or any director, member, partner, officer,
employee or Affiliate of the Holder Group, in connection with any litigation,
claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such
representation and each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and
waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties
shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest
arising from such representation.

SECTION 6.9 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Preparation of Tax Returns_. 

(i) The Equityholders Representative will prepare or cause to be prepared all
Tax Returns for the Group Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods which are
filed after the Closing Date. No later than twenty (20) days prior to filing,
the Equityholders Representative will deliver or cause to be delivered to
Parent all such Tax Returns and any related work papers and will permit
Parent to review and comment on each such Tax Return and will make such
revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Parent unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent shall timely file or cause to
be timely filed each such Tax Return and timely pay or cause to be timely
paid the amount of any Taxes shown due thereon to the appropriate Taxing
Authorities; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Equityholders Representative
shall reimburse Parent or the applicable Group Company for the amount of such
Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were not included as a liability in the
calculation of Closing Working Capital, no later than thirty (30) days after
the filing of the applicable Tax Return.

(ii) To the extent that any Tax Returns of the Group Companies relate to any
Straddle Periods, Parent will prepare or cause to be prepared in a manner
consistent with the prior Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries
unless otherwise required by applicable Law and file or cause to be filed any
such Tax Returns. Parent will permit the Equityholders Representative to
review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence
at least twenty (20) days prior to filing such Tax Returns and will make such
revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by
the Equityholders Representative unless otherwise required by applicable
Law. Parent will timely pay or cause to be timely paid the amount of any Taxes
shown as due on such Tax Returns to the appropriate Taxing Authorities;
provided, however, that the Equityholders Representative shall reimburse
Parent or the applicable Group Company for the portion of such Taxes which
relates to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, to
the extent such Taxes were not included as a liability in the calculation of
Closing Working Capital,, no later than thirty (30) days after the filing of
the applicable Tax Return. For purposes of this clause (ii) and other relevant
provisions of this Agreement (including  _Article IX_ ), in the case of any
Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle
Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date will (A) in the case of any Taxes other
than

 



63  Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction (1)
the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date and (2) the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and (B) in the case of any Tax
based upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing
Date. Any credits relating to a Straddle Period will be taken into account as
though the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date.
All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations will
be made in a manner consistent with GAAP and the prior practice of the Group
Companies unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

(iii) Subject to _Section 6.9(e)_, Parent shall not amend (or cause to be
amended) any Tax Return of any Group Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or, to the extent it would affect any Pre-Closing Taxes, any Straddle Period,
or make (or cause to be made) any Tax election that has retroactive effect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or, to the extent it would affect any Pre-Closing
Taxes, any Straddle Period, in each case without the prior written consent of
the Equityholders Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

 

(b) _Cooperation_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Equityholders
Representative shall reasonably cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this Agreement, any Tax Contest, and complying with the provisions
of _Section 6.9(e)_. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Contest and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder.

(c) _Contest Provisions_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each party
hereto will, at its own expense, control any Tax Contest for any taxable
period for which that party is charged with payment or indemnification
responsibility under this Agreement. In the case of any Tax Contest relating
to a Straddle Period (to the extent such Tax Contest relates to or would
affect Post-Closing Taxes) or Post-Closing Tax Period, Parent will control
such Tax Contest and will consult in good faith with the Equityholders
Representative as to the conduct of such Tax Contest. In no event will the
Equityholders Representative settle any Tax Contest relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or, to the extent such settlement would affect Post-Closing
Taxes, any Tax Contest relating to any Straddle Period, in a manner which
would adversely affect Parent, without the prior written consent of Parent,
which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In no
event will Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries settle
any Tax Contest relating to any Post-Closing Tax Period or, to the extent
such settlement would affect Pre-Closing Taxes, any Tax Contest relating to
any Straddle Period, in a manner which would adversely affect any
Equityholder, without the prior written consent of the
Equityholders Representative, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



64 (ii) Each party hereto will, at the expense of the requesting party, execute
or cause to be executed any IRS Form 2848 power of attorney or other
documents reasonably requested by such requesting party to enable it to take
any and all actions such party reasonably requests with respect to any Tax
Contest that the requesting party controls. 

(iii) Each party hereto will promptly forward to the other party all written
notifications and other written communications, including if available the
original envelope showing any postmark, from any Taxing Authority received by
such party relating to any liability for Taxes for any taxable period for
which a party is charged with payment or indemnification responsibility under
this Agreement and each indemnifying party will promptly notify, and consult
with, each indemnified party as to any action it proposes to take with respect
to any liability for Taxes for which it is required to indemnify
another party, and will not enter into any closing agreement or final
settlement with any Taxing Authority with respect to any such liability
without the written consent of the indemnified parties, which consent may not
be unreasonably withheld. The failure by a party to provide timely notice
under this subsection will not relieve the other party from its
indemnification obligations under this Agreement with respect to the subject
matter of any notification not timely forwarded, except to the extent the
other party is actually harmed thereby.

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes shall be borne by the Company (which
Transfer Taxes shall be accrued as a liability on the Closing Balance Sheet)
and, to the extent of any excess over such accrual, the Equityholders.
_Schedule 6.9(d)_ sets forth the Companys good faith estimate of all
applicable Transfer Taxes. The Equityholders Representative hereby agrees to
file in a timely manner, at its own expense, all necessary documents
(including, but not limited to, all Tax Returns) with respect to all such
amounts for which the Equityholders are so liable.

(e) _Transaction Tax Benefits_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the parties agree that:

(i) The Transaction Tax Benefit Items shall be reported on applicable Income
Tax Returns solely as Income Tax deductions of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or their Subsidiaries, as applicable, for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
and shall not be treated or reported as Income Tax deductions for a Post-
Closing Tax Period (including under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or any comparable or similar provision under state or
local Law), unless otherwise required by applicable Law. In connection with
the foregoing, unless otherwise requested by the
Equityholders Representative, Parent shall cause the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to make an election under Revenue
Procedure 2011-29, 2011-18 IRB 746, to treat seventy percent (70%) of any
success-based fees that were paid by or on behalf of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, and that were included in the Transaction Tax Benefit
Schedule, as an amount that did not facilitate the Merger and therefore as
deductible in a Pre-Closing Tax Period for U.S. federal income Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

(ii) To the extent that any Group Company has paid estimated Income Taxes for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period and the amount of the estimated Income Taxes that
were paid with respect to such Tax period exceeds the amount of the estimated
Income Tax liability

 



65  with respect to such Tax period (taking into account the Transaction Tax
Benefit Items), the Equityholders Representative shall prepare or cause to be
prepared IRS Form 4466 (Corporation Application for Quick Refund of
Overpayment of Estimated Tax) with any other IRS forms as may be reasonably
necessary (including IRS Form 8302 (Electronic Deposit of Tax Refund of $1
Million or More)) and any analogous application for a state refund of an
overpayment of estimated state Income Taxes with respect to such Tax period.
Any such refund application shall be treated as an Income Tax Return that is
subject to analogous review, comment and filing procedures to those set forth
in  _Section 6.9(a)(i)_. Within fifteen (15) Business Days of the receipt
from the applicable Taxing Authority of a refund as a result of such a refund
application, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid an amount equal to such
refund to accounts designated by the Equityholders Representative for
distribution to the Equityholders.

(iii) To the extent that the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries (or any of their successors) has a net operating loss that
is attributable to the deduction of Transaction Tax Benefit Items, the
Equityholders Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared any claim
for refund (including IRS Form 1139 or any successor form, and any comparable
state or local forms) or amended Tax Return to effect a carryback of such loss
(a " _TTB Carryback_ ") to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Any such
refund claim shall be treated as an Income Tax Return that is subject to
analogous review, comment and filing procedures to those set forth in _Section
6.9(a)(i)_. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, any TTB Carryback
shall be utilized to its fullest extent prior to the utilization of any
carryback of any Tax attribute of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Subsidiaries (or any of their successors) generated during a
Post-Closing Tax Period. Within fifteen (15) Business Days of the receipt from
the applicable Taxing Authority of a refund as a result of such a refund
claim, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid an amount equal to such refund
to accounts designated by the Equityholders Representative for distribution
to the Equityholders.

(iv) To the extent that, after the application of _Section 6.9(e)(ii)_ and
_Section 6.9(e)(iii)_, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries (or any of their successors) has a net operating loss
carryforward that is attributable to the Transaction Tax Benefit Items (a "
_TTB Carryforward_ "), then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to accounts
designated by the Equityholders Representative for distribution to the
Equityholders an amount equal to the sum of (A) one hundred percent (100%) of
the amount by which (1) the amount of state Taxes that Parent, the Group
Companies, and Parents other subsidiaries (or any of their successors),
reporting as a combined group, would have been required to pay in the State
of California during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending
December 31, 2016, but for the TTB Carryforward, exceeds (2) the amount of
state Taxes actually payable in the State of California by Parent, the Group
Companies, and Parents other subsidiaries (or any of their successors),
reporting as a combined group, in such period, plus (B) fifty percent (50%) of
the amount by which (1) the amount of U.S. federal Taxes that Parent, the
Group Companies, and Parents other subsidiaries (or any of their successors),
reporting as a consolidated group, would have been required to pay during the
period beginning on the Closing Date and ending December 31, 2016, but for
the TTB Carryforward, exceeds (2) the amount of U.S. federal Taxes actually
payable by Parent, the Group Companies, and Parents other subsidiaries (or
any of their successors), reporting as a consolidated group, in such period;
_provided_ , however, that, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, such
amount shall be determined (x) by Parent in its reasonable discretion,
exercised in good faith, and (y) prior to taking into account any Tax 

 



66  attribute of Parent, the Group Companies, and Parents other subsidiaries
(or any of their successors) generated during the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending December 31, 2016. Parent shall make such payments,
or cause such payments to be made, within fifteen (15) Business Days of filing
the Tax Return for the Tax year(s) in which such TTB Carryforward is utilized.

 

(f) _Overlap Provisions_. In the event of any conflict or overlap between the
provisions of this _Section 6.9_ and  _Article IX_ , the provisions of this
_Section 6.9_ shall control.

SECTION 6.10 _Disclosure Schedules_ ; Supplementation and Amendment of
Schedules. From time to time prior to the Closing, the Company shall have the
right to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to
any matter hereafter arising or discovered after the delivery of the Company
Disclosure Schedule pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such supplements or amendments to the Company Disclosure Schedule shall have
no effect for the purposes of determining the satisfaction of any condition
to Closing set forth in _Article VII_. Such supplements or amendments to the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall also, for purposes of determining whether
the Company has breached any of its representations and warranties hereunder
for any purpose other than _Section 7.2(a)_, not be deemed to amend the
Company Disclosure Schedule hereto and the sections of the Company Disclosure
Schedule referenced in such supplement or amendment.

 

SECTION 6.11 Exclusivity. The Company agrees that after the date hereof until
the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, it shall not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the officers,
directors, managers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, agents, advisors, representatives and Affiliates of the Group
Companies not to, directly or indirectly: (a) solicit, initiate, or knowingly
facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal; (b)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any information with respect to, or take any other action knowingly to
facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or could be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; (c)
grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any class of the Companys or any Company Subsidiaries securities;
or (d) enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company agrees to promptly notify Parent upon receipt by the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this _Section 6.11_, " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " means any offer or proposal for, or indication of interest in, a
merger, consolidation, stock exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction which
involves any purchase of at least 51% of the assets of the Group Companies,
taken as a whole, or any capital stock of any Group Company, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.12 _Errors and Omissions and Employment Practices Liability Extended
Reporting ("Tail") Coverage_.

(a) On or before the Closing Date, the Company will arrange to purchase, at
the Companys expense (to be treated as an Unpaid Company Transaction Expense
hereunder), extended reporting period ("tail") coverage extensions for each
of the Companys professional

 



67  liability (EandO) insurance policy and employment practices liability (EPL)
insurance policy (each and collectively, the " _Required Tail Coverage_ ").
The Required Tail Coverage shall extend for a period of at least five (5)
years from the Effective Time, shall have the same limits and deductibles
currently in effect, and shall otherwise be in form reasonably acceptable to
Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the endorsement or
policy evidencing the Required Tail Coverage shall not contain an "other
insurance" or similar provision that purports to make the Required Tail
Coverage excess rather than primary and non-contributory coverage as to any
error or omission or EPL occurrence arising before later of the Closing Date
and the Effective Time (an " _Excess Coverage Provision_ "). If the Required
Tail Coverage is procured as an endorsement to the Companys existing EandO
insurance policy or EPL insurance policy, and the existing policy contains an
Excess Coverage Provision, the Required Tail Coverage endorsement shall amend
the existing policy to (i) remove the Excess Coverage Provision and (ii)
state expressly that the Required Tail Coverage shall be primary and non-
contributory as to any error or omission or EPL occurrence arising before the
Effective Time.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the parties intent that, subject to
the terms and conditions of _Article IX_ of this Agreement: (i) as between
the Required Tail Coverage and any coverage that might be available under
Parents policies, the Required Tail Coverage shall be primary and non-
contributory; (ii) Parent may seek indemnity from the Escrow Fund for any
deductibles or retentions under the Required Tail Coverage (" _Required Tail
Deductible_ ")to the extent permitted under _Article IX_.

(c) After the Closing, with respect to any Action that names or otherwise
involves any Company Group, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or their
Affiliates as to which defense and/or coverage may be available for the
Company Group, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or their Affiliates under the
Required Tail Coverage, Parent may, at its option and sole discretion,
directly pay any applicable Required Tail Deductible under the Required
Tail Coverage to the appropriate Carrier and seek indemnity for such Required
Tail Deductible pursuant to _Article IX_. Nothing in this _Section 6.12_
shall limit or affect the parties indemnity rights and obligations under 
_Article IX_.

SECTION 6.13 _Proration of January 2012 Income and Adjustment of Closing
Working Capital_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in the event the Merger closes in January 2012:

 

(a) January Income (as defined below) shall be multiplied by a fraction (the "
_Proration Factor_ "), the numerator of which is the number of days in the
period beginning on January 1, 2012, and ending on the Closing Date, and the
denominator of which is thirty-one (31). The product of January Income _times_
the Proration Factor shall be deemed the reportable income for January 2012
for the Group Companies prior to the Closing Date, and the balance of January
Income minus such product shall be deemed reportable income for January 2012
for the Group Companies on and after the Closing Date. The term " _January
Income_ " means (i) total revenues earned by the Group Companies during
calendar month January 2012, _minus_ (ii) total expenses ( _excluding_ Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses and interest expense) incurred by the Group
Companies during calendar month January 2012, as determined in accordance with
the Group Companies standard accounting practices and methodology applied on
a consistent basis.

 



68 (b) Closing Working Capital shall determined using Closing Working Capital as
of December 31, 2011, as adjusted by an amount equal to (i) the Proration
Factor _times_ (ii) the difference of (A) Closing Working Capital as of
January 31, 2012, _minus_ (B) Closing Working Capital as of December 31,
2011.

ARTICLE VII.

CONDITIONS TO CLOSING

waiver by the Company, at or prior to the Closing, of each of the following
conditions:

(a) _Representations and Warranties; Covenants_. (i) The representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Article V_ shall be true

covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement to be performed or

to the Closing only as follows:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;

(b) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, by written notice to the other party if any Governmental Authority
with jurisdiction over such matters shall have issued a Governmental Order
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such
Governmental Order shall have become final and unappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the terms of this  _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available

(c) by Parent and Merger Sub, if there shall have been a material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the Company or the

_Terminating Company Breach_ "), except that, if such Terminating Company

the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then, for a period of up to
thirty (30) days (the " _Company Cure Period_ "), such termination shall not
be effective, and such termination shall become effective only if the
Terminating Company Breach is not cured within the Company Cure Period;

 



70 (d) by the Company, if there shall have been a material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by Parent or Merger Sub set
forth in this Agreement, such that the conditions specified in _Section 7.1_
would not be satisfied at Closing (a " _Terminating Parent Breach_ "), except

SECTION 8.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 8.1_, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and of no further force or effect whatsoever and
there shall be no liability on the part of any party to this Agreement;

liability resulting from or arising out of any intentional, material breach of
any agreement or covenant hereunder; and _provided_ , _further_ , that

71 ARTICLE IX.

INDEMNIFICATION

SECTION 9.1 _Survival of Representations_ (a) The representations and
warranties made by the Company in _Article IV_ , on the one hand, and by
Parent and Merger Sub in _Article V_ , on the other hand, shall survive the
Closing and shall expire (i) eighteen (18) months after the Effective Time,
(ii) as to any such representations and warranties the breach of which is a
Special Matter, other than Tax related Special Matters and Escheat Matters,
three (3) years after the Effective Time; (ii) as to any Tax related Special
Matters, sixty (60) days following the expiration of all applicable statutes
of limitations; and (iv) as to any Escheat Matters, the first to occur of (A)
the written acknowledgment by the applicable Governmental Authority that the
liability associated with such Escheat Matters has been fully discharged and
(B) sixty days following the expiration of all applicable statutes of
limitations (as applicable, the " _Expiration Date_ ");  _provided_ ,
_however __,_ that if, at any time prior to the applicable Expiration Date,
(A) Parent (acting in good faith) delivers to the Equityholders
Representative a written notice alleging the existence of (1) an inaccuracy
in or a breach of any of the representations and warranties made by the
Company in _Article IV_ or (2) an otherwise indemnifiable event (and setting
forth in reasonable detail the basis for the Parents belief that such
an inaccuracy or breach may exist or the belief that an otherwise
indemnifiable event has occurred), or (B) the Equityholders Representative
(acting in good faith) delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written notice
alleging the existence of (1) an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of the
representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in _Article V_ or
(2) an otherwise indemnifiable event (and setting forth in reasonable detail
the basis for the belief of the Equityholders Representative that such an
inaccuracy or breach may exist or the belief that an otherwise indemnifiable
event has occurred) and asserting a claim for recovery under _Section 9.2_
based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach or indemnifiable event, then, in
the case of clause (A) or clause (B), the claim asserted in such notice as it
shall relate to the specific subject matter described in such notice shall
survive the Expiration Date, and, as set forth in the Escrow Agreement, the
aggregate amounts of such asserted claims shall remain with the Escrow Agent
and shall not be released from the Escrow Fund until such time as such claim
is fully and finally resolved. All covenants and agreements contained herein
which by their terms contemplate full performance at or prior to the Closing
shall terminate upon the Closing. Each covenant or agreement contained herein
which is to be performed by its terms after the Closing shall survive until
the last date for performance of such covenant or agreement as provided in
this Agreement. (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if any Parent Indemnitee (acting in good faith) asserts any claim
after Closing in respect of any Escheat Matter (an " _Escheat Claim_ "), and,
as of eighteen (18) months after the Effective Time, the Group Companies have
not received written acknowledgment by the applicable Governmental Authority
that the liability associated with such Escheat Claim has been fully
discharged or the statute of limitations (plus sixty (60) days) has not
expired (an " _Undischarged Escheat Claim_ "), then: (i) the greater of (A)
the aggregate of all Undischarged Escheat Claims, and (B) the amount of Two
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000.00) (as applicable, the "
_Escheat Matters Reserve_ "), shall remain with the Escrow Agent and shall not
be released from the Escrow Fund; and (ii) upon thirty (30) months after the
Effective Time, the Escheat Matters Reserve, less the aggregate amount of any
Undischarged Escheat Claims that remain subject to an outstanding written
demand for payment from a Governmental Authority as of such time, and any
other outstanding and unsatisfied claims for Escheat Matters, shall be
released to the Equityholders Representative. For clarity,

 



72  the amount of any indemnity claims, including any indemnity claims for
outstanding written demand for payment of any Undischarged Escheat Claims and
other claims for Escheat Matters, pending at the time that any portion of the
Escrow Fund is otherwise due to be released to the Equityholders
Representative, will not be released from the Escrow Fund and will remain with
the Escrow Agent until such time as such claims are fully and finally
resolved, in accordance with this _Article IX_ and the Escrow Agreement.

SECTION 9.2 _Right to Indemnification_.

(a) _Parent Indemnitees  Right to Indemnification_.

 

(i) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ and _Section
9.3_, from and after the Effective Time, the Parent Indemnitees shall be
entitled to be indemnified, solely from the Escrow Fund, against any Damages
incurred or sustained by the Parent Indemnitees arising out of or as a result
of: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty set forth in _Article
IV_. Solely for purposes of determining the amount of Damages actually
incurred by the Parent Indemnitees, the representations and warranties set
forth in _Article IV_ shall be read without giving effect to any materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or similar materiality qualification set forth
therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the representation set forth in
_Section 4.6(a)_ shall be read giving effect to the Material Adverse Effect
qualification set forth therein. Subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ and _Section 9.3_, any indemnification of the Parent
Indemnitees pursuant to this _Section 9.2(a)_ shall be paid solely and
exclusively from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, and no holder of Company Common Stock, Company RSU Awards, Company
Options, or any other Person shall be liable for any Damages directly,
including with respect to any deficiency with respect to the Escrow Fund.

(ii) Subject to the limitations set forth in  _Section 9.3_, from and after
the Effective Time, the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to be
indemnified, first from the Escrow Fund, and then, only to the extent the
Escrow Fund is insufficient, solely with respect to Damages incurred or
sustained by the Parent Indemnitees arising out of or as a result of any
Special Matter, from each Equityholder, on a several and not joint basis, in
accordance with such Equityholders Applicable Percentage of any Damages
incurred or sustained by the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to this _Section
9.2(a)_. No Equityholder shall be liable pursuant to this _Section
9.2(a)(ii)_ for an aggregate amount in excess of the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration actually received by such Equityholder pursuant to this
Agreement.

(b) _Equityholder Right to Indemnification_. 

(i) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.3_, from and after the
Effective Time, the Equityholders shall be entitled to be indemnified by
Parent and the Surviving Corporation against any Damages incurred by any of
the Equityholders arising out of or as a result of: (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in _Article V_ , without giving effect
to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar materiality
qualification set forth in any such representations or warranties; or (ii) any
material breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation set forth in this Agreement which is to be performed by its terms
after the Closing.

 



73 (ii) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.3_, from and after
the Effective Time, the Equityholders shall be entitled to be indemnified by
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on a joint and several basis, from and
against any Damages incurred or sustained by the Equityholders arising out of
or as a result of any Special Matter.

SECTION 9.3 _Limitations on Liability_.

 

(a) Except as provided for in _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_, the right of the Parent
Indemnitees to be indemnified from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this _Article
IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any breach of any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in, or any other breach by
the Company of, this Agreement. Except as provided for in  _Section
9.2(a)(ii)_, neither the Equityholders Representative nor any current or
former stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate or advisor of the
Company, of its Subsidiaries or of any Equityholder shall have any Liability
of any nature to the Parent Indemnitees with respect to any breach of any
representation or warranty contained in, or any other breach of, this
Agreement.

(b) The right of the Equityholders to be indemnified pursuant to this _Article
IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any breach of any
representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in, or any other
breach by Parent or Merger Sub of, this Agreement. No current or former
stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate or advisor of Parent or of
Merger Sub shall have any Liability of any nature to any Equityholder or any
Affiliate of any Equityholder with respect to any breach of any representation
or warranty contained in, or any other breach of, this Agreement.

(c) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
_Article IX_ , the indemnification provided for in _Section 9.2_ shall not
apply except to the extent that the aggregate Damages against which any
Indemnitee would otherwise be entitled to be indemnified under this _Article
IX_ exceeds Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000.00), in which event Indemnitee
shall, subject to the other limitations contained herein, be entitled to be
indemnified only against the portion of such Damages in excess of such amount.
For purposes of this Section, the Parent Indemnitees, on the one hand, and the
Equityholders, on the other hand, shall be considered one "Indemnitee".
Nothing in this _Section 9.3(c)_ will limit any remedy any of the Parent
Indemnitees or any of the Equityholders may have against any Person for any
applicable Special Matter.

 

(d) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
_Article IX_ , for purposes of computing the amount of any Damages incurred
by any Indemnitee (the Parent Indemnitees, on the one hand, and the
Equityholders, on the other hand, being considered one "Indemnitee" for
purposes of this Section) under this _Article IX_ , there shall be
deducted (i) an amount equal to the amount of any Tax benefit actually
realized by Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with such Damages or
any of the circumstances giving rise thereto; and (ii) an amount equal to the
amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution
payments or reimbursements received or reasonably expected to be realized by
Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with such Damages or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto (it being understood that Indemnitee and
any of its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
proceeds, payments or reimbursements prior to

 



74  seeking indemnification under this _Article IX_ ). The calculation of
Damages shall not include losses arising because of a change after Closing in
Law or accounting policy. To the extent that a claim for indemnification by
the Parent Indemnitees hereunder relates to a Liability incurred by the
Company and there is an accrual on the Company Financial Statements as of the
Balance Sheet Date in respect of such Liability, then the determination of
Damages in respect of such claim shall be net of such accrual.

(e) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
_Article IX_ , the Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
under this _Article IX_ to the extent that such indemnifiable event actually
gave rise to an adjustment to the Per Share Merger Consideration made
following the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.8_.

(f) Nothing in this _Section 9.3_ shall limit any remedy the Parent
Indemnitees or any of the Equityholders may have against any Person for actual
fraud involving a knowing and intentional misrepresentation of a fact, or a
knowing and intentional omission of a fact, material to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, made or omitted with the intent of inducing
any other party hereto to enter into this Agreement and upon which such other
party has relied (as opposed to any fraud claim based on constructive
knowledge or negligent misrepresentation or similar theory) under applicable
tort laws.

(g) Upon any Indemnitee becoming aware of any claim as to which
indemnification may be sought by such Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article IX_
, such Indemnitee shall utilize reasonable efforts, consistent with normal
practices and policies and good commercial practice, to mitigate
such Damages.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parent
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article IX_ with respect to any Tax attributes (including, without
limitation, tax basis, tax credits and net operating losses) of any Group
Company.

 

SECTION 9.4 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.

(a) Upon receipt by any Person seeking to be indemnified pursuant to _Section
9.2_ (the " _Indemnitee_ ") of notice of any actual or possible Action that
has been or may be brought or asserted by a third party against such
Indemnitee and that may be subject to indemnification hereunder (a " _Third-
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall promptly give notice of such Third-Party
Claim to the Person from whom indemnification is sought under _Section 9.2_
(the " _Indemnitor_ ") indicating the nature of such Third-Party Claim and the
stated basis therefor and the amount of Damages claimed pursuant to such
Third-Party Claim, to the extent known, _provided_ , however, that no delay
on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying the Indemnitor (or, if applicable,
the Carrier for any applicable Required Tail Coverage) shall relieve the
Indemnitor from its obligations hereunder, except and to the extent the
Indemnitor is prejudiced by such delay.

(b) The Indemnitor shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Indemnitees notice of a given Third-Party Claim to elect, at its option, to
assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim, in which case: (i) the
attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees and court or
arbitration costs incurred by the Indemnitor in connection with defending such
Third-Party Claim shall be payable by such Indemnitor; (ii) the Indemnitee
shall not be entitled to be

 



75  indemnified for any costs or expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim; (iii) the Indemnitee
shall be entitled to monitor such defense at its expense; (iv) the Indemnitee
shall make available to the Indemnitor all books, records and other documents
and materials that are under the direct or indirect control of the Indemnitee
or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates and that the Indemnitor
considers reasonably necessary or desirable for the defense of such Third-
Party Claim; (v) the Indemnitee shall execute such documents and take such
other actions as the Indemnitor may reasonably request for the purpose
of facilitating the defense of, or any settlement, compromise or adjustment
relating to, such Third-Party Claim; (vi) the Indemnitee shall otherwise fully
cooperate as reasonably requested by the Indemnitor in the defense of such
Third-Party Claim; (vii) the Indemnitee shall not admit any liability with
respect to such Third-Party Claim; and (viii) the Indemnitor shall not enter
into any agreement providing for the settlement or compromise of such Third-
Party Claim or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to such Third-
Party Claim without the prior written consent of Indemnitee (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement
agreement imposes on the Indemnitee or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates any obligation other than an obligation to pay monetary Damages in
an amount less than the aggregate cash amount remaining in the Escrow Fund;
_provided_ that, if in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Indemnitees,
there is a reasonable likelihood of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnitor and the Indemnitee, then the reasonable cost of one counsel for all
of the Indemnitees shall be borne by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor
elects not to defend such Third-Party Claim, then (x) the Indemnitee shall
diligently defend such Third-Party Claim, and (y) the Indemnitee shall have no
right to seek indemnification under this _Article IX_ in respect of such
Third-Party Claim for any agreement providing for the settlement or
compromise of such Third-Party Claim or the consent to the entry of a judgment
with respect to such Third-Party Claim entered into without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that except as otherwise set
forth in this Agreement, in no event shall the maximum aggregate Liability of
the Equityholders for indemnification claims payable by the Equityholders
hereunder exceed the Escrow Fund.

SECTION 9.5 _Subrogation_. To the extent that an Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ , the Indemnitor shall be
entitled to exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any rights and remedies
(including rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of
recovery) that the Indemnitee or any of the Indemnitees Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates may have against any other Person with respect to any Damages,
circumstances or matter to which such indemnification is directly or
indirectly related. The Indemnitee shall permit the Indemnitor to use the
name of the Indemnitee and its Affiliates in any transaction or in any
proceeding or other matter involving any of such rights or remedies, and the
Indemnitee shall take such actions as the Indemnitor may reasonably request
for the purpose of enabling the Indemnitor to perfect or exercise the right of
subrogation of the Indemnitor under this _Section 9.5_.

 

SECTION 9.6 _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement or provided for under any applicable Law, no
party nor any Equityholder or the Equityholders Representative, nor any
member, current or former shareholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate
or advisor of any of the foregoing, shall, in any event, be liable to
any other Person, either in contract, strict liability, tort or otherwise,
for any

 



76  special, indirect, consequential, exemplary or punitive Damages or any
Damages associated with any lost profits or lost opportunities of such other
Person, including loss of future revenue, income or profits, diminution of
value or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or
alleged breach hereof, whether or not the possibility of such Damages has been
disclosed to the other party in advance or could have been reasonably
foreseen by such other party, other than for actual fraud involving a knowing
and intentional misrepresentation of a fact, or a knowing and intentional
omission of a fact, material to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, made or omitted with the intent of inducing any other party hereto
to enter into this Agreement and upon which such other party has relied (as
opposed to any fraud claim based on constructive knowledge or negligent
misrepresentation or similar theory) under applicable tort laws.

SECTION 9.7 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. The parties agree
that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be
treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration
unless otherwise required by Law.

 

SECTION 9.8 _Prosecution of Escheat Matters_. The parties acknowledge and
agree that, promptly after Closing, Parent shall initiate and prosecute,
and/or to cause the applicable Group Companies to initiate and prosecute, the
resolution of all potential Escheat Matters outstanding as of Closing, in each
case in consultation with the Equityholders Representative. The
Equityholders Representative will fully cooperate with Parent and the Group
Companies in the prosecution of the resolution of all Escheat Matters. At the
request of the Equityholders Representative, the
Equityholders Representative may participate with Parent and the applicable
Group Companies in discussions and negotiations with the applicable
Governmental Authorities regarding the resolution of any Escheat Matter.
Parent shall not, and shall cause the applicable Group Companies not to,
settle or pay any claim in resolution of any Escheat Matter without the
Equityholders Representatives prior written approval (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). Any professional fees and
related expenses and Allocated Labor Costs (as defined below) incurred in
connection with the prosecution, negotiation, and resolution of any Escheat
Matters in excess of $300,000.00 per calendar year or $600,000.00 in the
aggregate shall require the approval of the Equityholders Representative,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.
Parent shall track, and/or cause the applicable Group Companies to track, and
report to the Equityholders Representative, on not less than a quarterly
basis, those man-hours spent by employees of Parent or any applicable Group
Company in gathering information and otherwise assisting in the prosecution of
the resolution of the Escheat Matters, and the resulting allocated direct
compensation expense for such employees (based upon a reasonable hourly rate
for such employees) (" _Allocated Labor Costs_ "), and any related costs and
expenses incurred by Parent or any applicable Group Company arising out of or
in connection with such activities.

ARTICLE X.

as such), with full power of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead
of each Equityholder with respect to and in connection with and to facilitate
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the taking
by the Equityholders Representative of any and all actions and the making of
any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Equityholders
Representative under _Section 2.8_, _Article IX_ or the Escrow Agreement (it

each representative thereof shall not be liable to any Person for any act of
the Equityholders Representative taken in good faith and in the exercise of
its reasonable judgment and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of its duties under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement (it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to
the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith
and reasonable judgment), except to the extent it is ultimately and finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and all rights of appeal have
been lapsed that any Damages actually have been incurred by such Person as a
proximate result of the gross negligence or bad faith of the Equityholders
Representative. The Equityholders Representative shall not be liable for, and
may seek indemnification from the Equityholders for, any Damages incurred by
the Equityholders Representative while acting in good faith and in the

negligence or bad faith of the Equityholders Representative.

 

(c) _Equityholder Reserve_. The Equityholder Reserve shall be available to
indemnify and hold the Equityholders Representative harmless against any
Damages incurred by the Equityholders Representative arising out of or in

(d) _Actions of the Equityholders  Representative_. From and after the
Effective Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the Equityholders

upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Equityholders
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each
Equityholder. Parent is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for

instruction of the Equityholders Representative.

SECTION 10.5 _Public Announcements_. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law or applicable stock exchange rules and regulations, no party to this
Agreement shall make any public announcements in respect of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or otherwise communicate with
any news media regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other

 



80  parties to this Agreement. If a public statement is required to be made
pursuant to applicable Law or applicable stock exchange rules and regulations,
the parties shall consult with each other, to the extent reasonably
practicable, in advance as to the contents and timing thereof.

SECTION 10.6 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the terms
or provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other certificate,
instrument or other document referred to in this Agreement, shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or
provision of this Agreement or any other such certificate, instrument or other
document referred to in this Agreement, and the parties to this
Agreement shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to substitute one
or more valid, legal and enforceable terms or provisions into this Agreement
which, insofar as practicable, implement the purposes and intent of this
Agreement. Any term or provision of this Agreement held invalid or
unenforceable only in part, degree or within certain jurisdictions shall
remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable to the extent consistent with the intent of the parties
as reflected by this Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
each party waives any term or provision of Law which renders any term or
provision of this Agreement to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect.

 

SECTION 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the other Schedules and the Exhibits to this Agreement)
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the
parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement
and the Confidentiality Agreement, and supersede all prior agreements
and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties to this Agreement
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.

 

SECTION 10.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties to
this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties to this Agreement, and any purported
assignment or other transfer without such consent shall be void
and unenforceable, _provided_ that Parent may assign this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement,  _provided_ _further_ , however, that such assignment shall not
relieve Parent of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

SECTION 10.9 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for _Article II_ ,
_Section 6.6_ and _Section 6.7_, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.10 _Waivers and Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or
modified only by a written instrument executed by all of the parties to this
Agreement. Any

 



81  failure of the parties to this Agreement to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition in this Agreement may be waived by the party
entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the
party granting such waiver. No delay on the part of any party to this
Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party to this
Agreement of any right, power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of
any other right, power or privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder. Unless otherwise provided, the rights and remedies
provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies which the parties to this Agreement may otherwise have at
law or in equity. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on
behalf of a party, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner
consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in
this _Section 10.10_.

SECTION 10.11 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely
within such State. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally submits, for itself and its assets and properties, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State court, or Federal court of the
United States of America, sitting within the State of Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the agreements delivered in connection with this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties to this
Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence
any such Action except in such courts; (ii) agrees that any claim in respect
of any such Action may be heard and determined in such Delaware State court
or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such Federal court; (iii) waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Action in any
such Delaware State or Federal court; and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such Action in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties
to this Agreement hereby agrees that a final judgment in any such Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties to this
Agreement hereby irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in _Section 10.4_. Nothing in this Agreement shall
affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by applicable Law.

SECTION 10.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS

 



82  REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 10.12_.

 

SECTION 10.13 _Specific Performance_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the
one hand, and the Company and the Equityholders Representative, hereby
acknowledge and agree that the failure of either of them to perform its
agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take all actions
as are necessary on its part in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement to consummate the Merger, may cause irreparable injury to
the other parties, for which Damages, even if available, may not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company and the Equityholders Representative, on the other hand,
hereby consents to the other party seeking the issuance of injunctive relief
by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such partys
obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder or injunctive relief against the
other partys activities in breach of this Agreement, without any requirement
that a bond or other security be posted.

 

SECTION 10.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original,
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
