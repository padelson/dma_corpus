 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 ** _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares or
securities of Parent, the Company or Merger Sub:

 



 

(i) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(ii) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
or held in treasury by the Company and each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
by Parent, its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be

 



      
 

 



 

cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist (the "Cancelled Shares"), and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect
thereof.

 



 

(iii) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to the other provisions of
this _Article II_, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares and
any Dissenting Shares) shall, at the Effective Time, be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive (A) $20
plus, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to October 31, 2018,
an additional $0.01 for each day during the period commencing on November 1,
2018 and ending on the Closing Date, in cash (the "Cash Consideration") and
(B) 0.42 shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio" and together with
the cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as specified
below and the Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). From and after
the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company
Common Stock represented by book-entry form ("Book-Entry Shares") and each
certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate")) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or
Certificate have been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ as well as any
dividends or other distributions to which holders of Company Common Stock
shall become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_.

 



 

(b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of
record who did not vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (or consent
thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal
of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL ("DGCL 262" and any such shares meeting
the requirement of this sentence, "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead at the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive payment of such
amounts as are payable in accordance with DGCL 262 (it being understood and
acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
other than the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares to
the extent afforded by DGCL 262); _provided_ , that if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under DGCL 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holderÂ’s Dissenting
Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, without interest or duplication, the Merger
Consideration. The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any
demands received by the Company for fair value of any shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to DGCL 262 and of any withdrawals of such demands, and Parent
shall have the opportunity to participate in all

 



      
 

 



 

negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to
settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (and as permitted by _Article V_), the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of
shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section
2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in the Merger upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
with respect to Book-Entry Shares or otherwise, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. Each holder of Company Common Stock or a Company
Long Term Incentive Award converted pursuant to the Merger that would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after aggregating all shares evidenced by the Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive from Parent, in lieu
thereof and upon surrender thereof, a cash payment (without interest) in an
amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
multiplied by the Parent Common Stock VWAP (rounded down to the nearest
penny).

 



 

Section 2.2 _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Prior to Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange
Agent"), the identity and the terms of appointment of which to be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the Merger Consideration and
shall enter into an agreement relating to the Exchange AgentÂ’s
responsibilities with respect thereto, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. No later than substantially
concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Common Stock in
book-entry form (and/or certificates representing such Parent Common Stock, at
ParentÂ’s election) representing the full number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock sufficient to deliver the stock portion of the aggregate Merger
Consideration and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the cash portion of
the aggregate Merger Consideration, in each case payable in the Merger to all
holders of Company Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto and any amounts to be paid in cash in lieu
of fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.1(d)_, the "Exchange
Fund").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the Closing
Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii) _into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon, (i) with respect to shares evidenced
by Certificates, delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) and (ii) with respect to Book-Entry Shares, upon proper delivery of
an "agentÂ’s message" regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares
(or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request), as applicable, to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
agree upon prior to the Effective Time) (the "Letter of Transmittal") and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled
in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_.

 



 

(c) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, together with a
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive, within two (2) Business Days following
the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Exchange AgentÂ’s
receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Share, in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the
shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement together with any dividends or other
distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled
in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer or
stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon, or shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid or
issued, as the case may be, to such a transferee if such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.3(c)_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration into which the
shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with any dividends or other
distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled
in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_.

 



 

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions, if
any, with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common
Stock, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered share of Company
Common Stock to be converted into cash and shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ until such holder shall surrender such
share in accordance with this _Section 2.3(d)_. After the surrender in
accordance

 



      
 

 



 

with this _Section 2.3(d)_ of a share of Company Common Stock to be converted
into cash and shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (in addition to
the Merger Consideration payable to such holder pursuant to this _Article
II_) any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon,
which theretofore had become payable with respect to the share of Parent
Common Stock represented by such share of Company Common Stock.

 



 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The shares of
Parent Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall
be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall
cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right
to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with _Section 2.3(c)_ (together with any dividends or other
distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled
in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_), without interest and (ii) the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From
and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing
shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Article II_, and following
any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund, and such
investments shall only be in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America or in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the
Laws of a state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation or MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc.,
respectively. Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the
benefit of the holders of the Company Common Stock and (ii) applied promptly
to making the payments pursuant to _Section 2.1_. The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section
2.1_, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. Any interest or
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon
demand.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general
creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration and
any dividends and distributions which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this _Article II_ without any interest thereon.

 



 

(h) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration or
the cash to be paid in accordance with this _Article II_ that remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of the
second anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

 



 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to (and, with respect
to Company Long Term Incentive Awards, shall) deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of a Certificate, a Book-Entry
Share or a Company Long Term Incentive Award pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted and
withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority and shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Company Long Term Incentive Award in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed
and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person
of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject
to _Section 2.3(g)_, Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost,
stolen, mutilated or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any
dividends and distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.4 _Company Long Term Incentive Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Company Options_. Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock,
whether vested or unvested, that was granted prior to the date of this
Agreement and is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Company Option") shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive in respect of each Net
Option Share, if any, subject to such Company Option, the Merger Consideration
(in the same proportion of Cash Consideration and Parent Common Stock as
payable with respect to Company Common Stock). For purposes of this Agreement,
"Net Option Share" means, with respect to a Company Option, the quotient
obtained by dividing (i) the product obtained by multiplying (A) the excess,
if any, of the Merger Consideration Value over the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Merger
Consideration Value. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the "Merger
Consideration Value" means the sum of (1) the Cash Consideration and (2) the
product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the Parent Common Stock VWAP.

 



 

(b) _Company RSUs and RSAs_. Each award of Company RSUs that was granted prior
to the date of this Agreement and is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested (with any
performance-based vesting conditions deemed to be satisfied as described
below) and shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock underlying such award of Company
RSUs, the Merger Consideration. The Surviving Corporation shall transfer, in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.4(e)_, to the holders of Company
RSUs the amounts described in this _Section 2.4(b)_. Each award of restricted
shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a "Company RSA") that was granted prior to the date of
this Agreement shall, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, become
fully vested (with any performance-based vesting conditions deemed to be
satisfied as described below) and paid out in accordance with _Section
2.4(e)_. Performance-based vesting conditions shall be deemed satisfied as
follows:

 



 

(i) With respect to any equity awards granted in 2016, the level of
achievement of the applicable performance-based vesting criteria shall be
determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors
prior to Closing, in its reasonable discretion, based on the CompanyÂ’s actual
performance through the end of the month immediately preceding the month in
which the Closing Date occurs (or if such data is not available, then through
the end of the then most-recent month for which data is available), as
extrapolated through the remainder of the performance period.

 



 

(ii) With respect to any equity awards granted on April 4, 2017, the
performance-based vesting conditions shall be deemed satisfied.

 



 

(iii) With respect to any equity awards granted in 2017 prior to the date of
this Agreement (other than as set forth in _Section 2.4(b)(ii)_), the
performance-based vesting conditions shall be deemed satisfied as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

(A) With respect to one-third (1/3) of each award, satisfaction of
performance-based vesting conditions shall be determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board of Directors prior to Closing, in its
reasonable discretion, based on the CompanyÂ’s actual performance through
December 31, 2017, as extrapolated through the remainder of the performance
period; and

 



 

(B) With respect to the remaining two-thirds (2/3) of each award, performance-
based vesting criteria shall be deemed satisfied at "target" (100%)
performance.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, all performance-based vesting criteria applicable
to an award of Company RSUs or Company RSAs that is granted on or after the
date of this Agreement and that remains outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a "Post-Signing Award") shall be deemed satisfied at
"target" (100%) performance. As of the Effective Time, (i) each Post-Signing
Award granted to a non-employee director of the Company, (ii) the first
tranche of each Post-Signing Award granted to an employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that has an annual vesting schedule that is due to
vest following the Effective Time or has a cliff vesting schedule of less than
two years and (iii) one-third (1/3) of each Post-Signing Award granted to an
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that has a cliff vesting
schedule of two years or longer shall become fully vested and shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive, in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock underlying such Post-Signing Award or such portion of
such Post-Signing Award, as applicable, the Merger Consideration. The
Surviving Corporation shall transfer, in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 2.4(e)_, to the holders of each Post-Signing Award the amounts
described in the previous sentence of this _Section 2.4(c)_. The remaining
portion of each Post-Signing Award shall, without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into a corresponding
award (a "Parent Award") with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such portion of the Post-Signing Award and (B) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.4(c)_, each
Parent Award assumed and converted pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)_ shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to the corresponding Company RSU or Company RSA, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) _Certain Tax Considerations_. The actions contemplated by this _Section
2.4_ shall be taken in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to any Company
Long Term Incentive Award, that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent that payment of the amounts
described in this _Section 2.4_ would otherwise cause the imposition of a Tax
or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, Parent shall cause the Company to
make such payment at the earliest time permitted under the Company equity
plans and applicable award agreement that shall not result in the imposition
of such Tax or penalty.

 



 

(e) _Company Actions_.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors and/or an
appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing for, and take

 



       
 

 



 

all other actions necessary to effectuate (A) the treatment of the Company
Options, Company RSUs and Company RSAs (collectively, the "Company Long Term
Incentive Awards") as contemplated by this Section 2.4 and (B) to the extent
the following actions would permit the payout of any Company Long Term
Incentive Awards that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject
to Section 409A of the Code under this _Section 2.4_ without the delay caused
by Section 409A of the Code (as described in _Section 2.4(b)_ and _Section
2.4(c)_), the termination of each Company equity plan and each Company Benefit
Plan governing such Company Long Term Incentive Award (including CompanyÂ’s
Director Deferred Compensation Plan and any applicable award agreement
governing the applicable Company Long Term Incentive Award), with respect to
any liability related thereto, in each case, effective as of and subject to
the occurrence of the Effective Time.

 



 

(ii) Subject to _Sections 2.3(i)_ and _2.4(d)_ , the Surviving Corporation
shall make all of the payments and deliver all shares of Parent Common Stock
required by _Sections 2.4(a)_ , _2.4(b)_ and _2.4(c)_ within two (2)
Business Days following the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) _Parent Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all
actions necessary to reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock in respect of each Parent Share Award and Company RSU in respect of
which payment is delayed pursuant _Section 2.4(d)_. Effective as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8, Form
S-3 or Form S-1 (or any successor or other appropriate form), as applicable,
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such award
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such awards remain outstanding.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Further Assurances_. If at any time before or after the Effective
Time, Parent or the Company reasonably believes or is advised that any further
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and
directors shall execute and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds,
assignments or assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement.

or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such losses,

structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on
the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item

procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
CompanyÂ’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The CompanyÂ’s management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the CompanyÂ’s internal control
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2016, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective. Based on its most
recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior to the
date hereof, management of the Company has disclosed to the CompanyÂ’s auditors
and the audit committee of the Company Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the CompanyÂ’s ability to report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the CompanyÂ’s
internal control over financial reporting, in each case, that was disclosed to
the CompanyÂ’s auditors or the audit committee of the Company Board of
Directors in connection with its most recent evaluation of internal controls
over financial reporting prior to the date hereof.

any assets required for the conduct of their business or result in any

all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the

structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on
the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item

reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to ParentÂ’s management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. ParentÂ’s management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of ParentÂ’s internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for

Material Adverse Effect. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance
with all Gaming Laws applicable to them or by which any of their respective
properties are bound, except where any non-compliance would not be material to
the operations or business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Effect, all Parent Permits are in all respects valid and in full force and
effect and are not subject to any administrative or judicial proceeding that

action would constitute a breach of such other provision.

 



 

(d) Parent agrees with the Company, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries,
that, from the date hereof and prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and

Section 5.2 _Access_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of facilitating the transactions contemplated hereby, each of

the accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors, financing
sources and agents and other representatives of the other Party such
reasonable access during normal business hours,

 



      
 

 



 

throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the
Termination Date, to its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ personnel and properties,
contracts, commitments, books and records and any report, schedule or other
document filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of applicable
Laws and with such additional accounting, financing, operating, environmental
and other data and information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
Company and Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to provide access to or make
available to any person any document or information that, in the reasonable
judgment of such Party, (i) violates any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality, (ii) is subject to any attorney-client, work-product or other
legal privilege, or (iii) the disclosure of which would violate any Law or
legal duty ( _provided_ that the withholding Party will use reasonable efforts
to allow such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in loss or
waiver of such privilege, including, but not limited to, entering into
appropriate common interest or similar agreements); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that nothing herein shall authorize Parent or its Representatives to undertake
any environmental testing or sampling at any of the properties owned, operated
or leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries and nothing herein shall
authorize the Company or its respective Representatives to undertake any
environmental testing or sampling at any of the properties owned, operated or
leased by Parent or its Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and the Company agrees
that it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any
information obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ for any competitive or
other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (which transactions, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
include with respect to Parent the Financing). Each of the Company and Parent
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the
businesses of the other Party that may result from requests for access.

 



 

(b) The Parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or
their respective officers, directors, employees or representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed in accordance with the amended and
restated confidential disclosure agreement, dated as of May 15, 2017, between
the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

 



 

Section 5.3 _Company No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, the Company shall,
and the Company shall cause each of its Affiliates and its and their
respective officers, directors and employees to, and shall cause the agents,
financial advisors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
representatives (collectively "Representatives") of the Company or any of its
Affiliates to: (A) immediately cease any solicitation, knowing encouragement,
discussions or negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with respect
to a Company Takeover Proposal, and promptly instruct (to the extent it has
contractual authority to do so and has not already done so prior to the date
of this Agreement) or otherwise request, any person that has executed a
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement within the 12-month period prior
to the date of this Agreement in connection with any actual or potential
Company Takeover Proposal to return or destroy all such confidential
information or documents previously furnished in connection therewith or
material incorporating any such information in the possession of such person
or its Representatives and (B) from and after the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VII_,

 



      
 

 



 

not, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Takeover Proposal, (2) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
substantive discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other
person any non-public information in connection with or for the purpose of
encouraging or facilitating, a Company Takeover Proposal or (3) approve,
recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any
letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in
principle providing for a Company Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(b) Except as expressly provided by this Agreement, the Company shall not take
any action to exempt any person from the restrictions on "business
combinations" contained in Â§ 203 of the DGCL or the Company Organizational
Documents or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply. Except (i) as
necessary to take any actions that the Company or any third party would
otherwise be permitted to take pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ (and in such
case only in accordance with the terms hereof) or (ii) if the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that any such action or
forbearance would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (A) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or
grant permission under any (i) standstill provision in any agreement to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (ii) confidentiality
provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party (excluding any waiver under a confidentiality provision that does not,
and would not reasonably be likely to, facilitate or encourage a Company
Takeover Proposal) and (B) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, enforce the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any such
agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.3_,
if at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company, directly or
indirectly receives a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Company Takeover
Proposal from any person and the Company, its Affiliates and the CompanyÂ’s and
its AffiliateÂ’s Representatives are not in Willful and Material Breach of this
_Section 5.3_ and if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, and failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may, directly
or indirectly, (A) furnish, pursuant to a Company Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and afford access to the business, properties,
assets, employees, officers, Contracts, books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, to the person that has made such Company Takeover Proposal
and its Representatives and potential sources of funding; _provided_ that the
Company shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to such person
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its
Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously
provided or made available to Parent and (B) engage in or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Company
Takeover Proposal

 



      
 

 



 

(including as a part thereof, making counterproposals) and its Representatives
and potential sources of financing regarding such Company Takeover Proposal.
"Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means any customary
confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable
in the aggregate to the Company than those applicable to Parent that are
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that such confidentiality
agreement shall not prohibit compliance by the Company with any of the
provisions of this _Section 5.3_.

 



 

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than forty-eight (48)
hours after receipt) notify, orally and in writing, Parent of any Company
Takeover Proposal received by the Company or any of its Representatives, which
notice shall include the identity of the person making the Company Takeover
Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof (including copies of
any written proposal relating thereto provided to the Company or any of its
Representatives) and indicate whether the Company has furnished non-public
information to, or entered into discussions or negotiations with, such third
party. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis as to the status of (including changes to any material terms of,
and any other material developments with respect to) such Company Takeover
Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into
any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which
prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance
with this _Section 5.3_.

 



 

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3(e)_, the Company
Board of Directors shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (B) change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change,
qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation, (C) make or publicly propose to make any
recommendation in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than
a recommendation against such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board of Directors of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (it being understood that the Company
Board of Directors may refrain from taking a position with respect to such a
tender offer or exchange offer until the close of business as of the tenth
(10th) Business Day after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange
offer pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without such action
being considered a Company Adverse Recommendation Change so long as the
Company reaffirms the Company Recommendation during such period), (D) other
than with respect to the period of up to ten (10) Business Days applicable to
formal tender or exchange offers that are the subject of the preceding clause
(C), fail to recommend against a Company Takeover Proposal or fail to reaffirm
the Company Recommendation, in either case within five (5) Business Days after
a request by Parent to do so; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) such five (5)
Business Day period shall be extended for an additional five (5) Business Days
following any material modification to any Company Takeover Proposal occurring
after the receipt of ParentÂ’s written request and (2) Parent shall be entitled
to make such a written request for reaffirmation only once for each Company
Takeover Proposal and once for each material amendment to such Company
Takeover Proposal; (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to
as an "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) authorize, cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement, commitment or agreement in principle providing for any
Company Takeover

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal (other than a Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered
into in accordance with _Section 5.3(c)_). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, (x) the Company Board of Directors may make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (1) the Company is not in Willful
and Material Breach of this _Section 5.3_ and (2) after receiving a _bona
fide_ unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal, the Company Board of
Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (i) such Company Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (ii) in light of such
Company Takeover Proposal, the failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board of DirectorsÂ’ fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and/or (y) the Company may terminate this
Agreement in order to enter into a binding written agreement with respect to a
Company Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 7.1(j)_; _provided_
that the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with the Company Board of DirectorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement as described in clauses
(x) and (y) of this sentence, (A) the Company has given Parent at least three
(3) Business DaysÂ’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such
Company Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy
of the Company Superior Proposal and a copy of any written proposed
transaction documents with the person making such Superior Proposal, (B) the
Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to
the extent Parent wishes to negotiate in good faith, to enable Parent to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such
Company Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal,
(C) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board of Directors
shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that the Company Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior
Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect, and (D)
in the event of any change to any material terms of such Company Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an
additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) above of this
proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall
commence (except that the three (3) Business Day period notice period referred
to in clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of
(i) two (2) Business Days and (ii) the period remaining under the notice
period under clause (A) of this proviso immediately prior to the delivery of
such additional notice under this clause (D)) during which time the Company
shall be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)_
anew with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D)
above of this proviso.

 



 

(f) Other than in connection with a Company Superior Proposal (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be subject to _Section 5.3(e)_ and shall not be
subject to this _Section 5.3(f)_), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit
or restrict the Company Board of Directors from making a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening Event if the
Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
failure of the Company Board of

 



       
 

 



 

Directors to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the Company Board of DirectorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, (i) the Company has given Parent at least three
(3) Business DaysÂ’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
which notice shall specify the reasons therefor, (ii) the Company has
negotiated, and directed its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with
Parent during such notice period after giving any such notice, to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms
of this Agreement such that it would not permit the Company Board of Directors
to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section
5.3(f)_ and (iii) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board
of Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of
this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
such Company Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the Company Board of
DirectorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the stockholders
of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look and listen"
communication or any other similar disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if, in the
determination in good faith of the Company Board of Directors, after
consultation with outside counsel, the failure so to disclose would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or obligations under applicable federal securities Law of the
Company Board of Directors.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Parent No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.4_, Parent shall, and
Parent shall cause each of its Affiliates and its and their respective
officers, directors and employees to, and shall cause the Representatives of
Parent or any of its Affiliates to: (A) immediately cease any solicitation,
knowing encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any persons that may
be ongoing with respect to a Parent Takeover Proposal, and promptly instruct
(to the extent it has contractual authority to do so and has not already done
so prior to the date of this Agreement) or otherwise request, any person that
has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement within the 12-month
period prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with any actual or
potential Parent Takeover Proposal to return or destroy all such confidential
information or documents previously furnished in connection therewith or
material incorporating any such information in the possession of such person
or its Representatives and (B) from and after the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VII_, not, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries
regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Parent Takeover Proposal, (2) engage in,
continue or otherwise participate in any substantive discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any non-public
information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating, a Parent Takeover Proposal or (3) approve,

 



      
 

 



 

recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any
letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in
principle providing for a Parent Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(b) Except as expressly provided by this Agreement, Parent shall not take any
action to exempt any person from the restrictions on "business combinations"
contained in subchapters 25 of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of
1988 or the Parent Organizational Documents or otherwise cause such
restrictions not to apply. Except (i) as necessary to take any actions that
Parent or any third party would otherwise be permitted to take pursuant to
this _Section 5.4_ (and in such case only in accordance with the terms
hereof) or (ii) if the Parent Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that any such action or forbearance would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (A) Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall not release any third party from, or waive, amend or
modify any provision of, or grant permission under any (i) standstill
provision in any agreement to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or (ii) confidentiality provision in any agreement to which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party (excluding any waiver under a
confidentiality provision that does not, and would not reasonably be likely
to, facilitate or encourage a Parent Takeover Proposal) and (B) Parent shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the confidentiality and
standstill provisions of any such agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.4_,
if at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval, Parent, directly or indirectly
receives a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Parent Takeover Proposal from any
person and Parent, its Affiliates and ParentÂ’s and its Affiliates
Representatives are not in Willful and Material Breach of this _Section 5.4_
and if the Parent Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such Parent Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal, and failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then Parent and its Representatives may, directly or
indirectly, (i) furnish, pursuant to a Parent Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to
Parent and its Subsidiaries, and afford access to the business, properties,
assets, employees, officers, Contracts, books and records of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, to the person that has made such Parent Takeover Proposal and
its Representatives and potential sources of funding; _provided_ that Parent
shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to such person provide to
the Company any non-public information concerning Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its
Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously
provided or made available to the Company and (ii) engage in or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Parent
Takeover Proposal (including as a part thereof, making counterproposals) and
its Representatives and potential sources of financing regarding such Parent
Takeover Proposal. "Parent Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means any
customary confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to Parent than those applicable to the Company that
are contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that such
confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit compliance by Parent with any of
the provisions of this _Section 5.4_.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Parent shall promptly (and in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours
after receipt) notify, orally and in writing, Company of any Parent Takeover
Proposal received by Parent or any of its Representatives, which notice shall
include the identity of the person making the Parent Takeover Proposal and the
material terms and conditions thereof (including copies of any written
proposal relating thereto provided to Parent or any of its Representatives)
and indicate whether Parent has furnished non-public information to, or
entered into discussions or negotiations with, such third party. Parent shall
keep Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis as to the
status of (including changes to any material terms of, and any other material
developments with respect to) such Parent Takeover Proposal. Parent agrees
that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Parent from
providing any information to the Company in accordance with this _Section
5.4_.

 



 

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.4(e)_, the Parent Board
of Directors shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Parent Recommendation in
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw
or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Company, the Parent
Recommendation, (C) make or publicly propose to make any recommendation in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation
against such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Parent Board of Directors of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act (it being understood that the Parent Board of Directors may
refrain from taking a position with respect to such a tender offer or exchange
offer until the close of business as of the tenth (10th) Business Day after
the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without such action being considered a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change so long as Parent reaffirms the Parent
Recommendation during such period), (D) other than with respect to the period
of up to ten (10) Business Days applicable to formal tender or exchange offers
that are the subject of the preceding clause (C), fail to recommend against a
Parent Takeover Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Parent Recommendation, in
either case within ten (10) Business Days after a request by the Company to do
so; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) such ten (10) Business Day period shall
be extended for an additional ten (10) Business Days following any material
modification to any Parent Takeover Proposal occurring after the receipt of
the CompanyÂ’s written request and (2) the Company shall be entitled to make
such a written request for reaffirmation only once for each Parent Takeover
Proposal and once for each material amendment to such Parent Takeover Proposal
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) authorize, cause or permit Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement,
commitment or agreement in principle providing for any Parent Takeover
Proposal (other than a Parent Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered
into in accordance with _Section 5.4(c)_). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Parent Shareholder
Approval is obtained, (x) the Parent Board of Directors may make a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change if (1) Parent is not in Willful and Material
Breach of this _Section 5.4_ and (2) after receiving a _bona fide_
unsolicited written Parent Takeover Proposal, the Parent Board of Directors
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that (i) such Parent Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal and (ii) in light of such Parent
Takeover Proposal, the failure to take such

 



      
 

 



 

action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Parent Board of
DirectorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, prior to making any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change as described
above, (A) Parent has given the Company at least three (3) Business DaysÂ’
prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of any such Parent Superior
Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the Parent
Superior Proposal and a copy of any written proposed transaction documents
with the person making such Superior Proposal, (B) Parent has negotiated in
good faith with the Company during such notice period, to the extent the
Company wishes to negotiate in good faith, to enable the Company to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Parent
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Parent Superior Proposal, (C)
following the end of such notice period, the Parent Board of Directors shall
have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by the Company, and shall have determined, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that the Parent Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Parent Superior
Proposal if the revisions proposed by the Company were to be given effect, and
(D) in the event of any change to any material terms of such Parent Superior
Proposal, Parent shall, in each case, have delivered to the Company an
additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) above of this
proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall
commence (except that the three (3) Business Day period notice period referred
to in clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of
(i) two (2) Business Days and (ii) the period remaining under the notice
period under clause (A) of this proviso immediately prior to the delivery of
such additional notice under this clause (D)) during which time Parent shall
be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.4(e)_ anew
with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D)
above of this proviso.

 



 

(f) Other than in connection with a Parent Superior Proposal (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be subject to _Section 5.4(e)_ and shall not be
subject to this _Section 5.4(f)_), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit
or restrict the Parent Board of Directors from making a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Parent Intervening Event if the Parent
Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
Parent Board of Directors to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would
be inconsistent with the Parent Board of DirectorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making such Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, (i) Parent has given the Company at least three
(3) Business DaysÂ’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
which notice shall specify the reasons therefor, (ii) Parent has negotiated,
and directed its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with the Company
during such notice period after giving any such notice, to the extent the
Company wishes to negotiate, to enable the Company to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement such that it would not permit the Parent Board of
Directors to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this
_Section 5.4(f)_ and (iii) following the end of such notice period, the
Parent Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by the Company, and shall have
determined, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that failure to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to such Parent

 



      
 

 



 

Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the Parent Board of DirectorsÂ’
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit Parent or the
Parent Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of
Parent a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look and listen"
communication or any other similar disclosure to the stockholders of Parent
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if, in the determination in
good faith of the Parent Board of Directors, after consultation with outside
counsel, the failure so to disclose would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties under applicable Law or obligations
under applicable federal securities Law of the Parent Board of Directors.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form

reservation of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of
Company Common Stock, or holders of a beneficial interest therein, as may be

Statement/Prospectus will be made by Parent or the Company, as applicable,
without the otherÂ’s prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and without providing the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon (which comments shall be considered
by the other Party in good faith); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company,
in connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, a Company Takeover
Proposal or a Company Superior Proposal may amend or supplement the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and/or the Form S-4 (including by incorporation by
reference) pursuant to a Company Qualifying Amendment, and in such event, this
right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to
Parent or its business, financial condition or results of operations;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that Parent, in connection with a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, a Parent Takeover Proposal or a Parent Superior
Proposal may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and/or
the Form S-4 (including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Parent
Qualifying Amendment, and in such event, this right of approval shall apply
only with respect to information relating to the Company or its

 



      
 

 



 

business, financial condition or results of operations. A "Company Qualifying
Amendment" means an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (including by incorporation by reference) to the extent
it contains (a) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (b) a statement of
the reason of the Board of Directors of the Company for making such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, (c) a factually accurate statement by the
Company that describes the CompanyÂ’s receipt of a Company Takeover Proposal or
Company Superior Proposal, the terms of such proposal and the operation of
this Agreement with respect thereto, and (d) additional information reasonably
related to the foregoing. A "Parent Qualifying Amendment" means an amendment
or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
(including by incorporation by reference) to the extent it contains (a) a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, (b) a statement of the reason of the
Parent Board of Directors for making such Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change, (c) a factually accurate statement by Parent that describes the
ParentÂ’s receipt of a Parent Takeover Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal,
the terms of such proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto, and (d) additional information reasonably related to the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other
with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 and advise the other
Party of any oral comments with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments from the SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4. Parent
or the Company, as applicable, will advise the other promptly after it
receives oral or written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has become
effective or any supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, the threat or
issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or comments
thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information, and will promptly provide the other with copies of any written
communication from the SEC or any state securities commission. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the Company,
or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by
Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of
such documents would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein (in light of
the circumstances under which they were made), not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company. At the CompanyÂ’s request, Parent shall
reasonably cooperate in amending or supplementing the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus pursuant to a Company Qualifying

 



      
 

 



 

Amendment made in compliance with this Agreement. At ParentÂ’s request, the
Company shall reasonably cooperate in amending or supplementing the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus pursuant to a Parent Qualifying Amendment made in
compliance with this Agreement.

 



 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus by the SEC, the Company shall take all action
necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Company Organizational
Documents to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and
holding the Company Stockholder Advisory Vote (the "Company StockholdersÂ’
Meeting") and not postpone or adjourn the Company StockholdersÂ’ Meeting except
(i) to the extent required by applicable Law or to solicit additional proxies
or (ii) votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement if sufficient votes to
constitute the Company Stockholder Approval have not been obtained; _provided_
that, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Company StockholdersÂ’
Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than twenty
(20) days after the date for which the Company StockholdersÂ’ Meeting was
originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by
applicable Law). The Company will, except in the case of a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, through the Company Board of Directors, recommend that
its stockholders adopt this Agreement and will use reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and to take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of the Nasdaq or
applicable Laws to obtain such approvals.

 



 

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus by the SEC, Parent shall take all action necessary
in accordance with applicable Laws and ParentÂ’s Amended and Restated Articles
of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws to duly give notice of,
convene and hold the Parent ShareholdersÂ’ Meeting for the purpose of obtaining
the Parent Shareholder Approval and not postpone or adjourn the Parent
ShareholdersÂ’ Meeting except to the extent required by applicable Law or to
solicit additional proxies and votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement if
sufficient votes to constitute the Parent Shareholder Approval have not been
obtained; _provided_ that, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Parent

best efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the Share
Issuance and to take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of its shareholders required by the rules of Nasdaq or
applicable Laws to obtain such approvals.

 



 

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Shareholders Meeting
on the same date and at the same time.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.6 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts; Third-Party Consents_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under this Agreement and any applicable Laws, including the HSR Act
and Gaming Laws, to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the
Boyd Purchase Agreement and the GLPI Purchase Agreement (the "Divestiture
Transactions"), including (A) the preparation and filing of all applications,

Decision and Order (Docket No. 9355) issued by the Federal Trade Commission to
the CompanyÂ’s predecessor on December 4, 2013, (B) the preparation of any

Merger and the Divestiture Transactions, (D) the defending of any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this

Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, (E) the
taking of all actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating with each other in
obtaining) as promptly as practicable any consent, authorization, Order or
approval of, or any exemption by, or to avoid an investigation, action,
proceeding or other challenge of the legality of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by, any Governmental Entity (which actions shall include
furnishing all information and documentary material required by any Gaming
Authority) required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the
Divestiture Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, "Approvals"), and (F) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger or the
Divestiture Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. Additionally, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and any of
their respective Affiliates shall not take any action after the date of this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the
obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period pursuant to the HSR Act, or any
other Approval, including Gaming Approvals, necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or the Divestiture Transactions, (ii)
increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an injunction or Order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the
Divestiture Transactions or (iii) increase the risk of not being able to
remove any such injunction or Order on appeal or otherwise.

 



 

(b) Without liming the generality of ParentÂ’s and the CompanyÂ’s undertakings
pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_, Parent and its Affiliates shall, take any and
all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Law or Gaming Law that may be asserted by any antitrust or
competition Governmental Entity or Gaming Authority so as to enable the
Parties to close the Merger as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior
to the

 



      
 

 



 

End Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise (i) the sale, divestiture
or disposition of its or its Subsidiaries assets, properties or businesses or

which shall include the Boyd Divestiture Businesses and the GLPI Divestiture
Assets, (ii) the holding separate of particular assets or placing operating
properties in trust upon the Closing pending obtaining control upon subsequent
receipt of Approval from applicable Gaming Authority or Governmental Entity
pursuant to applicable Antitrust Laws or Gaming Laws and (iii) the entry into
such other arrangements, agreements or amendments as are necessary or
advisable in order to obtain any required Approvals or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period pursuant to the HSR Act and to
avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby as soon as possible (and in any event before
the End Date); _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this Agreement shall require Parent to propose, agree or take any action
that would require Parent, to sell, divest, dispose of, hold separate, place
in trust, or enter into any other arrangement, agreement or amendment with
respect to any assets, properties or businesses in addition to the Boyd
Divestiture Businesses and the GLPI Divestiture Assets, if such additional
actions would have or would be reasonably expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition
or results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
after giving effect to the consummation of both the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by the Boyd Purchase Agreement and the GLPI Purchase
Agreement.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of _Section
5.6(a)_, each Party agrees to make promptly but in no event later than fifteen
(15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement an appropriate and
complete filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to supply as
promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entities any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act. Neither Party shall extend any waiting period under the HSR
Act without, or enter into any agreement with the Federal Trade Commission or
the United States Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity that
would restrain, delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement except with, the prior written consent of the
other Parties hereto (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 



 

(d) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Merger and the Divestiture
Transactions and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required
Approvals undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 5.6_. In
that regard, prior to the Closing, each Party shall promptly consult with the
other Parties to this Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary
information with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the
other Parties (or their counsel) copies of), all filings made by such Party
with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such Party
to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger, or the Divestiture Transactions. Each Party to this
Agreement shall promptly inform the other Parties to this Agreement, and if in
writing, furnish the other Party with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the other Party

 



      
 

 



 

orally of) any communication from any Governmental Entity or third party
regarding the Merger or the Divestiture Transactions, or any proposed
agreement or arrangement with any Governmental Entity or third party in
connection with the Merger or the Divestiture Transactions, and permit the
other Party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other Party in connection with, any proposed communication, or
proposed agreement or arrangement, with any such Governmental Entity or third
party. Neither Party shall participate in any meeting or teleconference with
any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Merger, or the
Divestiture Transactions unless it consults with the other Party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and applicable Law,
gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat
(whether by telephone or in person). Each Party shall furnish the other Party
with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental
Entity or third party with respect to this Agreement, the Merger, or the
Divestiture Transactions and furnish the other Party with such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other Party may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions
of information to any such Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials provided pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ may be redacted (i) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company, the Merger, or the
Divestiture Transactions or other confidential information, (ii) as necessary
to comply with contractual arrangements or applicable Laws, and (iii) as
necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns, and the Parties may
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive or any confidential business
material provided to the other under this _Section 5.6(d)_ as "counsel only"
or, as appropriate, as "outside counsel only".

 



 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of _Section
5.5(b)_, Parent and Merger Sub agree to, and agree to cause their Affiliates
and their respective directors, officers, partners, managers, members,
principals and shareholders to, and the Company agrees to prepare and submit
to the Gaming Authorities as promptly as practicable, and in any event no
later than forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of this Agreement, all
applications and supporting documents necessary to obtain all required Gaming
Approvals.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall determine
the strategy to be pursued for obtaining and lead any efforts to obtain all
necessary actions or nonactions and Approvals from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger, the Divestiture Transactions, or other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that Parent shall, in
good faith, take into consideration the CompanyÂ’s views, suggestions and
comments regarding such strategy and efforts; _provided_ , _further_ , that
such strategy and efforts shall not involve the CompanyÂ’s initiation, or the
CompanyÂ’s threatening to initiate, litigation against any Gaming Authority
without the CompanyÂ’s consent.

 



 

(g) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain, and Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with Parent and its Affiliates in their efforts to
obtain, any third party consent or approval (other than the Approvals)
(collectively, "Third Party Consents") that are necessary or desirable for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Third
Party Agreements; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this

 



       
 

 



 

Agreement, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to
obtain any Third Party Consents, or pay any fees in connection therewith,
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) the conditions to the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in _Section 6.3_
shall not be deemed to include the obtaining of any Third Party Consents.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or
"business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-
takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may purport to be, applicable to
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, the Company shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that
the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange, each Party shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or public statement with respect to the Merger or the
transactions contemplated thereby and, subject to the requirements of
applicable Law or the rules of any securities exchange, shall not issue any
such press release or public statement prior to such consultation. Parent and
the Company agree to issue a materially acceptable initial joint press release
announcing this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or
its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate of incorporation
or bylaws or other organizational documents or in any agreement shall survive
the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six
(6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain in effect (to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law) any
and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of
the CompanyÂ’s and any of its SubsidiariesÂ’ certificate of incorporation and
bylaws or similar organizational documents in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (to the extent and for so long as such entities remain in
existence following the Effective Time) or in any indemnification agreements
of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective current or
former directors, officers or employees in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions or the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses
provisions of the Surviving CorporationÂ’s organizational documents in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals
who immediately before the Effective Time were current or former directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to indemnification and exculpation in respect of
any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the
foregoing) each current and former director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director,
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (each, together with such personÂ’s heirs, executors or
administrators, an "Indemnified Party"), in each case against any costs or
expenses (including advancing attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking consistent with the Company Organizational
Documents and applicable Law to repay such amounts if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an
"Action"), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission by them in their capacities as such occurring or alleged to have
occurred whether commenced before or after the Effective Time (including any
matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
including acts or omissions in connection with such Indemnified Party serving
as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary of any entity if such
service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company). In the event of
any such Action, the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action.

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directorsÂ’
and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect
as of the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies for the Company and its current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage in effect as of the date
hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than
the existing coverage and have other terms not less favorable to the insured
persons than the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance coverage with respect to matters existing or arising on or
before the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company
prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverages (the "Maximum Amount")
required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall be obligated
to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage possible that does not exceed
300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof.
If (i) the Company elects, with the prior written consent of Parent, or (ii)
Parent elects, then the Company or Parent, as applicable, may at ParentÂ’s
cost, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective
Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified
Parties in their capacity as such; _provided_ that in no event shall the cost
of such policy, if purchased by the Company, exceed the Maximum Amount and, if
such a "tail policy" is purchased, Parent shall have no further obligations
under this _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _5.9(c)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the costs incurred from the purchase of
any "tail policy" shall be the responsibility of, and paid by, Parent.

 



 

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.9_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party shall be in addition to, and not in
limitation of, any other applicable rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.

 



 

(f) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated, amended or modified in any manner so
as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party (including their successors,
heirs and legal representatives) to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies without
the consent of such Indemnified Party. It is expressly agreed that,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the
contrary, (i) the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies
shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_ and (ii) this
_Section 5.9_ shall survive consummation of the Merger and shall be
enforceable by such Indemnified Parties and their respective successors, heirs
and legal representatives against Parent and the Surviving Corporation and
their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

(g) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.9_.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any PartyÂ’s
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other PartyÂ’s
operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries operations.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of shares of Parent Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the Merger by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent,
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.12 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall provide Parent with
the opportunity to participate in the CompanyÂ’s defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or executive
officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to
settle any such litigation commenced prior to or after the date of this
Agreement that contemplates any equitable relief or that would reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Nasdaq Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Company Indebtedness_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, timely deliver all
notices and take all other actions required to facilitate the termination of
commitments, repayment in full of all outstanding loans or other obligations,
release of any Liens securing such loans or obligations and guarantees in
connection therewith, and replacement of, backstop of, rollover of or cash
collateralization of any issued letters of credit in respect of that certain
Credit Agreement, dated as of April 28, 2016, by and among the Company, as
borrower, the Subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, the financial
institutions party thereto as lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
administrative agent and collateral agent (the "Company Credit Agreement," and
such termination and repayment, the "Company Credit Agreement Payoff") on the
Closing Date ( _provided_ that the Company Credit Agreement Payoff shall not
include contingent indemnity obligations in respect of which no claim or
demand for payment has been made as of the Closing Date or any other
obligation which is not due as of the Closing Date and by its terms survives
termination of the Company Credit Agreement (such indemnity and other
surviving obligations, the "Surviving Obligations")). In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent and Merger Sub no later than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date payoff letters with respect
to the Company Credit Agreement (the "Payoff Letter") in form and substance
customary for transactions of this type, from the persons to whom such
indebtedness is owed (or the applicable agent or trustee on their behalf)
which Payoff Letter together with any related release documentation shall,
among other things, include the payoff amount and provide that Liens (and
guarantees), if any, granted in connection therewith relating to the assets,
rights and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing such
Indebtedness and any other obligations secured thereby (other than, with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries other than the Divestiture
Subsidiaries, the guarantees of the Surviving Obligations), shall, upon the
payment of the amount set forth in the Payoff Letter on or prior to the
Closing Date, be released and terminated; provided that in no event shall this
_Section 5.14(a)_, (A) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
cause the Company Credit Agreement Payoff unless the Closing has occurred or
(B) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide any funds
required to effect any or all such repayments (including the Company Credit
Agreement Payoff) and related

 



      
 

 



 

replacement of, backstop of, rollover of, or cash collateralization of, any
issued letters of credit under the Company Credit Agreement.

 



 

(b) If requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (i) issue one or more notices of optional redemption (in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent) for all of the outstanding
aggregate principal amount of any of the CompanyÂ’s 5.625% Senior Notes due
2024 (the "Company Notes"), in accordance with the Note Indenture in order to
effect a redemption on (or at the ParentÂ’s sole option, after) the Closing
Date; _provided_ that any such redemption notice shall be subject to and
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time and (ii) provide any
other cooperation reasonably requested by Parent (which shall not require the
payment of funds by the Company or its Subsidiaries towards the Discharge) to
facilitate (to the extent elected by Parent) the Discharge effective as of (or
at the ParentÂ’s sole option, after), and conditioned upon the occurrence of,
the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall
promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred by the Company in connection with the cooperation
with Parent contemplated by this _Section 5.14 _and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with any Discharge or
satisfaction and discharge of the Note Indenture (or failure to Discharge or
satisfy and discharge, as the case may be) requested by Parent hereunder and
any information used in connection therewith, except to the extent such
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses arise from the bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of
their Representatives or arise from or are based upon any information provided
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives specifically for
use in connection with the Discharge. Parent shall provide forms reasonably
satisfactory to the Company of any documentation required to affect any action
pursuant to this _Section 5.14_.

 



 

(d) Parent shall (i) subject to the CompanyÂ’s satisfaction of its obligations
under Section 5.14(a), cause the Company Credit Agreement Payoff to occur on
the Closing Date and (ii) subject to the CompanyÂ’s satisfaction of its
obligations under Section 5.14(b), either (A) deliver a certificate from the
chief financial officer of Parent reasonably satisfactory to the Company that
states that the Company Notes shall remain outstanding following the Closing
Date and such action shall not cause (x) a "default" or "event of default" to
exist under the Note Indenture or (y) otherwise cause an obligation to prepay
(or offer to prepay) such Company Notes to be triggered, unless, in the cause
of this clause (y), Parent has adequate liquidity to make any such prepayment
(or offer of prepayment) or (B) cause Discharge of all of the Company Notes on
the Closing Date or the satisfaction and discharge of the Note Indenture on
the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly notify the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (a) has had or is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with
all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, in the case of the Company, or Parent

 



      
 

 



 

Material Adverse Effect, in the case of Parent, or a material adverse effect
on the Boyd Divestiture Businesses, the Divestiture Subsidiaries or their
assets or liabilities, taken as a whole, or (b) would cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein; _provided_ that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing with respect to any change or event shall not be
deemed to constitute a violation of this _Section 5.15_ or the failure of any
condition set forth in _Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_ to be satisfied, or
otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the Party failing to give
such notice, in each case unless the underlying change or event would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in _Section
6.2_ or _Section 6.3_ to be satisfied.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the later of
December 31, 2019 and the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent
(or its applicable Affiliate) shall provide to each employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date who remains employed by Parent or its
Affiliates (each, a "Continuing Employee"): (i) at least the same base salary
that was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date; (ii) short- and long-term incentive opportunities that are substantially
as favorable in the aggregate and containing the same percentage mix of short-
and long-term incentive opportunities as the short- and long-term incentive
opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date; and (iii) other compensation and employee benefits (excluding
those contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii) and severance (which is covered in
_Section 5.16(b)_) that are substantially as favorable in the aggregate to
the compensation and benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, if the Effective Time occurs
prior to the commencement of the CompanyÂ’s and ParentÂ’s annual benefit plan
open enrollment periods, Parent may instead provide Continuing Employees with
health and welfare benefits that it provides to its similarly situated
employees. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
continue any annual or short-term incentive plans with performance periods
that are incomplete as of the Closing Date until the end of the applicable
performance periods in accordance with the terms of the applicable annual or
short-term incentive plans.

 



 

(b) Any Continuing Employee who incurs a qualifying termination of employment
during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the later of
December 31, 2019 and the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date shall be
entitled to receive the severance payments and benefits described in _Section
5.16(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or severance benefits contained in
such Continuing EmployeeÂ’s employment agreement, as applicable.

 



 

(c) Each individual who is employed by the Company or any of its Affiliates as
of immediately prior to the Closing and is a participant in a cash bonus
program maintained by the Company or any of its Affiliates for the year in
which the Closing occurs shall be eligible to receive a cash bonus based on
the level of achievement of the applicable performance criteria determined
prior to the Closing by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board of
Directors in its reasonable discretion (as further described in _Section
5.16(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter), which bonus shall be prorated
based on the number of days in the applicable performance period that have
elapsed as of the Closing. Any such bonus shall be paid to the

 



      
 

 



 

applicable employee on the Closing Date (in each case, unless prohibited by
Section 409A of the Code, in which event, it shall be paid on the earliest
date permitted by Section 409A of the Code).

 



 

(d) Parent shall, and shall cause any of their applicable Affiliates to (i)
waive all limitations as to any preexisting condition or waiting periods in
its applicable welfare plans with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to each Continuing Employee under any welfare plans
that such Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate in after the
Closing to the same extent such limitations were waived under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date and (ii) credit each Continuing
Employee for any copayments, deductibles, offsets or similar payments made
under a Company Benefit Plan during the plan year that includes the Closing
for purposes of satisfying any applicable copayment, deductible, offset or
similar requirements under the comparable plans of Parent or any of its
Affiliates to the same extent such copayments, deductibles, offsets or similar
payments would be credited under the analogous Company Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date. As of the Closing, Parent shall, or
shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, credit to Continuing Employees the
amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under any applicable
Company Benefit Plan as of the Closing, in each case, insofar as not
prohibited by applicable Law. In addition, as of the Closing, Parent shall,
and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to give Continuing Employees full
credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of level of
benefits under any employee benefit and compensation plans or arrangements
(including for purposes of vacation and severance but excluding for any
purpose benefits under defined benefit plans, retiree medical plans, frozen or
grandfathered benefit plans or benefit plans under which similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Affiliates do not receive any service credit)
maintained by Parent or its applicable Affiliates that such Continuing
Employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing for such
Continuing EmployeesÂ’ service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
the same extent that such service was credited for purposes of any comparable
Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing, except, in each case,
to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative benefits.

 



 

(e) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Company to honor,
in accordance with their terms, all Company Benefit Plans. The occurrence of
the Closing shall be deemed to be a change in control (or a similar term)
under all Company Benefit Plans.

 



 

(f) If the Closing, as defined in Boyd Purchase Agreement, occurs prior to the
Effective Time, for purposes of this Agreement and all Company Long Term
Incentive Awards and cash bonus programs maintained by the Company or any of
its Affiliates for the year in which the Closing occurs (but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Company severance plan or any employment agreement),
each Continuing Employee, as defined in Boyd Purchase Agreement, shall be
deemed employed by the Company at the Effective Time.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or
other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, which rights are hereby
expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing
Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. In no
event shall the terms of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit
Plan, any Parent Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their Affiliates, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or Parent
Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms after the Closing Date. Without
limiting _Section 8.13_, nothing in this _Section 5.16_ shall create any
third party beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee or current or former
service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or
dependents thereof).

 



 

Section 5.17 _Financing Cooperation; Financing_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to,
at ParentÂ’s sole expense, provide to Parent such cooperation as is reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Financing (provided that such
requested cooperation (A) does not unreasonably interfere with the operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (B) does not cause any director, officer
or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Representatives
to incur any personal liability, (C) does not require that the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers or employees
execute, deliver or enter into or perform any agreement, document or

required in connection with the Financing (or any amendment to Parent Credit
Agreement), in each case, as may be reasonably required by Parent (subject to
customary confidentiality arrangements), (iii) as promptly as reasonably
practical, furnishing Parent and its Financing Sources (subject to customary
confidentiality arrangements) with financial and other information regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent in
good faith and that is customarily required to prepare any offering
memorandum, registration statement, confidential information memorandum,
lender presentation and other materials, customarily required in connection
with the Financing (including the Financing Information), (iv) furnishing to
Parent and the Financing Sources (A) all information regarding the Company and
its Subsidiaries required to be provided to ParentÂ’s Financing Sources
pursuant to paragraph (iii) of Schedule 1 of the Debt Financing Commitment as
in effect as of the date hereof (or comparable provisions of any commitment
for Alternate Financing), (B) the Financing Information and (C) the
documentation and other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries
that are required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-
customer" rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act, at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to the extent requested at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (v) using reasonable best

 



      
 

 



 

efforts, in the event the financing includes an offering of debt securities,
to obtain customary accountantsÂ’ comfort letters, consent letters and
authorization letters from the CompanyÂ’s independent accountants (including
"negative assurance" comfort) with respect to the financial information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries referenced in clause (iv)
(including providing any necessary management representation letters), (vi)
assisting Parent with ParentÂ’s preparation of pro forma financial information
and pro forma financial statements as they relate to the Company and its
Subsidiaries for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda,

thereby), (viii) facilitating the negotiation of customary certificates and
other documents and instruments relating to the Financing (which documents
shall only be required to become effective as of the Closing Date), (ix)
cooperating with Parent to obtain surveys and title insurance relating to the
CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ properties to be mortgaged in connection with
the Financing as may be requested by Parent in writing, (x) cooperating with
Parent and ParentÂ’s efforts to obtain customary corporate and facilities
ratings, (xi) providing customary authorization letters to the Financing
Sources and agents in respect of the Financing authorizing the distribution of
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to prospective
lenders and containing a representation to such financing sources that the
public side versions of such documents, if any, do not include material non-
public information about the Company or its Affiliates or its or their
securities.

 



 

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required, under
the provisions of this _Section 5.17_ or otherwise in connection with the
Financing (or any amendment to Parent Credit Agreement), (i) to pay any
commitment or other similar fee prior to the Effective Time or (ii) to incur
any cost or expense unless such cost or expense is promptly reimbursed by
Parent (and in any event no later than the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VII_). Parent shall indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection
with any action taken by them at the request of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant
to this _Section 5.17_ other than to the extent such losses arise from the
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives or arise from or relate to any
information provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives specifically for use in connection with the Financing (or any
amendment to Parent Credit Agreement). Nothing contained in this Section 5.17
or otherwise shall require the board of directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (as constituted prior to the Effective Time) to approve any
Financing or any Financing Agreement or other agreement related thereto.
Further, nothing contained in this Section or otherwise shall require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be an issuer or other obligor with
respect to any Financing prior to the Closing. All material non-public
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries provided to Parent,
Merger Sub or their respective Representatives pursuant to this _Section
5.17_ shall be kept confidential by them in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement except for disclosure to potential lenders and
investors and their respective officers, employees, representatives and
advisors as required in connection with any Financing subject to

 



      
 

 



 

confidentiality protections customary for such Financing. This _Section
5.17(b)_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the Effective Time
and any termination of this Agreement, and is intended to benefit, and may be
enforced by, the Company and its Subsidiaries (and the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries
shall be third party beneficiaries of ParentÂ’s obligations under this _Section
5.17(b)_), and their respective successors and assigns, and shall be binding
on Parent and its successors and assigns.

 



 

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
arrange, obtain and complete the Debt Financing on or before the Closing on
the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitment (as
amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or terminated in accordance with
_Section 5.17(d)_), including using reasonable best efforts to:

 



 

(i) comply with, subject to its rights in _Section 5.17(d)_, maintain in
effect the Debt Financing Commitment, and, once entered into, the Financing
Agreements with respect thereto;

 



 

(ii) negotiate Financing Agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment or on other
terms acceptable to Parent;

 



 

(iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the Debt
Financing in the Debt Financing Commitment and any Financing Agreements with
respect thereto; and

 



 

(iv) in the event of a failure to fund by the Lenders in accordance with the
Debt Financing Commitment that prevents, impedes or delays the Closing,
enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment and any Financing
Agreements with respect thereto.

 



 

(d) Parent shall not agree to any amendment, supplement or other modification
or replacement of, or any termination of the Debt Financing Commitment without
the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment, supplement,
modification, replacement, termination would (i) delay or prevent the Closing,
(ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, (iii) impose new or
additional conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, in each case, in a
manner that would adversely impact the ability of Parent to obtain the Debt
Financing on the Closing Date, or (iv) adversely impact in any material
respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the
other Parties to the Debt Financing Commitment; it being understood that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may (x) amend, supplement, modify,
replace or terminate the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date of this Agreement, and
(y) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing by the amount of (A) any
debt securities issued by the Parent in replacement of a portion of the Debt
Financing Commitment or (B) any incremental term loans obtained under the
Parent Credit Agreement issued under the Debt Financing Commitment (any such
financing, a "Permanent Financing," and together with the Debt Financing, the
"Financing"). Upon any amendment, supplement, modification, replacement or
termination of

 



       
 

 



 

the Debt Financing Commitment in accordance with this _Section 5.17(d)_,
Parent shall deliver a copy thereof to the Company (including any principal
documents entered into in connection with a Permanent Financing) and (i)
references herein to "Debt Financing Commitment" shall include such documents
as amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or terminated in compliance with
this _Section 5.17(d)_ (including any documents entered into in connection
with a Permanent Financing) and (ii) references to "Debt Financing" or
"Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment as amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or terminated in
compliance with this _Section 5.17(d)_ and by any Permanent Financing.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 5.17(d)_ above, in the event any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable (other than, for the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to any reduction of the Debt Financing Commitment in accordance
with _Section 5.17(d)(y) above)_, (i) Parent shall promptly notify the
Company and (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources (the "Alternate
Financing") (A) on conditions not less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than
the Debt Financing Commitment, (B) in an amount sufficient to replace the
portion of the Debt Financing that becomes unavailable and (C) other than as
set forth in (A) or (B), on terms not materially less beneficial to Parent or
Merger Sub. Copies of any new financing commitment letter (including any
associated engagement letter and related fee letter (with fee amount redacted
to the extent required by the applicable Financing Sources)) shall be promptly
provided to the Company. In the event any Alternate Financing is obtained in
accordance with this _Section 5.17_, any reference in this Agreement to "Debt
Financing Commitment" and "Debt Financing" shall include the debt financing
contemplated by such Alternate Financing. Except as provided elsewhere in this
_Section 5.17_ and subject to the limitations in _Section 5.17(d)_, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent from entering into Financing
Agreements relating to the Debt Financing.

 



 

(f) Parent shall (i) give the Company prompt written notice of any default,
breach or threatened breach in writing by any party of any of the Debt
Financing Commitment or Financing Agreements related thereto of which Parent
or Merger Sub become aware or any termination, or threatened termination in
writing thereof and (ii) otherwise, at the request of the Company, keep the
Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing (or any Permanent Financing or Alternate Financing).

 



 

(g) In the event any Financing is funded in advance of the Closing Date,
Parent, or its applicable Subsidiary, shall keep and maintain at all times
prior to the Closing Date the proceeds of such Financing available for the
purpose of funding the Cash Consideration and other amounts payable in cash at
Closing as set forth in this Agreement and such proceeds shall be maintained
as unrestricted cash or cash equivalents, free and clear of all Liens other
than (a) Permitted Liens referenced in clause (a) of the definition of
"Permitted Liens", (b) Liens granted pursuant to or in connection with the
Parent Credit Agreement and related documents, as in effect as of the date
hereof which are not subject to control agreements, and (c) bankersÂ’ Liens,
rights of setoff and other similar Liens granted in the ordinary course of
business in favor of the bank or banks with which such funds are deposited or
maintained, securing amounts owing to such bank with respect to cash
management and operating account arrangements; _provided_ that if the terms of
such Financing requires the proceeds of such Financing to be held in escrow
(or

 



      
 

 



 

similar arrangement) pending the consummation of the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement, then such proceeds may be held in escrow, solely to the
extent the conditions to the release of such funds are no more onerous (taken
as a whole) than the conditions to funding the Debt Financing Commitment.

 



 

(h) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining
of the Financing is not a condition to the Closing.

ensure that the conditions precedent set forth in Section 7.02 of the Parent

Section 5.18 _Third Party Agreements and Certain Pre-Closing Transactions_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges and agrees that
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Boyd Purchase
Agreement and the GLPI Purchase Agreement are not conditions to the Closing.
If the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VI_ of this Agreement
shall have been satisfied (or, in the case of conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied at the Closing, shall be capable of being satisfied) or
waived, but the conditions to closing set forth in the Boyd Purchase Agreement
or the GLPI Purchase Agreement have not been satisfied or waived by the
applicable parties thereunder, or the parties thereunder are otherwise not
able to or willing to close the transactions contemplated thereunder, the
Parties shall proceed with the Closing in accordance with _Section 1.2_, and
in no event shall the Closing of the Merger be delayed, impaired, hindered or
otherwise adversely affected by any delay or failure to close the transactions
contemplated by the Boyd Purchase Agreement or the GLPI Purchase Agreement by
the parties thereto.

 



 

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to
closing conditions set forth in each of the Boyd Purchase Agreement and the
GLPI Purchase Agreement to be satisfied or waived as promptly as reasonably
practicable, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with and assist Parent in doing so, which cooperation includes,
following reasonable advance notice from Parent, taking such actions expressly
contemplated to be performed or provided by or on behalf of the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries by the Boyd Purchase Agreement and the GLPI Purchase
Agreement in the forms

 



      
 

 



 

provided to the Company as of the date hereof (and without giving effect to
any actions or deliverables added by an amendment to such agreements to which
the Company has not consented, provided that the Company shall not
unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent thereto if reasonably
requested by Parent) and providing such other cooperation and assistance as
Parent shall reasonably request in connection therewith. No Party shall take
any action that would reasonably be expected to delay, impair, hinder or
otherwise adversely affect the ability of the parties to the Boyd Purchase
Agreement or the GLPI Purchase Agreement to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Boyd Purchase Agreement or the GLPI Purchase Agreement.
Parent shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other
modification or replacement of, or any termination of, or grant any waiver of,
any condition or other provision under any Third Party Agreement without the
prior written consent of the Company if such amendment, supplement,
modification, replacement, termination, or waiver would or would reasonably be
expected to (i) delay or prevent the closing of the transactions contemplated
by the Boyd Purchase Agreement, the GLPI Purchase Agreement or the Merger,
(ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify
any of the conditions to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the
Boyd Purchase Agreement and the GLPI Purchase Agreement or (iii) adversely
affect in any material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the failure of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or its or their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents or representatives) to execute, deliver or
perform, or cause to execute, deliver or perform, any instruments, documents
or actions in connection with the Divestiture Transactions, whether requested
by Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.18_ or pursuant to the Boyd Purchase
Agreement or GLPI Purchase Agreement, constitute a breach or failure to
perform by the Company of any of its covenants contained in this Agreement, so
long as the Company has engaged in good faith and reasonable efforts to
execute, deliver or perform (or to cause its Subsidiaries or request its or
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives to
do so) such instruments, documents or actions, as applicable.

 



 

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Parent and
Boyd in obtaining any necessary authorization, consent and approval in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Boyd Purchase Agreement
or the GLPI Purchase Agreement, as applicable. If requested by Parent, the
Company and any applicable Divestiture Subsidiaries shall execute and deliver
a joinder agreement to each of the Boyd Purchase Agreement and the GLPI
Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company and such Divestiture
Subsidiaries shall become parties to each such agreement as of immediately
prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any of the Divestiture Subsidiaries are
making any representations or warranties or will be bound by any covenants,
obligations or agreements under the Boyd Purchase Agreement or the GLPI
Purchase Agreement until, and only at or following, such time as the Company
and the applicable Divestiture Subsidiaries have executed and delivered a
joinder agreement to the Boyd Purchase Agreement or the GLPI Purchase
Agreement, as applicable.

 



 

(d) For purposes of facilitating the transactions contemplated by the Boyd
Purchase Agreement and the GLPI Purchase Agreement, at ParentÂ’s reasonable
request the Company shall afford (i) the officers and employees and (ii) the
accountants, consultants, legal

 



      
 

 



 

counsel, financial advisors, financing sources and agents and other
representatives of each of Boyd and GLPI such reasonable access during normal
business hours, throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective
Time and the Termination Date, to its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ personnel and
properties, contracts, commitments, books and records and any report, schedule
or other document filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of
applicable Laws, and with such additional accounting, operating, environmental
and other data and information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, to
the extent in the possession of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as Parent may
reasonably request, in each case solely with respect to the Boyd Divestiture
Businesses in the case of Boyd and the GLPI Divestiture Assets in the case of
GLPI, subject to the same terms and conditions such access would be provided
to Parent and it Representatives under _Section 5.2_.

 



 

(e) Upon the written request of Parent, which request shall be provided at
least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to implement, prior to the Closing, such internal
restructuring transactions as may be reasonably necessary to facilitate the
completion of the Divestiture Transactions in the manner contemplated by Boyd
Purchase Agreement and the GLPI Purchase Agreement, respectively (such
restructuring transactions, to the extent undertaken in accordance with this
_Section 5.18(e)_, the "Internal Restructuring"). The Company shall have no
obligation to complete any restructuring step that would result in any cost
(unless advanced by Parent), liability or obligation unless Parent and Merger
Sub confirm in writing satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to Closing set
forth in _Article VI_ of this Agreement and are prepared to proceed with the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, any actions taken by the Company pursuant
to this _Section 5.18(e)_ shall be subject to the indemnity contemplated by
_Section 5.18(f)_.

 



 

(f) Parent shall advance or promptly reimburse the Company in respect of any
fee, cost, expense or obligations undertaken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Internal Restructuring (to the extent
undertaken) or any of the Third Party Agreements or the transactions
contemplated thereby as contemplated by this _Section 5.18_. Whether or not
the Closing occurs, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
losses, taxes, costs, expenses, fees, damages or liabilities suffered or
incurred by them in connection with any action taken by them at the request of
Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this _Section 5.18_, under any of the Third
Party Agreements or in connection with, arising out of or relating to the
Internal Restructuring or any of the Third Party Agreements or the
transactions contemplated thereby, other than to the extent such losses arise
directly from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

 **ARTICLE VII**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION_**

 



 

Section 7.1 _Termination or Abandonment_. Notwithstanding anything in this

any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained (except as otherwise provided below):

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 



 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or prior to October 31, 2018; _provided_ that if (i) on October
31, 2018, either (x) the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_
or _Section 6.1(e)_ shall not have been satisfied but all other conditions to
Closing shall have been satisfied (or in the case of conditions that by their

that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_
shall not be available to a Party if the failure of the Closing to occur by
such date shall be due to the material breach by such Party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of such Party set forth
in this Agreement;

 



 

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if an injunction shall have been entered
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the Merger and such injunction shall have become final and nonappealable;

(including any adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have concluded and
the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained;

perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) if it
occurred or was continuing to occur on the Closing Date, would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ and
(ii) by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date or, if such breach
or failure is capable of being cured by the End Date, Parent has not cured
such breach or failure within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice
from the Company describing such breach or failure in reasonable detail (

(g) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of

condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ and (ii) by its
nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date or, if such breach or failure is
capable of being cured by the End Date, the Company has not cured such breach

(j) by the Company, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a Company
Superior Proposal pursuant to _Section 5.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph,
unless in advance of or concurrently with such termination the Company pays,
or causes to be paid, the Company Termination Fee as provided in _Section

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, notice thereof shall be given to the
other Party or Parties, specifying the provisions hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made and the basis therefor described in reasonable
detail, and this Agreement shall terminate (except for the provisions of
_Section 5.14(c)_, _Section 5.17(b)_, _Section 5.18(f)_, this _Section
7.2_, _Section 7.3_ and _Article VIII_), and there shall be no other

in the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of _Section 5.14(c)_,
_Section 5.17(b)_, _Section 5.18(f)_, this _Section 7.2_ and _Section

Section 7.3 _Termination Fee; Expenses_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ in the event of a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change; or

 



 

(ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(j)_; or

 



 

(iii) (A) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ hereof, (B) a
Company Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced or shall have
become publicly known and shall not have been publicly withdrawn by a date
that is at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Company StockholdersÂ’
Meeting and (C) within twelve (12) months of the termination of this
Agreement, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive
agreement with a third party with respect to or consummates a transaction that
is a Company Takeover Proposal with a third party;

 



 

then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire
transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in immediately available funds
in the case of clause (i), within two (2) Business Days of such termination,
or, in the case of clause (ii), at or prior to such termination, or, in the
case of clause (iii), upon the earlier of the entry into a definitive
agreement with respect to the transactions contemplated by such Company
Takeover Proposal and the consummation of such transactions.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(i)_ in the event of a Parent Adverse recommendation Change, then Parent
shall pay to the Company promptly (but in any event no later than the second
Business Day after such termination), the Parent Termination Fee.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ in
connection with any injunction, order, decree or ruling relating to Antitrust
Laws or Gaming Laws, including the Gaming Approvals; or

 



 

(ii) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ and at the
time of such termination, any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_
(if the applicable injunction, order, decree or ruling relates to Antitrust

shall not have been satisfied and the conditions in _Section 6.1(a)_(i),
_Section 6.3(a)_, _Section 6.3(b)_, _Section 6.3(c)_ and _Section 6.3(d)_
have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied at or prior to the
Closing;

 



 

then Parent shall pay to the Company promptly (but in any event no later than
the second Business Day after such termination), the Parent Regulatory
Termination Fee; _provided_ that Parent shall not be obligated to pay the
Parent Regulatory Termination Fee in the event of a termination by Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(c)_ if the injunction or the
failure to close by the End Date allowing Parent to so terminate was

 



      
 

 



 

primarily due to the material breach by the Company of any representation,
warranty or covenant of the Company set forth in _Section 3.7_, _Section
5.6_ or _Section 5.18_ hereof.

 



 

(d) _Expense Payments_.

 



 

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 7.1(d)_, the Company shall pay Parent $30,000,000 as payment for

Parent) in immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days after such
termination.

 



 

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 7.1(e)_, the Parent shall pay Company $60,000,000 as payment for
CompanyÂ’s costs and expenses in connection with this Agreement (the "Company
Expense Payment", and together with the Parent Expense Payment, the "Expense
Payments") by wire transfer (to an account designated in writing by the
Company) in immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days after
such termination.

 



 

(e) "Parent Termination Fee" shall be an amount equal to $60,000,000. "Company
Termination Fee" shall be an amount equal to $60,000,000. "Parent Regulatory
Termination Fee" shall be an amount equal to $125,000,000.

 



 

(f) The payment of the Parent Termination Fee, the Parent Regulatory
Termination Fee, the Company Termination Fee, as applicable (in each case, a
"Termination Fee Payment") and the Expense Payments shall be compensation and
liquidated damages for the loss suffered by the Company or Parent, as
applicable, as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated and to
avoid the difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances and
neither Party shall have any other liability to the other after the payment of
such Termination Fee Payment or Expense Payment, except in the case of fraud
or a Willful and Material Breach. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, if the Termination Fee Payment shall become due and payable in
accordance with _Section 7.3(a)_, _Section 7.3(b)_ or _Section 7.3(c)_, as
applicable, from and after such termination and payment of the Termination Fee
Payment pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 7.3(a)_, _Section
7.3(b)_ or _Section 7.3(c)_, as applicable, the paying Party shall have no
further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement
or the termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under _Section
7.3(a)_, _Section 7.3(b)_ or _Section 7.3(c)_, as applicable, except in the
case of fraud or a Willful and Material Breach. Each of the Parties hereto
acknowledges that the Termination Fee Payment and Expense Payments are not
intended to be a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Company or Parent, as the case may be, in the
circumstances in which such Termination Fee Payment and/or Expense Payment is
due and payable and which do not involve fraud or Willful and Material Breach,
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event
shall any Party be entitled to more than one payment of the Termination Fee
Payment in connection with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which
the Termination Fee Payment is payable, and if the Termination Fee Payment is
payable at such time as the receiving Party has

 



       
 

 



 

already received payment or concurrently receives payment from the paying
Party in respect of the Parent Expense Payment or the Company Expense Payment,
as applicable, the amount of such Parent Expense Payment or the Company
Expense Payment actually received by Parent or the Company, as applicable,
shall be deducted from the Termination Fee Payment due and payable to such
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event Parent is required to pay
both the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent Regulatory Termination Fee
pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, Parent shall be required to pay to the
Company only the Parent Regulatory Termination Fee. Solely for purposes of
this _Section 7.3_, "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning
ascribed thereto in _Section 8.15(b)(xi)_, except that all references to 15%
shall be changed to 50.1%.

 



 

(g) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if a Party fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due
pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, then such Party shall reimburse the other
Party for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees
of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in
connection with any related Actions commenced and pay interest on such amount
from and including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding
the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

Section 8.1 _No Survival_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall survive the Merger, except for covenants and agreements

Section 8.5 _Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur (for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy) in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed (including failing
to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), or were threatened to be not
performed, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy that may be
available to it, including monetary damages, each of the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company causing Parent to comply
with its obligations pursuant to _Section 5.17(c)_) exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware) and all such rights and remedies at law or in equity shall
be cumulative, except as may be limited by _Section 7.3_. Each of the Parties
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has
an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. The Parties further
agree that no Party to this Agreement shall be required to obtain, secure,
furnish or post any

 



      
 

 



 

bond, security or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.5_ and each Party waives
any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to
require the obtaining, securing, furnishing or posting of any such bond,
security or similar instrument. In addition, each of the Parties hereto
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition
and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its
successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware). Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with
regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its
property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above named courts, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, each of the Parties hereto hereby consents to the service of process in
accordance with _Section 8.7_; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Parties
agrees on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries that it and its Subsidiaries
will not bring or support any legal action or proceeding, whether in Law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise against the Financing
Sources and their respective current, former or future directors, officers,
general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, controlling
persons, Affiliates, employees or advisors in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York or, if such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, in any state court located in the City and County of New York.

 



 

Section 8.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING (WHETHER AT LAW, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT
OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO

 



      
 

 



 

THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE).

Section 8.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated
by any of the Parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other
Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Merger Sub and Parent may

unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

a duly authorized representative of each of the Company, Parent and Merger

Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law or in
accordance with the rules and regulations of Nasdaq require further approval
of the stockholders of the Company, the effectiveness of such amendment or
waiver shall be subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any Party hereto in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any

8.6_, this sentence of _Section 8.11_, and the proviso of the first sentence
