Baseline Inventory Value"). The PB4 Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the
difference between the PB4 Baseline Inventory Value and the aggregate value of

Value"). The PB4 Closing Inventory Value shall be determined in the same
manner as the PB4 Baseline Inventory Value (i.e., based on the lower of cost

not all, of the Common Facilities Major Maintenance Spares at the Closing in
accordance with Section 2.21(f), twenty-five percent (25%) of the price
mutually agreed to by the Project Purchasers and Seller for such Common
Facilities Major Maintenance Spares.

(ad)The Parties acknowledge and agree that there is no PB1 Purchased
Inventory, PB2 Purchased Inventory, PB3 Purchased Inventory or PB4 Purchased
Inventory other than the twenty-five percent (25%) undivided interest in the
Common Facilities Inventory and, as such, all adjustments to the Purchase 

Price under clauses (a), (c), (e) and (g) of this Section 3.5 shall be made on
the basis of the value of such Common Facilities Inventory.

not be responsible or liable for or receive any amount under this Section 3.6
that constitutes a PB4 Excluded Liability, a PB4 Excluded Asset, a Common

receipt of the applicable Estimated Closing Statement(s), such Purchaser shall
provide to Seller its good faith objections, if any, to the Estimated Closing
Adjustments in writing. If any Purchaser objects to any Estimated Closing
Adjustment within such period, Seller and such Purchaser shall attempt to
resolve their differences by good faith negotiation. If such Purchaser and

Adjustment, the PB3 Purchase Price shall be adjusted at the Closing by the

shall prepare and deliver to Seller a final closing statement (the statement
related to the PB1 Purchase Price, the "PB1 Post-Closing Statement", the
statement related to the PB2 Purchase Price, the "PB2 Post-Closing Statement",
the statement related to the PB3 Purchase Price, the "PB3 Post‑Closing

determination of all adjustments to the PB1 Purchase Price, the PB2 Purchase
Price, the PB3 Purchase Price and the PB4 Purchase Price, as applicable,
required by this Agreement to be made as of the Closing to the extent not
reflected in the PB1 Estimated Purchase Price, the PB2 Estimated Purchase

however, that any post-Closing adjustment with respect to a Proratable Tax
Item or another item for which a Purchaser, despite its use of Commercially
Reasonable Efforts, has not received the information necessary for
determination of the actual adjustment shall be made on or before thirty (30)
days after such Purchaser\'s receipt of the information necessary to render a
final post-Closing adjustment for such Proratable Tax Item or other item and
shall otherwise be subject to the procedures set forth in this Section 3.8.
Each Post-Closing Statement shall be prepared using the identical (when
possible) or substantially the same (when not) accounting principles,
policies, methods and procedures as Seller used in connection with the
calculation or determination of the items reflected on the applicable
Estimated Closing Statement.

(am)Each Party shall furnish promptly, and cause its Representatives to
furnish promptly, to any other Party and its Representatives any and all
documents, material, data and other information reasonably requested by such
other Party in connection with the calculation or determination of any item
reflected (or that should have been reflected) in any Estimated Closing
Adjustment or Post-Closing Statement, as applicable, and, to the extent
reasonably necessary, allow prompt, reasonable access of such other Party and
its Representatives to programs and software used to prepare the Estimated
Closing Adjustments, the Post-Closing Statements and information relating
thereto.

(an)On or before thirty (30) days after the applicable Purchaser\'s delivery
of the Post-Closing Statements to Seller, Seller may object in good faith to
any Proposed Post‑Closing Adjustment in writing, stating in reasonable detail
each of its objections thereto and the basis therefor and its proposed
calculation of any disputed adjustment. If and to the extent Seller does not
dispute or timely object to an amount in, as applicable (i) the PB1 Proposed
Post‑Closing Adjustment, the PB1 Estimated Purchase Price shall be further
adjusted (the "PB1 Initial Post-Closing Adjustment") by the amount in the PB1
Proposed Post-Closing Adjustment not in dispute or not timely objected to,

Price shall be further adjusted (the "PB2 Initial Post-Closing Adjustment") by
the amount in the PB2 Proposed Post-Closing Adjustment not in dispute or not
timely objected to, (iii) the PB3 Proposed Post-Closing Adjustment, the PB3
Estimated Purchase Price shall be further adjusted (the "PB3 Initial Post-
Closing Adjustment") by the amount in the PB3 Proposed Post-Closing Adjustment

Closing Adjustment, the PB4 Estimated Purchase Price shall be further adjusted
(the "PB4 Initial Post-Closing Adjustment") by the amount in the PB4 Proposed
Post-Closing Adjustment not in dispute or not timely objected to. Each Initial
Post-Closing Adjustment shall be effective as of the earlier of the date a
Purchaser receives Seller\'s written objections to such Proposed Post-Closing
Adjustment or the date such objections are due and not provided.

(ao)If Seller objects in good faith to a Proposed Post-Closing Adjustment as
provided above, Seller and the applicable Purchaser shall attempt to resolve
all such objections by good faith negotiation. If Seller and the applicable
Purchaser are able to resolve any such objection with respect to (i) the PB1
Proposed Post-Closing Adjustment, the PB1 Purchase Price shall be promptly
adjusted, (ii) the PB2 Proposed Post-Closing Adjustment, the PB2 Purchase
Price shall be promptly adjusted, (iii) the PB3 Proposed Post-Closing
Adjustment, the PB3 Purchase Price shall be promptly adjusted or (iv) the PB4
Proposed Post-Closing Adjustment, the PB4 Purchase Price shall be promptly

Seller and the applicable Purchaser are unable to resolve any such 

objection after the lapse of forty-five (45) days after such Purchaser\'s
delivery to Seller of each Proposed Post-Closing Adjustment, then Seller or
the applicable Purchaser may submit in writing its proposed adjustments of the
PB1 Estimated Purchase Price, the PB2 Estimated Purchase Price, the PB3
Estimated Purchase Price or the PB4 Estimated Purchase Price, as applicable,
to the Independent Accounting Firm. Each such proposed adjustment shall be
materially in accordance with the most recent proposed adjustment made by such
Party to the other Party during their good faith negotiations over the item in
dispute. In addition, Seller and the applicable Purchaser shall submit such
calculations, materials, memoranda, arguments, briefs and evidence in support
of their respective positions, and in accordance with such procedures, as the
Independent Accounting Firm may require or determine.

(ap)On or before twenty (20) Business Days following the due date of such
submissions, as to each adjustment of the PB1 Estimated Purchase Price, the
PB2 Estimated Purchase Price, the PB3 Estimated Purchase Price or the PB4
Estimated Purchase Price, as applicable, in dispute, the Independent
Accounting Firm shall select, for each adjustment of the PB1 Estimated
Purchase Price, the PB2 Estimated Purchase Price, the PB3 Estimated Purchase
Price or the PB4 Estimated Purchase Price, as applicable, in dispute, an
adjustment of the PB1 Estimated Purchase Price, the PB2 Estimated Purchase
Price, the PB3 Estimated Purchase Price or the PB4 Estimated Purchase Price,
as applicable, proposed by one of the Parties. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall have no authority to alter any such proposal in any way absent manifest
error. Each such determination by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the applicable Parties as to such adjustments
of the PB1 Estimated Purchase Price, the PB2 Estimated Purchase Price, the PB3
Estimated Purchase Price or the PB4 Estimated Purchase Price, as applicable,
for all purposes and shall not be subject to any further challenge of any kind
by the applicable Parties.

(aq)Upon the determination of the appropriate adjustments, the applicable
Purchaser and Seller shall effectuate such adjustments by including them in
the payments to occur at the Closing or, if such adjustments result in
payments being due from one Party to the other after the Closing, by the Party
from whom such payment is due delivering the payment to the other Party no
later than two (2) Business Days after such determination, in immediately
available funds or in any other manner as reasonably requested by the payee,
together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment at
a variable rate of interest equal to the "prime rate" as published in The Wall
Street Journal from time to time during the applicable period.

(ar)Subject to the foregoing, the Independent Accounting Firm may determine
the issues in dispute following such procedures, consistent with the
provisions of this Agreement, as it deems appropriate and with reference to
the amounts in issue. The applicable Purchaser and Seller do not intend to
impose any particular procedures upon the Independent Accounting Firm, it
being the desire of the Parties that any such disagreement shall be resolved
as expeditiously and inexpensively as reasonably practicable. Each Party shall
provide the Independent Accounting Firm with such access to documents and
personnel as the Independent Accounting Firm may reasonably request and
otherwise shall cooperate with the Independent Accounting Firm in the conduct
of its work under this Section 3.8; provided, however, that a Party shall have
no obligation to provide the Independent Accounting Firm access to any
information protected by legal privilege. The Parties agree that the
Independent Accounting Firm shall have no liability to the Parties in
connection with services, except for acts of bad faith, willful misconduct or
gross negligence, and the Parties shall provide such indemnities to the
Independent Accounting Firm as it may reasonably request consistent with the
foregoing.

to a given dispute between Seller and a Purchaser shall be paid one-half by
Seller and one-half by such Purchaser.

properly 

included therein for tax purposes) among the Purchased Assets that is
consistent with the allocation methodology provided by Section 1060 of the

or audit.

Purchased Assets to be purchased by EGSL as of such filing; and (iii) ETI
shall use good faith efforts to file with the PUCT on or before March 1, 2015,
its initial application seeking approval to purchase the portion of the
Purchased Assets to be purchased by ETI as of such filing.

(s)Seller and each Project Purchaser shall use good faith efforts to file on
or before March 1, 2015, a request for (i) a temporary waiver, for a period of
time beginning upon the issuance of any order granting such waiver and ending
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, of the FERC\'s capacity release rules
as set forth in 18 C.F.R. § 284.8 ("Capacity Release Rules") and other related
FERC policies and requirements with respect to the Gas Transportation
Agreement (FERC), including the shipper-must-have-title policy, the
prohibition on buy-sell arrangements, the prohibition on tying, posting and
bidding requirements, and the restrictions on capacity releases above or below
the applicable maximum rate, and (ii) any waivers of the FERC Gas Tariff
governing service provided pursuant to the Gas Transportation Agreement (FERC)
necessary to relieve Seller of any and all liability under such Gas
Transportation Agreement (FERC) (solely to the extent such liability is
allocable to the period after the Closing Date and not resulting from any
breach or default by, or waiver or extension given by or to, Seller).

(t)The Parties acknowledge and agree that a Party shall be deemed to have
acted in good faith if any of the initial application filings described in
Section 6.4(a), Section 6.4(b), Section 6.4(c), Section 6.4(d), and Section
6.4(e) is delayed beyond the date provided therein as a result of any need to
address in such application or resolve any material legal or regulatory risk
or issue prior to submission of such application, including any issue arising
from communications with the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission,
FERC or APSC, LPSC or PUCT staff, as applicable, any issue concerning
application sequencing or docket congestion, and any newly issued or
promulgated Law or official guidance.

(u)Each Purchaser shall, with respect to its Purchasers\' Regulatory
Approvals, and Seller shall, with respect to Seller\'s Regulatory Approvals:

(i)use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to prevent the entry in a judicial or
administrative proceeding brought by any Governmental Authority or any other
Person for a permanent or preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order
or other similar Order that would make unlawful, prevent or delay consummation
of the Transactions; and

(ii)promptly take, in the event that such an injunction or similar Order has
been issued in such a proceeding, any and all Commercially Reasonable Efforts,
including the appeal thereof and the posting of a bond to vacate, modify or
suspend such injunction or Order so as to permit the consummation of the
Transactions on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this
Agreement.

(v)With respect to the Seller\'s Regulatory Approvals and Purchasers\'
Regulatory Approvals referenced in Section 6.4(a) and Section 6.4(b), each
Purchaser shall, upon the request of Seller, and Seller and Entegra TC shall,
upon the request of any Purchaser, mutually execute and deliver a joint
defense agreement regarding such applications in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit H. 

(w)While EAI's request for regulatory approval to purchase the portion of the
Purchased Assets to be purchased by EAI pursuant to this Agreement is pending
before the APSC, EAI agrees not to seek to obtain APSC approval of any
generating unit power purchase or acquisition agreement that (i) is based on a
proposal submitted to EAI in response to any request for proposals being
conducted by EAI as of the Effective Date and (ii) would eliminate the need,
under EAI's resource planning principles, for EAI to purchase the portion of
the Purchased Assets to be purchased by EAI pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 6.5. Permit, Emission Allowance and Purchased Contract Transfers

.

(x)Each Purchaser shall have primary responsibility for securing, at its
expense, the transfer or re-issuance at or after the Closing of the Purchased
Permits and the Emission Allowances to be transferred or re-issued to such
Purchaser that are held by or for Seller or any Affiliate thereof, as and when
required by Law. Subject to Section 6.2(d), Seller shall use, prior to, on
and, if applicable, after the Closing, at its expense, Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to cooperate and assist each Purchaser with, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to cooperate and assist each Purchaser with, the transfer
and re-issuance of the Purchased Permits and Emission Allowances to be
transferred or re-issued to such Purchaser, including by timely executing and
delivering any and all reasonably required forms or providing timely and
appropriate notices and information to Governmental Authorities for such
Purchaser to timely obtain all Purchased Permits and Emission Allowances to be
transferred or re-issued to such Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.1(g), Section
2.1(l), Section 2.5(g), Section 2.5(l), Section 2.9(g), Section 2.9(l),
Section 2.13(g), Section 2.13(l) or Section 2.17(g), as applicable, and by
enforcing legal rights available to Seller under the terms of the Purchased
Permits, Emission Allowances and related Contracts.

(y)Other than as provided in Section 6.5(a) with respect to Purchased Permits
and Emission Allowances, Seller shall have primary responsibility for securing
Seller\'s Consents. Subject to Section 6.2(c), each Purchaser shall use, prior
to, on and, if applicable, after the Closing, and at its expense, Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to cooperate and assist Seller with, and shall cause its
Representatives to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate and assist
Seller with, securing Seller\'s Consents, including by timely executing and
delivering any and all reasonably required documentation and providing any
reasonably required information to any Person from whom a Seller\'s Consent is
sought as so reasonably requested by Seller or such Person; provided, however,
that no Purchaser shall have any obligation to pay any Consent fee, charge,
payment or other similar cost, however expressed, in connection therewith.

(z)Seller shall not be obligated or permitted, without the applicable
Purchaser\'s prior consent, to transfer a Purchased Permit, Emission
Allowance, Purchased Contract, Purchased License or Purchased Warranty to such
Purchaser (or its designee) to whom such Purchased Permit, Emission Allowance,
Purchased Contract, Purchased License or Purchased Warranty is to be
transferred without the applicable Seller\'s Consent having been obtained if
the transfer by Seller or assumption by such Purchaser of the same would
constitute a breach or default under the Purchased Permit, Emission Allowance,
Purchased Contract, Purchased License or Purchased Warranty or violate any Law
(each a "Non-Assigned Asset"). If any such Seller\'s Consent is not obtained
prior to the Closing, to the extent and for so long as the applicable Non-
Assigned Asset shall not have been transferred to the applicable Purchaser to
whom such Non-Assignable Asset is to be transferred, or its designee, Seller
shall, following the Closing, to the extent permitted by Law, hold such Non-
Assigned Asset in trust for the use and benefit of such Purchaser (or its
designee) and shall take such other actions (including entering into written
agreements, notice of which shall, with respect to each Purchased Permit or
Emission Allowance that is a Non-Assigned Asset, be provided, to the extent
required by Law, by such Purchaser to the Governmental Authority transferring
or re-issuing such Non-Assigned Asset) as such Purchaser may reasonably
request in order to place such Purchaser or its designee in a substantively
similar position to that which would have been in effect if such Seller\'s
Consent had been 

obtained, or to provide such Purchaser or its designee the full rights,
privileges and benefits of, any such Non-Assigned Asset not transferred to
such Purchaser or its designee. To the extent permitted by Law, such Purchaser
shall agree to perform for the benefit of Seller and comply with the
obligations of Seller, at such Purchaser\'s expense, with respect to the
Non‑Assigned Assets, to the extent such obligations are reasonably capable of
being performed and complied with by such Purchaser, from and after the
Closing through the completion of the transfer or re-issuance of such Non-
Assigned Asset to such Purchaser or its designee or the expiration thereof
according to its terms. Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall limit a Party\'s
obligations or liabilities under Article III and Section 6.1 or Section 6.2.

(aa)With respect to any applicable compliance period that begins on or before
the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, (i) Seller shall be
responsible for procuring and transferring to each Project Purchaser\'s or its
designated agent\'s account, on or before the end of such compliance period,
sufficient Emission Allowances for such compliance period as required under
Environmental Laws and not previously surrendered by Seller to the applicable
Governmental Authority in respect of such compliance period with respect to
the Project or the Business for the portion of such period up to and including
the Closing (such responsibility, an Excluded Liability), and (ii) each
Purchaser shall be responsible for procuring and transferring to its own or
its designated agent\'s account, on or before the end of each such compliance
period sufficient Emission Allowances for such compliance period as required
under Environmental Laws with respect to the ownership and operation of the
Purchased Assets it acquires for the portion of such period after the Closing
(such responsibility, an Assumed Liability). The Parties agree that, with
respect to each such compliance period, each Purchaser shall, or shall cause
its designated agent to, prepare and timely file all notices and other
filings, and take any other commercially reasonable actions, as necessary to
comply in all material respects with Environmental Laws regarding Emission
Allowances for such compliance period with respect to the applicable emissions
allocable to the ownership and operation of the Purchased Assets it acquired
for each such entire compliance period. The Parties further agree that,
notwithstanding the transfer to Project Purchasers or their designated
agent(s) pursuant to Section 2.1(l), Section 2.5(l), Section 2.9(l) and
Section 2.13(l) of the Project Emission Allowances, the following Emission
Allowances included in such Emission Allowances shall be held by Project
Purchasers or their designated agent(s) for the benefit of Seller and used or
otherwise applied by Project Purchasers or their designated agent(s) to
satisfy all or part, as applicable, of Seller\'s responsibilities pursuant to
subsection (i) above for each such applicable compliance period: (A) unused
and valid Emission Allowances granted with respect to all compliance periods
ending on or before the Closing Date; and (B) the portion of the Emission
Allowances granted with respect to any of the applicable compliance periods
beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date
allocated to Seller based on the total Emission Allowances granted with
respect to any such period, multiplied by the percentage representing the
number of days during such period that occurred on or prior to the Closing
Date divided by the total number of days in such period. After the completion
of such actions with respect to all such compliance periods, any excess
Emission Allowances with respect to (i) PB1 shall be the sole property of PB1
Purchaser, (ii) PB2 shall be the sole property of PB2 Purchaser, (iii) PB3
shall be the sole property of PB3 Purchaser, (iv) PB4 shall be the sole
property of PB4 Purchaser and (v) the Common Facilities Assets shall be the
sole property of the Project Purchasers in proportion to each such Project
Purchaser\'s Undivided Pro Rata Percentage.

(ab)With respect to each compliance period that begins on or before the
Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and timely
file, in accordance with Good Industry Practices, Laws, and the other
applicable terms of this Agreement, the Arkansas Air Operating Permit Semi-
Annual Monitoring Report (in accordance with General Provision 7 and 40 C.F.R.
70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A)) and the Title V "Annual Compliance Certification" (in
accordance with General Provision 21 and 40 C.F.R. 70.6(c)(5)) with US EPA
Region 6 and the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, in each case,
with respect to the portion of the compliance period up to and including the
Closing. Prior to filing each such report or certification, Seller shall (i)
provide each Project Purchaser with a copy of Seller\'s proposed report or
certification and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and
(ii) consider in good faith all 

comments and suggestions made by any such Project Purchaser with respect
thereto and submitted to Seller in a timely fashion prior to the applicable
deadline for such filing.

(ac)In connection with Seller\'s renewal of its NPDES Permit (No. AR0049140)
and any other material Permit for the Project, Seller shall (i) give each
Project Purchaser reasonable advance notice of the deadline for submitting
such renewal application, (ii) prior to filing any such renewal application,
provide each Project Purchaser with a copy of Seller\'s proposed application
and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such application and
(iii) consider, in good faith, all comments and suggestions made by any such
Project Purchaser pertaining to such application and submitted to Seller in a
timely fashion prior to the applicable deadline for such filing.

Section 6.6. Current Evidence of Title

.

(ad) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Date, each
Project Purchaser shall obtain the following items with respect to the PB1
Insurable Real Property, the PB2 Insurable Real Property, the PB3 Insurable
Real Property and the PB4 Insurable Real Property, as applicable:

(i)Title commitments issued by the Title Insurer to insure title to (A) all
PB1 Insurable Real Property in the amount specified by PB1 Purchaser, but not
exceeding the PB1 Purchase Price, naming PB1 Purchaser as the proposed insured
and having an effective date after the Effective Date (but no later than the
Closing Date), wherein the Title Insurer shall agree to issue an ALTA 2006
form Owner\'s Policy of Title Insurance (the "PB1 Title Commitment"); (B) all
PB2 Insurable Real Property in the amount specified by PB2 Purchaser, but not
exceeding the PB2 Purchase Price, naming PB2 Purchaser as the proposed insured
and having an effective date after the Effective Date (but no later than the
Closing Date), wherein the Title Insurer shall agree to issue an ALTA 2006
form Owner\'s Policy of Title Insurance (the "PB2 Title Commitment"); (C) all
PB3 Insurable Real Property in the amount specified by PB3 Purchaser, but not
exceeding the PB3 Purchase Price, naming PB3 Purchaser as the proposed insured
and having an effective date after the Effective Date (but no later than the
Closing Date), wherein the Title Insurer shall agree to issue an ALTA 2006
form Owner\'s Policy of Title Insurance (the "PB3 Title Commitment"); (D) all
PB4 Insurable Real Property in the amount specified by PB4 Purchaser, but not
exceeding the PB4 Purchase Price, naming PB4 Purchaser as the proposed insured
and having an effective date after the Effective Date (but no later than the
Closing Date), wherein the Title Insurer shall agree to issue an ALTA 2006
form Owner\'s Policy of Title Insurance (the "PB4 Title Commitment" and,
together with the PB1 Title Commitment, the PB2 Title Commitment and the PB3
Title Commitment, collectively, the "Title Commitments");

(ii)Complete and legible copies of all documents listed on Schedule B -
Section 1 and Schedule B - Section 2 to each Title Commitment (the "Recorded
Documents"); and

(iii)An as-built survey of the Insurable Real Property made after the
Effective Date by a land surveyor licensed by the state where the Insurable
Real Property is located and bearing a certificate, signed and sealed by the
surveyor, certifying to each Project Purchaser and the Title Insurer that such
survey was made in accordance with "2011 Minimum Standard Detail Requirements
for ALTA/ACSM Land/Title Surveys, jointly established and adopted by ALTA and
NSPS, and includes Items 1-4, 6, 7(a), 7(b)(1), 7(c), 8-11 and 13 of Table A
thereof" (the "Survey"). The Survey shall separately show each of the PB1
Owned Real Property, the PB1 IDA Bond Real Property, the PB1 Leased Real
Property, the PB1 Easements, the PB2 Owned Real Property, the PB2 IDA Bond
Real Property, the PB2 Leased Real Property, the PB2 Easements, the PB3 Owned
Real Property, the PB3 IDA Bond Real Property, the PB3 Leased Real Property,
the PB3 Easements, the PB4 Owned Real Property, the PB4 IDA Bond Real
Property, the PB4 Leased Real Property, the PB4 Easements, the Common
Facilities Owned Real Property, the Common Facilities IDA Bond Real Property,
the Common Facilities Leased Real Property, and the Common Facilities
Easements. The Parties 

acknowledge that the Project Real Property has not previously been surveyed to
show the foregoing properties separately. During the period between the
Effective Date and the Closing Date, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith
to determine the exact location of each of the foregoing properties.

(ae)Each Title Commitment shall include the Title Insurer\'s requirements for
issuing its title policy.

(af)If any of the following shall occur (collectively, a "Title Objection"):

(i)any title exception is disclosed in Schedule B-2 to any Title Commitment
that is not a Permitted Encumbrance; or

(ii)the Survey discloses any matter that is not a Permitted Encumbrance,

any Purchaser may notify Seller in writing of such matters and the basis for
such objections by one hundred eighty (180) days following the Effective Date
(the "Title Review Period"). Any matter reflected in the Title Commitments,
Survey and copies of Recorded Documents that is not objected to by a Purchaser
prior to the expiration of the Title Review Period shall, as to the portions
of the Insurable Real Property shown to be affected thereby, be considered a
"Permitted Encumbrance"; provided, however, that in no event may any matter or
instrument that affects any Insurable Real Property become a Permitted
Encumbrance prior to the time each Purchaser has been advised in writing
(which includes e-mail) or been provided a copy of such Encumbrance by the
Title Insurer or Seller of its existence.

(ag)In the event a Purchaser notifies Seller of a Title Objection in writing
prior to the Title Review Period, then Seller shall have thirty (30) days from
receipt of such notice during which it may attempt to cure such Title
Objection; provided, that it is expressly understood that in no event shall
Seller be required to take any action, bring any proceeding or otherwise incur
any expense in order to eliminate any Title Objections, other than those
exceptions that (i) are recorded by or with the consent of the Seller or
result from the acts or omissions of Seller and are not otherwise permitted by
this Agreement or approved by Purchasers or (ii) can be removed by the payment
of a liquidated sum of money; provided, that in no event shall Seller be
obligated under clause (ii) to pay in excess of (x) $5,000,000 in the
aggregate as to all such Title Objections with respect to any one of the Owned
Real Property, the IDA Bond Real Property, any Power Block Easement or any
Common Facilities Easements or (y) $10,000,000 in the aggregate with respect
to all Project Real Property; provided, further, that Seller shall not be
obligated to make any such payments with respect to any Project Real Property
in which Seller owns less than a fee interest to the extent such exception is
attributable to the owner of such property and not to Seller. Seller shall
have the right to adjourn the Closing for a reasonable period (not to exceed
sixty (60) days) in order to cure any Title Objection which Seller is required
to or elects to cure hereunder.

(ah)In lieu of satisfying any of the Title Objections set forth in clause (d),
Seller shall have the option, but not the obligation, to deposit with the
Title Insurer such sum of money or deliver to the Title Insurer such
affidavits and certificates as may be required by the Title Insurer to induce
the Title Insurer to omit such lien and/or encumbrance as an exception to
title or to affirmatively insure Purchasers against collection of liens and/or
encumbrances that are not Permitted Encumbrances; provided, that the Title
Insurer shall commit, in writing, prior to the Closing Date to omit such lien
or encumbrance as an exception to title.

(ai)Without limiting the obligations of Seller pursuant to clause (d), if any
Title Objection is not timely cured, in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
Purchasers, then Purchasers may elect either to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of this clause (f) or Purchasers may waive such Title
Objection and accept such title as such Seller is able to convey, without
reduction in the PB1 Purchase Price, the PB2 Purchase Price, the PB3 Purchase
Price or the PB4 Purchase Price, as applicable, and such waiver shall not
affect the Closing, be deemed to cause any of the conditions to Closing set
forth in Article VII to be unsatisfied or entitle any Project Purchaser to
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1, Section 9.2, Section 9.3 or Section
9.4. If Purchasers notify Sellers that title to the Real Property is
acceptable or fails to notify Seller in writing of any Title Objection within
the Title Review Period, then Purchasers shall be conclusively presumed to 

have waived their right to raise any Title Objection and to have approved the
condition of title shown in the Title Commitments and all matters shown on the
Survey and shall accept such title at Closing.

(aj)Upon receipt of a final Survey that shows the PB1 Owned Real Property, the
PB1 IDA Bond Real Property, the PB1 Leased Real Property, the PB1 Easements,
the PB2 Owned Real Property, the PB2 IDA Bond Real Property, the PB2 Leased
Real Property, the PB2 Easements, the PB3 Owned Real Property, the PB3 IDA
Bond Real Property, the PB3 Leased Real Property, the PB3 Easements, the PB4
Owned Real Property, the PB4 IDA Bond Real Property, the PB4 Leased Real
Property, the PB4 Easements, the Common Facilities Owned Real Property, the
Common Facilities IDA Bond Real Property, the Common Facilities Leased Real
Property, and the Common Facilities Easements, Seller and each Project
Purchaser shall amend this Agreement to replace Schedules 2.1(a), 2.1(b),
2.1(c), 2.5(a), 2.5(b), 2.5(c), 2.9(a), 2.9(b), 2.9(c), 2.13(a), 2.13(b),
2.13(c), 2.17(a), 2.17(b) and 2.17(c); provided that the representations set
forth in Section 4.7 shall only refer to the drawings provided as of the
Effective Date and not the surveys provided by the Purchasers' surveyor.

Section 6.7. Power Block Performance Tests

.

(ak)The Parties agree that this Section 6.7 shall govern the performance of
Power Block Performance Tests under this Agreement. All Power Block
Performance Tests shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of
this Agreement. The Testing Party shall bear the costs to conduct each
applicable Power Block Performance Test and shall reimburse the other Parties
for the reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses, if any,
incurred by such other Parties to conduct such Power Block Performance Test
(i) upon or within thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this
Agreement or (ii) if the Closing occurs, at the Closing. Without limiting the
foregoing or the terms of Schedule 6.7, (i) Seller shall be responsible for
providing all test instrumentation, equipment, systems, tools, material, labor
(including testing specialists), utilities, and services necessary to conduct
each Power Block Performance Test, and (ii) the applicable Project Purchaser
shall schedule and dispatch the Power Block\'s electric generation units as
required by the Power Block Performance Test and purchase the electric energy
dispatched to such Project Purchaser therefrom pursuant to the payment terms
set forth in any PPA then in effect with respect to such Power Block or, if no
such agreement is then in effect or if such agreement does not address payment
terms for electric energy from a Power Block Performance Test, on payment
terms mutually agreed to by Seller and such Project Purchaser. If a Power
Block Performance Test cannot be performed in accordance with the requirements
herein at the time of a scheduled Power Block Performance Test due to an
equipment failure or malfunction at the Project, a force majeure, or other
unplanned outage, the Testing Party shall cause the Power Block Performance
Test to be rescheduled as soon as possible after such unplanned outage has
been remedied. Seller may terminate in its discretion, any Power Block
Performance Test during the conduct thereof and such test shall not be deemed
a "Power Block Performance Test" for purposes of Section 6.7 (other than this
Section 6.7(a)); provided, that if Seller does elect to so terminate such a
test, Seller shall cause the Power Block Performance Test to be rescheduled as
soon as possible and shall be deemed the "Testing Party" with respect to such
test for purposes of this Section 6.7(a).

(al)For each Power Block Performance Test, the Testing Party shall deliver the
final written report of the Power Block Performance Test Contractor (each, a
"Power Block Performance Test Report") that documents, explains and certifies
the performance and final results of such Power Block Performance Test (the
"Power Block Performance Test Results") to the applicable Project Purchaser,
if Seller is the Testing Party, or to Seller, if a Project Purchaser is the
Testing Party, promptly after receipt thereof from the Power Block Performance
Test Contractor, but in any event within thirty (30) days of such Power Block
Performance Test. Each Power Block Performance Test Report shall include the
calibration records for the test instrumentation and otherwise meet the
requirements set forth in Schedule 6.7. The Testing Party shall 

provide the applicable Project Purchaser, if Seller is the Testing Party, or
Seller, if a Project Purchaser is the Testing Party, with (i) reasonable
advance notice of and a reasonable opportunity to witness each Power Block
Performance Test, (ii) any draft written report prepared by the Power Block
Performance Test Contractor and delivered to the Testing Party and (iii) a
reasonable opportunity to participate in any material communication between
the Testing Party and the Power Block Performance Test Contractor related to
the Power Block Performance Test.

(am)The Parties agree that each Power Block Performance Test shall be
conducted in connection with the Closing. To facilitate planning for each such
Power Block Performance Test, Purchasers shall notify Seller of their
reasonable best estimate of the Closing Date (as may be modified pursuant to
clauses (g) or (h) below, the "Target Closing Date") on or before one hundred
and forty (140) days prior to the Target Closing Date.

(an)No earlier than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the Target
Closing Date, but no later than ninety (90) days prior to such Target Closing
Date, Seller shall conduct, at its expense, a Power Block Performance Test
with respect to each Power Block (each, an "Initial Power Block Performance
Test"). If the Power Block Performance Test Results of the Initial Power Block
Performance Test for any Power Block indicate that one or more of the Power
Block Performance Parameters for such Power Block was not achieved, then
either Seller or the Project Purchaser of such Power Block may, upon five (5)
days\' prior written notice to the other Parties, elect to conduct, at its
expense, no later than forty-five (45) days prior to such Target Closing Date
and using the same Power Block Performance Test Contractor that performed the
Initial Power Block Performance Test for such Power Block, another Power Block
Performance Test with respect to such Power Block (a "Power Block Performance
Re-Test").

(ao)If the Power Block Performance Test Results of a Power Block Performance
Re-Test for any Power Block indicate that one or more of the Power Block
Performance Parameters for such Power Block was not achieved, then either
Seller or the Project Purchaser of such Power Block, upon five (5) days\'
prior written notice to the other Party, elect to conduct, at its expense, no
later than forty-five (45) days prior to the Target Closing Date, and using
the same Power Block Performance Test Contractor that performed the Initial
Power Block Performance Test for such Power Block and any Power Block
Performance Re-Tests for such Power Block, additional Power Block Performance
Re-Tests for such Power Block.

(ap)If Seller or a Project Purchaser has elected to conduct a Power Block
Performance Re-Test in accordance with this Section 6.7, such Party shall be
the Testing Party for purposes of such Power Block Performance Re-Test and
shall cause the Power Block Performance Re-Test to be conducted. If more than
one Party has made such an election, the Party first delivering notice of such
election to the other Party in accordance with this Agreement shall be deemed
the Testing Party.

(aq)In the event that the Power Block Performance Test Results of the Initial
Power Block Performance Test for any Power Block or a Power Block Performance
Re-Test for such Power Block indicate that one or more of the Power Block
Performance Parameters for such Power Block was not achieved, Seller
determines in good faith that such failure was due to one or more identified,
non-speculative mechanical, electrical or other physical defects of such Power
Block (a "Testing Defect") and Seller desires to Repair such Testing Defect at
its sole cost and expense and conduct a Power Block Performance Re-Test for
such Power Block but despite the use of Commercially Reasonable Efforts Seller
cannot complete such Repair and perform such Power Block Performance Re-Test
at least forty-five (45) days prior to the Target Closing Date, then:

(i)Seller shall be required to provide each Project Purchaser notice ("Late
Testing Notice") of its intention to perform such Power Block Performance
Re‑Test and indicate, in reasonable detail, the Testing Defect that caused its
failure to achieve one or more of the Power Block Performance Parameters for
such Power Block, the remedial actions that it intends to take to Repair such
Testing Defect (such repair, a "Testing Repair") and the expected time for
commencement and completion of such Testing Repair and each Project Purchaser
shall promptly notify Seller, upon receipt of a Late 

Testing Notice, as to whether it has any information that would require it to
provide notice to Seller under Section 6.7(h) (and, if so, it shall provide
such notice and Section 6.7(h) shall govern);

(ii)Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to complete the Testing
Repair as soon as reasonably practicable in accordance with Good Industry
Practices and the terms of this Agreement;

(iii)if:

(A)the satisfaction of the Power Block Performance Test condition under
Section 7.13 is the last condition to Purchasers\' obligations to be satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature are satisfied at the
Closing), Seller shall designate a new Target Closing Date that is at most one
hundred and twenty (120) days (but no fewer than ninety (90) days) after
Seller\'s completion date for the Testing Repair (but in no event shall the
Target Closing Date be extended beyond the Expiration Date); or

(B)the satisfaction of the Power Block Performance Test condition under
Section 7.13 is not the last condition to Purchasers\' obligations be
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are satisfied at
the Closing), Seller shall notify Purchasers in writing of the completion date
of such Testing Repair at least fifteen (15) days prior thereto and Purchasers
shall designate a new Target Closing Date that is one hundred and twenty (120)
days after Seller\'s completion date for the Testing Repair (but in no event
shall the Target Closing Date be extended beyond the Expiration Date);

and, where the Target Closing Date is so extended, the provisions of this
Section 6.7 shall apply as if such new Target Closing Date were the original
Target Closing Date established hereunder;

(iv)Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with each
Project Purchaser, include each Project Purchaser in meetings, communications
and inspections relating to any Testing Repair conducted under this Section
6.7(g) with respect to a Power Block to be purchased by such Project Purchaser
and otherwise keep such Project Purchaser reasonably informed with respect to
any Testing Repair in order to enable such Project Purchaser to make a
reasonable, informed evaluation of the quality, sufficiency, and acceptability
thereof. Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain customary
warranties related to any Testing Repairs that are freely assignable to the
applicable Project Purchaser. Each Project Purchaser shall have the right to
approve the completion of any Testing Repairs with respect to the Power
Block(s) to be purchased by such Project Purchaser which such approval will be
prompt and will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. All
Testing Repairs performed pursuant to this Section 6.7(g) shall be performed
by an Approved Contractor.

(v)For purposes of this Section 6.7, any Testing Defect that constitutes
parts, machinery, equipment, facilities, systems or others items shall not be
considered Repaired if (A) such "Repair" is temporary or transitional in
nature or such parts, machinery, equipment, facilities, systems or other items
are not, in all material respects, safely and properly connected to, or
integrated and operating safely and properly with, the other machinery,
equipment, facilities, systems and/or items to which it is connected or
integrated or with which it operates, or (B) the operating performance and
capabilities of such machinery, equipment, facilities, systems or items or the
applicable Power Block shall have diminished as a result of such Testing
Defect or "Repair" or the cost to operate and maintain such machinery,
equipment, facilities or systems or the applicable Power Block following such
Testing Defect or "Repair" shall be greater as a result of such Testing Defect
or "Repair", in each case, by more than an immaterial amount relative to the
operating performance and capabilities or costs prior to the Testing Defect or
"Repair"; provided, however, that if the operating performance or capability
that has diminished as a result of a Testing Defect is Power Block Capacity or
Power Block Heat Rate, or if such increased operation and maintenance cost is
due to the applicable Power Block having 

a lower Power Block Capacity or higher Power Block Heat Rate than prior to the
Testing Defect, then such parts, machinery, equipment, facilities, systems or
other items shall not be considered Repaired.

(ar)If, after completion of the Initial Power Block Performance Test or a
Power Block Performance Re-Test with respect to any Power Block, any Purchaser
obtains new information that it cannot achieve Closing within one hundred and
twenty (120) days of the date on which such Initial Power Block Performance
Test or latest such Power Block Performance Re-Test was completed due to such
Purchaser\'s inability to obtain its Purchasers\' Regulatory Approvals by such
date, then either Seller or the applicable Project Purchaser may, upon five
(5) days\' prior written notice to the other Party, elect to conduct, at its
expense, no later than forty-five (45) days prior to a new Target Closing Date
prior to the Expiration Date determined by Purchasers based on its reasonable
good faith estimate of the Closing Date (in the event that either such Party
desires a Power Block Performance Re-Test with respect to such Power Block),
and using the same Power Block Performance Test Contractor, a new Initial
Power Block Performance Test with respect to such Power Block as provided in
Section 6.7(d); provided, that a Project Purchaser shall not have the right to
request a Power Block Performance Re-Test hereunder in connection with any
Purchasers\' Regulatory Approvals which are made necessary due to a
replacement of a Purchaser under Section 2.22(b), Section 2.22(c), Section
2.22(d) or Section 2.22(e).

(as)If the Power Block Performance Test Results for the Initial Power Block
Performance Test or a Power Block Performance Re-Test with respect to (i) any
combustion turbine and heat recovery steam generator stack at any Power Block
establish that (A) the Power Block NOx Emission Rate exceeds the Contract NOx
Emission Rate for such combustion turbine and heat recovery steam generator
stack at such Power Block, and/or (B) the Power Block CO Emission Rate exceeds
the Contract CO Emission Rate for such combustion turbine and heat recovery
steam generator stack at such Power Block, (ii) any turbine generator bearing
of any combustion turbine, steam turbine and generator of any Power Block
establish that the Power Block Vibration Level (Full Load) exceeds the
Contract Vibration Level (Full Load) for such turbine generator bearing of
such combustion turbine, steam turbine and generator of such Power Block
and/or (iii) any "rotor criticals" of any Power Block establish that the Power
Block Vibration Level (Start-Up and Coast-Down) for such "rotor criticals"
exceeds the Contract Vibration Level (Start-Up and Coast-Down) and Seller has,
or reasonably believes it has, corrected such failure, then Seller shall
promptly notify the Project Purchaser of such Power Block of such belief and
either Party may, upon five (5) days\' prior written notice to the other
Party, elect to conduct, at its expense, using the same Power Block
Performance Test Contractor, a Power Block Performance Re-Test with respect to
such combustion turbine and heat recovery steam generator stack at such Power
Block, such turbine generator bearing of any combustion turbine, steam turbine
and generator of such Power Block or such "rotor criticals" of such Power
Block, as applicable, as provided herein.

(at)The "Final Power Block Performance Test Results" shall for any Power
Block, be the Power Block Performance Test Results for either (i) the Initial
Power Block Performance Test for such Power Block, if no Power Block
Performance Re-Test for such Power Block has been conducted, or (ii) the most
recent Power Block Performance Re-Test for such Power Block, if one or more
Power Block Performance Re-Tests for such Power Block have been conducted.

(au)The applicable unadjusted purchase price set forth in Section 3.4(a),
Section 3.4(b), Section 3.4(c), or Section 3.4(d) shall be reduced to reflect
the Final Plant Performance Test Results for each Power Block by the amount
determined pursuant to this Section 6.7(k) (such amount, the "Final Power
Block Performance Reduction Amount"). The Final Plant Performance Reduction
Amount for each Power Block shall be (i) the amount that is the aggregate
effect of sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 6.7(k) for such Power
Block, to the extent such amount would require a reduction in the applicable
unadjusted purchase price, or (ii) zero, in the event such amount would
require an increase in the applicable unadjusted purchase price. 

(i)If the Final Power Block Performance Test Results with respect to any Power
Block establish that the Power Block Capacity for such Power Block is below
the Contract Capacity for such Power Block, then (i) the unadjusted purchase
price for such Power Block set forth in Section 3.4(a)(i), Section 3.4(b)(i),
Section 3.4(c)(i), or Section 3.4(d)(i), as applicable, shall be reduced by
$478.79 for each kW by which (A) the Power Block Capacity for such Power Block
is below (B) the Contract Capacity for such Power Block less the Capacity Test
Tolerance for such Power Block, (ii) the unadjusted purchase price for such
Power Block set forth in Section 3.4(a)(ii), Section 3.4(b)(ii), Section
3.4(c)(ii) or Section 3.4(d)(ii), as applicable, shall be reduced by $494.19
for each kW by which (A) the Power Block Capacity for such Power Block is
below (B) the Contract Capacity for such Power Block less the Capacity Test
Tolerance for such Power Block, and (iii) the unadjusted purchase price for
such Power Block set forth in Section 3.4(a)(iii), Section 3.4(b)(iii),
Section 3.4(c)(iii) or Section 3.4(d)(iii), as applicable, shall be reduced by
$509.60 for each kW by which (A) the Power Block Capacity for such Power Block
is below (B) the Contract Capacity for such Power Block less the Capacity Test
Tolerance for such Power Block; provided, however, that if any Purchaser is
purchasing more than one Power Block, the average Power Block Capacity of all
such Power Blocks to be purchased by such Purchaser shall be used to determine
any reduction to the unadjusted purchase price for each such Power Block
pursuant to this Section 6.7(k)(i); provided, further, that in no event shall
(1) the unadjusted purchase price for any Power Block set forth in Section
3.4(a)(i), Section 3.4(b)(i), Section 3.4(c)(i), or Section 3.4(d)(i), as
applicable, be reduced by more than $15,000,000, (2) the unadjusted purchase
price for any Power Block set forth in Section 3.4(a)(ii), Section 3.4(b)(ii),
Section 3.4(c)(ii) or Section 3.4(d)(ii), as applicable, be reduced by more
than $15,500,000, and (3) the unadjusted purchase price for any Power Block
set forth in Section 3.4(a)(iii), Section 3.4(b)(iii), Section 3.4(c)(iii) or
Section 3.4(d)(iii), as applicable, be reduced by more than $16,000,000, in
each case, as a result of this Section 6.7(k)(i). If a purchase price
reduction for any Power Block pursuant to this Section 6.7(k)(i) would exceed
the applicable amount set forth in clause (1), (2) or (3) of this Section
6.7(k)(i), the Project Purchaser of such Power Block shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement on account thereof, without liability or obligation
to Seller or any other Purchaser, upon written notice to Seller and each other
Purchaser provided within sixty (60) days of such Project Purchaser\'s receipt
of the Final Power Block Performance Test Results for such Power Block. Each
Project Purchaser shall be entitled to make full use of the time provided in
the previous sentence (even if the full use of such time would delay the
Closing or require the extension of the Expiration Date, which extension shall
occur without further action of the Parties) to determine whether to exercise
its termination right hereunder, and, for purposes of determining the
applicable PB1 Purchase Price, the PB2 Purchase Price, the PB3 Purchase Price
and the PB4 Purchase Price payable at the Closing, a Seller Condition Failure
shall be deemed to have occurred and be continuing until the expiration of
such sixty (60) day period.

(ii)If the Final Power Block Performance Test Results with respect to any
Power Block establish that the Power Block Heat Rate for such Power Block
exceeds the Contract Heat Rate for such Power Block, then each unadjusted
purchase price set forth in Section 3.4(a), Section 3.4(b), Section 3.4(c) or
Section 3.4(d), as applicable, shall be reduced by $60,000 for each Btu/kWh by
which the Power Block Heat Rate for such Power Block exceeds the sum of (i)
the Contract Heat Rate for such Power Block and (ii) 100 Btu/kWh; provided,
however, that if any Purchaser is purchasing more than one Power Block, the
average Power Block Heat Rate of all such Power Blocks to be purchased by such
Purchaser shall be used to determine any reduction to the unadjusted purchase
price for each such Power Block pursuant to this Section 6.7(k)(ii); provided,
further, that in no event shall the unadjusted purchase price for any Power
Block set forth in Section 3.4(a), Section 3.4(b), Section 3.4(c) or Section
3.4(d), as applicable, be reduced by more than $15,000,000 as a result of this
Section 6.7(k)(ii). If a purchase price reduction for any Power Block pursuant
to this Section 6.7(k)(ii) exceeds $15,000,000, the Project Purchaser of such
Power Block shall have the right to 

terminate this Agreement on account thereof, without liability or obligation
to Sellers or any other Purchaser, upon written notice to Seller and each
other Purchaser provided within sixty (60) days of such Project Purchaser\'s
receipt of the Final Power Block Performance Test Results for such Power
Block. Each Project Purchaser shall be entitled to make full use of the time
provided in the previous sentence (even if the full use of such time would
delay the Closing or require the extension of the Expiration Date, which
extension shall occur without further action of the Parties) to determine
whether to exercise its termination right hereunder, and, for purposes of
determining the PB1 Purchase Price, the PB2 Purchase Price, the PB3 Purchase
Price and the PB4 Purchase Price payable at the Closing, a Seller Condition
Failure shall be deemed to have occurred and be continuing until the
expiration of such sixty (60) day period.

(av)If the Final Power Block Performance Test Results with respect to (i) any
combustion turbine and heat recovery steam generator stack at any Power Block
establish that (A) the Power Block NOx Emission Rate for such combustion
turbine and heat recovery steam generator stack at such Power Block exceeds
the Contract NOx Emission Rate for such combustion turbine and heat recovery
steam generator stack at such Power Block, (B) the Power Block CO Emission
Rate for such combustion turbine and heat recovery steam generator stack at
such Power Block exceeds the Contract CO Emission Rate for such combustion
turbine and heat recovery steam generator stack at such Power Block, (ii) any
turbine generator bearing of any combustion turbine, steam turbine and
generator of any Power Block establish that the Power Block Vibration Level
(Full Load) exceeds the Contract Vibration Level (Full Load) for such turbine
generator bearing of such combustion turbine, steam turbine and generator of
such Power Block and/or (iii) any "rotor criticals" of any Power Block
establish that the Power Block Vibration Level (Start-Up and Coast-Down) for
such "rotor criticals" exceeds the Contract Vibration Level (Start-Up and
Coast-Down), Seller shall, at its expense, use Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to correct any such failure to achieve (1) the Contract NOx Emission Rate for
such combustion turbine and heat recovery steam generator stack at such Power
Block, (2) the Contract CO Emission Rate for such combustion turbine and heat
recovery steam generator stack at such Power Block, (3) the Contract Vibration
Level (Full Load) for turbine generator bearing of such combustion turbine,
steam turbine and generator of such Power Block and/or (4) the Contract
Vibration Level (Start-Up and Coast-Down) for all "rotor criticals" of such
Power Block, as applicable, as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event
later than a date sufficient to allow the Closing to occur by the Expiration
Date. For purposes of determining the PB1 Purchase Price, the PB2 Purchase
Price, the PB3 Purchase Price and the PB4 Purchase Price, a Seller Condition
Failure shall be deemed to have occurred and be continuing until Seller has
corrected any such failure.

(aw)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall not be
entitled to any increase in the PB1 Purchase Price, the PB2 Purchase Price,
the PB3 Purchase Price or the PB4 Purchase Price, as applicable, or any other
additional compensation from any Purchaser if the Final Power Block
Performance Test Results with respect to a Power Block reflect (i) a Power
Block Capacity for such Power Block above the Contract Capacity for such Power
Block, (ii) a Power Block Heat Rate for such Power Block below the Contract
Heat Rate for such Power Block, (iii) a Power Block NOx Emission Rate for such
Power Block below the Contract NOx Emission Rate for such Power Block, (iv) a
Power Block CO Emission Rate below the Contract CO Emission Rate for such
Power Block, (v) a Power Block Vibration Level (Full Load) below the Contract

conditions) that makes impossible or unlikely, or would reasonably be expected

satisfaction of the conditions in Article VII or in Section 8.1 or Section
8.5. Subject to Section 11.2, no notification made pursuant to this Section
6.13(b) shall be deemed to cure any inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of any Purchaser or to prevent, limit or restrict Seller\'s exercise
of its rights under this Agreement prior to the Closing.

(bq)From and after the Effective Date, Seller shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, its respective Monthly Operating Report and Monthly Inventory

delivered, each such Monthly Operating Report and Monthly Inventory Report for
each such calendar month to Purchasers as soon as practicable but in any event
within thirty (30) days of the end of each such calendar month. Unless the
Parties otherwise agree, Seller\'s final Monthly Operating Report and final
Monthly Inventory Report(s) shall be delivered to Purchasers within thirty
(30) days of the month following the month in which the Closing occurs. In
addition, Seller shall provide to Purchasers promptly after the receipt or
production thereof by or to Seller or any Affiliate of Seller any (i) other
material recurring periodic report or other material report by or on behalf of
any third party contractor performing work for Seller or any of its Affiliates
relating to the Project or the conduct of the Business, including any material
budget, budget reconciliation, tracking or monitoring report, request for
unbudgeted capital expenditures or material unbudgeted operating expenditures,
material test report, or material report relating to any material maintenance
on, any material repair, replacement, outage or inspection of, the Project (in

written or electronic materials; provided, that in no event shall Seller have
any obligation hereunder to disclose to any Purchaser any information relating
to the price at which, or the Persons from whom or to whom, it purchases or

Purchaser or its Representative, as applicable, visiting Seller\'s premises.

(bx)Without limitation of the other applicable terms of this Agreement, after
the Closing, each Party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to provide,
or cause to be provided, to the other Parties (and in addition, in the case of
Purchasers, ESI) and its or their respective Representatives, upon reasonable
notice and at the requesting Party\'s cost and expense (which shall be limited
to the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the non-requesting Party),

however, that (i) the Party subject to such contractual prohibition shall use,
upon request by the requesting Party, Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause
such contractual prohibitions to be removed or waived and (ii) nothing in this
Section 6.14(d) shall preclude a Party from contesting by appropriate legal
proceedings any claim of privilege asserted by another Party where the subject
information, work product or communication would, but for the application of
privilege, be required to be disclosed under this Agreement.

Section 6.15. Confidentiality; Public Announcements

.

(bz) All information provided or obtained by a Party, directly or indirectly,
from or on behalf of another Party under this Agreement prior to the Closing

without the prior written consent of Seller, in the case of any Purchaser, and
Purchasers, in the case of Entegra TC or Seller. If any such announcement or
other disclosure is required by any Law or applicable rule or regulation of

to privilege, including the attorney-client and/or work product privileges;
provided, that nothing in this Section 6.15(d) shall preclude a Party from

Closing any and all of its tangible Excluded Assets (other than the Major
Maintenance Spares that Purchasers do not elect to purchase pursuant to
Section 2.21) located at, on, in or under the Project Real Property or any
Off-Site Real Property. From time to time, for a period of up to three hundred
and sixty-five (365) days following the Closing, Seller may remove, at its
sole cost and expense, and without unreasonable interference with the normal
business operations or activities of any Project Purchaser at the Project Real
Property, any of its tangible Excluded Assets remaining at, on, in or under
the Project Real Property as of the Closing. The dates and times of any such
removal shall be coordinated reasonably in advance with the appropriate
Purchaser. No Purchaser shall have any liability to Seller whatsoever with
respect to Seller\'s tangible Excluded Assets remaining at, on, in or under
the Project Real Property on or after the Closing (except to the extent that a
Purchaser utilizes or disposes of any such Excluded Assets without Seller's
prior written consent). If Seller fails to remove all of Seller\'s tangible
Excluded Assets located at, on, in or under the Project Real Property within
such three hundred and sixty-five (365)-day period, then each such remaining
tangible Excluded Asset shall be deemed to have been abandoned by Seller, and
the applicable Purchaser may appropriate, sell, store, destroy or otherwise
dispose of all or any portion of such tangible Excluded Assets without notice
to Seller and without any obligation to account for such tangible Excluded
Assets. To the extent the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
by any Purchaser in connection with appropriating, selling, storing,
destroying or otherwise disposing of such tangible Excluded Assets exceed the
revenues received by such Purchaser in connection therewith, Seller shall
reimburse such Purchaser for all such reasonable out-of-pocket excess costs
and expenses within ten (10) days of such Purchaser\'s delivery to Seller of a
written request therefor. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the terms and conditions of this Section 6.16 shall survive the
Closing.

Section 6.17. Trade Names

. With respect to any name of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller or any related
or similar trade name, trademark, service mark, corporate name, logo or any
similar Intellectual Property that may appear on any of the physical assets
constituting the Purchased Assets, the Purchaser of such Purchased Assets is
hereby granted, fully-paid-up, royalty-free, a limited right and license
solely to allow such Purchaser to display or retain such Intellectual Property
on such Purchased Assets, in the places and in the forms in which they appear
on such Purchased Assets at Closing, for one year following the Closing. Each
Purchaser shall take Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remove all such
Intellectual Property from the Purchased Assets acquired by such Purchaser
within one year after the Closing.

Section 6.18. Post-Closing Assurances

request of the other Party, any and all further instruments or documents, and
exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to take such further actions as may
reasonably be required, to fulfill and implement the terms of this Agreement
or realize the benefits intended to be afforded hereby, including such actions
as are necessary in connection with obtaining any third party Consent, Permit,
or waiver or any regulatory filing as a Party may undertake in connection
herewith.

Section 6.19. MISO Specific Covenants

(cd)Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense, timely execute and file all
documents (including any applicable request for qualification as a capacity
resource in MISO) and take all other commercially reasonable actions
(including identifying and complying with certification and testing
procedures) necessary or advisable to obtain all capacity credits arising out
of capacity from PB1, PB2, PB3 and PB4 (except, as applicable, to the extent
provided otherwise in Section 6.19(b)) for (i) the MISO planning period
(which, as of the Effective Date, is a planning year beginning on June 1 and
ending on the following May 31) in which the Closing Date occurs and (ii) if
the Closing Date occurs after completion of MISO\'s planning resource auction
(or successor process) for the MISO planning period immediately following the
MISO planning period in effect on the Closing Date (for example (applying the
current MISO Rules), if the Closing Date is May 1), such immediately following
MISO planning period. Without limiting the foregoing, such actions shall
include (A) taking all steps required by MISO in accordance with the MISO
Rules to facilitate MISO\'s determination of the UCAP of each Power Block and
the Project pursuant to the MISO Rules, (B) taking all commercially reasonable
steps to maximize the amount of UCAP assigned by MISO to each Power Block and
the Project (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this clause
(B) shall require Seller to take any steps regarding (1) the operation or
maintenance of the Project above and beyond those otherwise required by this
Agreement or (2) obtaining additional NRIS) and (C) converting all of the UCAP
of each Power Block and the Project into MISO zonal resource credits (or other
applicable capacity credits).

(ce)If (i) EAI is not the Project Purchaser of PB1 or, if pursuant to Section
2.23 PB1 is no longer the Contract Power Block (as defined in the EAI Tolling
Agreement), the Tolled Power Block and (ii) the EAI Tolling Agreement is in
effect at the time such documents and actions are required to be filed or
made, EAI shall, at its sole cost and expense, timely execute and file all
documents (including any applicable request for qualification as a capacity
resource in MISO) and take all other commercially reasonable actions
(including identifying and complying with certification and testing
procedures) necessary or advisable to obtain all capacity credits arising out
of capacity from PB1 or, if applicable, the Tolled Power Block for (A) the
MISO planning period in which the Closing Date occurs and (B) if the Closing
Date occurs after completion of MISO\'s planning resource auction (or
successor process) for the MISO planning period immediately following the MISO
planning period in effect on the Closing Date (for example, under the current
MISO Rules, if the Closing Date is May 1), such immediately following MISO
planning period. Without limiting the foregoing, such actions shall include,
subject to the terms of the EAI Tolling Agreement, (1) taking all steps
required by MISO of EAI (as Market Participant for PB1 or, if applicable, the
Tolled Power Block) or that otherwise are reasonable and appropriate to
facilitate MISO\'s determination of the UCAP of PB1 or, if applicable, the
Tolled Power Block pursuant to the MISO Rules, (2) taking all commercially
reasonable steps to maximize the amount of UCAP assigned by MISO to PB1 or, if
applicable, the Tolled Power Block) and (3) converting all of the UCAP of PB1
or, if applicable, the Tolled Power Block into MISO zonal resource credits (or
other applicable capacity credits).

(cf)Seller, each Purchaser and, if EAI or ETI ceases to be a Project Purchaser
pursuant to Section 2.22, EAI or ETI, as applicable, shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with the 

other Parties and MISO to facilitate achievement of the purposes and
objectives of Section 6.19(a) and Section 6.19(b).

(cg)Beginning with the first MISO planning period after the Effective Date,
for each MISO planning period, Seller shall promptly notify the applicable
Project Purchaser of each of the following: (i) the UCAP for such planning
period of the Power Block being purchased by such Project Purchaser, (ii) the
MISO zonal resource credits (or other applicable capacity credits) for such
planning period of the Power Block being purchased by such Project Purchaser
that cleared MISO\'s planning resource auction for such planning period and
(iii) any shortfall (including amount) in the UCAP or MISO zonal resource
credits (or other applicable capacity credits) for such planning period
associated with the Power Block being purchased by such Project Purchaser as a
result of Seller\'s non-compliance with Section 6.19(a) or any other term of
this Agreement, in each case except to the extent EAI is obligated pursuant to
Section 6.19(e) to provide such notice to the Project Purchaser of PB1 or, if
applicable, the Tolled Power Block.

(ch)If EAI is required to make the filings and take the actions described in
Section 6.19(b), beginning with the first MISO planning period after the
Effective Date, for each MISO planning period, EAI shall, upon the request of
the Project Purchaser of PB1 or, if pursuant to Section 2.23 PB1 is no longer
the Contract Power Block (as defined in the EAI Tolling Agreement), the Tolled
Power Block, notify such Project Purchaser of each of the following: (i) the
UCAP for such planning period of PB1 or, if applicable, the Tolled Power
Block, (ii) the MISO zonal resource credits (or other applicable capacity
credits) for such planning period of PB1 or, if applicable, the Tolled Power
Block that cleared MISO\'s planning resource auction for such planning period
and (iii) any shortfall (including amount) in the UCAP or MISO zonal resource
credits (or other applicable capacity credits) for such planning period
associated with PB1 or, if applicable, the Tolled Power Block as a result of
EAI\'s non-compliance with Section 6.19(b) or any other term of this
Agreement.

(ci)If any shortfall (including amount) in the UCAP for the applicable
planning period associated with the Power Block being purchased by a Project
Purchaser as a result of Seller\'s non-compliance with Section 6.19(a) or any
other term of this Agreement, the MISO zonal resource credits expressed in
clauses (i)(B) or (ii)(B) above, as applicable, shall be the MISO zonal
resource credits that would have cleared such MISO planning resource auction
had Seller so complied. If MISO does not determine any UCAP for the applicable
planning period associated with such Power Block as a result of Seller\'s non-
compliance with Section 6.19(a) or any other term of this Agreement, the MISO
zonal resource credits expressed in clauses (i)(B) or (ii)(B) above, as
applicable, shall be determined based on (1) the full ICAP determined by MISO
for such planning period for such Power Block (or if MISO does not determine
the ICAP for such planning period for such Power Block, the most recent full
ICAP determined by MISO for such Power Block) minus (2) the product of (x)
such ICAP value multiplied by (y) 0.04. If the EAI Tolling Agreement has not
been terminated as of the Closing, the purchase price for the PB1 Purchased
Assets or, if pursuant to Section 2.23 PB1 is no longer the Contract Power
Block (as defined in the EAI Tolling Agreement), the purchase price for the
portion of the Power Block Purchased Assets that include the Tolled Power
Block shall not be reduced pursuant to this Section 6.19(f).

(cj)For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the other terms of this
Agreement or any Project Purchaser\'s rights with respect to the Power Block
Purchased Assets purchased by such Project Purchaser, on and after the Closing
Date, such Project Purchaser shall have the exclusive right to offer and sell
capacity and related benefits from such Power Block Purchased Assets,
including the right to offer such capacity, in whole or in part, in each MISO
planning resource auction on terms determined by such Project Purchaser in its
sole and absolute discretion, and to receive all revenue and compensation
therefor.

Project Purchaser of PB1 or, if applicable, the Tolled Power Block at the
Closing and (ii) each Project Purchaser shall execute and deliver, upon
reasonable request by Seller, any and all further instruments or documents,
and exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to take such further actions as
may be reasonably required, to fulfill and implement the terms of this Section
6.20 and to cause Seller to, from and after the Closing, be released and fully
discharged (A) as the Market Participant in MISO of the Power Block sold by
Seller to such Project Purchaser and (B) from any and all other obligations,
liabilities and responsibilities accruing to an owner in MISO of the Power
Block purchased by such Project Purchaser.

Section 6.21. IDA Bond Property 

. On or prior to the Closing, (a) Seller shall cause fee simple title to the
PB1 IDA Bond Real Property and title to the PB1 IDA Bond Other Property to be
transferred to PB1 Purchaser and, at the Closing, PB1 Purchaser shall accept
the same from either Union County, Arkansas or Seller, as applicable, (b)
Seller shall cause fee simple title to the PB2 IDA Bond Real Property and
title to the PB2 IDA Bond Other Property to be transferred to PB2 Purchaser
and, at the Closing, PB2 Purchaser shall accept the same from either Union

same from either Union County, Arkansas or Seller, as applicable. To the
extent any transfer of any IDA Bond Real Property or any IDA Bond Other
Property is to be made from Union County, Arkansas rather than Seller, such
transfer shall be (i) pursuant to documentation, terms and procedures to be
agreed with Union County, Arkansas that are reasonably acceptable to Seller,
(ii) without the imposition of any condition or term that is adverse to the
relevant Purchaser or less beneficial to the relevant Purchaser than had the
transfer been made directly by Seller and (iii) on terms acceptable to the
relevant Purchaser in its reasonable discretion. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the unwind of the structure reflected in the IDA Bond Contracts
contemplated by this Section 6.21 shall occur no later than simultaneously

periods required by the IDA Bond Contracts to the extent necessary to unwind
the structure reflected in the IDA Bond Contracts contemplated by this Section
6.21); provided that Seller shall not be required to unwind the structure
reflected in the IDA Bond Contracts contemplated by this Section 6.21 at any
time prior to the Closing. Each Purchaser shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to assist Seller in causing fee simple title to the IDA Bond Real
Property and title to the IDA Bond Other Property to be transferred to the
relevant Purchaser at the Closing as provided herein, including, if
applicable, to execute and deliver such documents and instruments reasonably
required to consummate such transfer from Union County, Arkansas directly to
such Purchaser as contemplated by this Section 6.21. Seller shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause fee simple title to the IDA Bond Real
Property and title to the IDA Bond Other Property to be transferred to the

County, Arkansas to such Purchaser.

Section 6.22. Transmission Upgrades.



(cp)Pending NRIS Request. The Parties acknowledge that (i) Seller has obtained
1,450 MW of NRIS for the Project and (ii) on June 20, 2014, Seller submitted
to MISO a transmission service request seeking 1,270 MW of additional NRIS for
the Project ("Pending NRIS Request"). Subject to the other terms of this
Section 6.22, Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense, prepare and submit
such documents (including documents to MISO requesting and confirming NRIS as
required by this Section 6.22) and take all commercially reasonable actions
(including making timely payment of transmission service study fees, charges,
and similar costs in connection with any request for NRIS for the Project and
each Power Block) necessary or advisable for the Project to be qualified and
recognized by MISO, as promptly as practicable, as having at least 2,000 MW of
NRIS and each Power Block to be qualified and recognized by MISO, as promptly
as practicable, as having at least 500 MW of NRIS (the "Minimum NRIS").

(cq)Certain Covenants of Seller. Without limiting the other terms of this
Agreement, Seller shall (i) provide each Project Purchaser with a complete and
accurate copy of any MISO transmission study 

result (e.g., system impact study, facilities study) for the Pending NRIS
Request or any subsequent request for NRIS for the Project submitted by Seller
prior to the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement ("Other NRIS
Request") promptly after such results are available to Seller and notify each
Project Purchaser of any material development in the processing or treatment
of the Pending NRIS Request or any Other NRIS Request promptly after Seller
receives notice thereof, (ii) notify each Project Purchaser reasonably in
advance of, and allow each Project Purchaser and its respective
Representatives to attend and participate in meetings with, MISO
representatives regarding such study or any proposed agreement committing
Seller to fund the costs to obtain such NRIS ("NRIS Upgrade Agreement"), (iii)
provide each Project Purchaser a reasonable opportunity (within the limited
timeframe afforded for Seller to execute such agreement) to review and comment
on any such NRIS Upgrade Agreement prior to execution thereof and consider in
good faith comments from each such Project Purchaser on any such NRIS Upgrade
Agreement and (iv) cooperate with Project Purchasers with respect to the
effort to obtain from MISO the transmission service for the Project and each
Power Block necessary to satisfy the condition to the Closing set forth in
Section 7.9.

(cr)Confirmation of "No Cost" NRIS. Promptly after issuance of an interim
transmission service study (e.g., a system impact study) arising out of the
Pending NRIS Request or any Other NRIS Request, Seller shall take the actions
required to timely confirm and obtain any NRIS for the Project and each Power
Block that such study shows is available to Seller without Seller having to
incur any NRIS Upgrade Costs and to proceed to the next phase of the
transmission study process in respect of the Pending NRIS Request or such
Other NRIS Request, as applicable.

(cs)Aggregate NRIS Upgrade Costs - $25 Million or Less. If the final
definitive MISO transmission study results for the Pending NRIS Request or
Other NRIS Request provide that in order to obtain the Minimum NRIS for the
Project and each Power Block Seller would incur NRIS Upgrade Costs estimated
to be $25 million or less in the aggregate (inclusive of all NRIS Upgrade
Costs (if any) that Seller has incurred with respect to the Pending NRIS
Request and any Other NRIS Request and all future NRIS Upgrade Costs that
Seller is estimated to incur under the applicable study results and any
existing NRIS Upgrade Agreement(s) or other official then-current estimates of
outstanding NRIS Upgrade Costs (collectively, the "Committed NRIS Upgrade
Costs")), Seller shall, subject to Section 6.22(b), confirm and agree, in
accordance with all applicable MISO and transmission owner requirements, to
obtain (i) the Minimum NRIS and (ii) any amount of NRIS in excess of the
Minimum NRIS that would not require Seller to incur NRIS Upgrade Costs above
the cost to obtain the Minimum NRIS. If Seller enters into one or more NRIS
Upgrade Agreements that collectively will result in Seller obtaining the
Minimum NRIS for the Project and each Power Block and commit Seller to fund
NRIS Upgrade Costs for such Minimum NRIS in an amount estimated to be $25
million or less in the aggregate (inclusive of all Committed NRIS Upgrade
Costs), Seller shall pay the NRIS Upgrade Costs to the appropriate Person(s)
as and when they become due and, upon receipt of an invoice from Seller
reasonably documenting such costs, each Project Purchaser shall promptly
reimburse Seller such Project Purchaser\'s Undivided Pro Rata Percentage of
such NRIS Upgrade Costs; provided, however, that if, and only if, the Closing
occurs, Seller\'s obligation to pay NRIS Upgrade Costs incurred pursuant to
this Section 6.22(d) shall cease to the extent (A) the NRIS Upgrade Agreement
giving rise to such NRIS Upgrade Cost has been assigned or transferred to the
Project Purchasers as provided in this Agreement and (B) the Project
Purchasers are being invoiced therefor; provided, further, however, that if
Seller's obligation to pay the NRIS Upgrade Costs has not ceased pursuant to
the foregoing proviso, each Project Purchaser shall continue to reimburse
Seller such Project Purchaser\'s Undivided Pro Rata Percentage of such NRIS
Upgrade Costs expended by Seller after the Closing as provided in this Section
6.22(d).

(ct)Aggregate NRIS Upgrade Costs - Greater than $25 Million and Less than $50
Million (Seller's Election). If the final definitive MISO transmission study
results for the Pending NRIS Request or Other NRIS Request provide that in
order to obtain the Minimum NRIS for the Project and each Power Block Seller
would incur NRIS Upgrade Costs estimated to be greater than $25 million and
less than $50 million in the aggregate (inclusive of all Committed NRIS
Upgrade Costs), Seller shall promptly (and in any event within five (5) days
after receipt of such final definitive MISO transmission study results) notify
the Project 

Purchasers whether or not it will fund such NRIS Upgrade Costs in full
pursuant to this Section 6.22(e). If Seller does not elect to fund such NRIS
Upgrade Costs in full pursuant to this Section 6.22(e) on or before the last
day of such five (5) day period, Seller shall be deemed to have elected not to
fund such NRIS Upgrade Costs, in which case Section 6.22(f) shall apply. If
Seller notifies the Project Purchasers of its election to fund such NRIS
Upgrade Costs in full, Seller shall (A) subject to Section 6.22(b), confirm
and agree, in accordance with all applicable MISO and transmission owner
requirements, to obtain (1) the Minimum NRIS and (2) any amount of NRIS in
excess of the Minimum NRIS that would not require Seller to incur NRIS Upgrade
Costs above the cost to obtain the Minimum NRIS, (B) enter into one or more
NRIS Upgrade Agreements that collectively will result in Seller obtaining the
Minimum NRIS for the Project and each Power Block and commit Seller to fund
such NRIS Upgrade Costs, and (C) pay the NRIS Upgrade Costs to the appropriate
Person(s) as and when they become due and, upon receipt of an invoice from
Seller reasonably documenting such costs, each Project Purchaser shall
promptly reimburse Seller such Project Purchaser\'s Undivided Pro Rata
Percentage of such NRIS Upgrade Costs until the Project Purchasers have, in
the aggregate, reimbursed Seller $25 million of such NRIS Upgrade Costs;
provided, however, that if, and only if, the Closing occurs, (i) each Project
Purchaser shall at the Closing promptly reimburse Seller such Project
Purchaser\'s Undivided Pro Rata Percentage of all such NRIS Upgrade Costs paid
by Seller and not previously reimbursed to Seller (and such reimbursement
shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the Purchase Price for each applicable
Power Block), and (ii) Seller\'s obligation to pay NRIS Upgrade Costs incurred
pursuant to this Section 6.22(e) shall cease to the extent (I) the NRIS
Upgrade Agreement giving rise to such NRIS Upgrade Cost has been assigned or
transferred to the Project Purchasers as provided in this Agreement and (II)
the Project Purchasers are being invoiced therefor; provided, further,
however, that if Seller's obligation to pay the NRIS Upgrade Costs has not
ceased pursuant to clause (ii) of the foregoing proviso, each Project
Purchaser shall continue to reimburse Seller such Project Purchaser\'s
Undivided Pro Rata Percentage of such NRIS Upgrade Costs expended by Seller
after the Closing as provided in clause (C) of this Section 6.22(e).

(cu)Aggregate NRIS Upgrade Costs - Greater than $25 Million and Less than $50
Million (Project Purchasers' Election). If the final definitive MISO
transmission study results for the Pending NRIS Request or Other NRIS Request

Power Block Seller would incur NRIS Upgrade Costs estimated to be greater than
$25 million and less than $50 million in the aggregate (inclusive of all
Committed NRIS Upgrade Costs), and Seller has notified the Project Purchasers
of its election to not fund such NRIS Upgrade Costs in full pursuant to
Section 6.22(e), or Seller is deemed to have elected not to fund such NRIS
Upgrade Costs in full pursuant to Section 6.22(e), the Project Purchasers may
elect to fund such NRIS Upgrade Costs that are in excess of $25 million and
less than $50 million (inclusive of all Committed NRIS Upgrade Costs) and
proceed with the Transactions, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
to the Closing in Article VII and Article VIII, upon notification to Seller of
such election within five (5) days of Seller's notification of its election,
or the occurrence of Seller's deemed election, not to fund such NRIS Upgrade
Costs in full pursuant to Section 6.22(e). If the Project Purchasers do not
elect to fund such NRIS Upgrade Costs in full pursuant to this Section 6.22(f)
on or before the last day of such five (5) day period, the Project Purchasers
shall be deemed to have elected not to fund such NRIS Upgrade Costs and
Section 6.22(i) shall apply. If the Project Purchasers notify Seller of their
election to fund such NRIS Upgrade Costs that are in excess of $25 million and
less than $50 million (inclusive of all Committed NRIS Upgrade Costs), Seller
shall (A) subject to Section 6.22(b), confirm and agree, in accordance with
all applicable MISO and transmission owner requirements, to obtain (1) the
Minimum NRIS and (2) any amount of NRIS in excess of the Minimum NRIS that
would not require Seller to incur NRIS Upgrade Costs above the cost to obtain
the Minimum NRIS, (B) enter into one or more NRIS Upgrade Agreements that
collectively will result in Seller obtaining the Minimum NRIS for the Project
and each Power Block and commit Seller to fund such NRIS Upgrade Costs, and

provided, however, that if, and 

only if, the Closing occurs, (i) each Project Purchaser shall at the Closing
promptly reimburse Seller such Project Purchaser\'s Undivided Pro Rata
Percentage of all such NRIS Upgrade Costs paid by Seller and not previously
reimbursed to Seller (and such reimbursement shall be deemed to be an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for each applicable Power Block), and (ii)
Seller\'s obligation to pay NRIS Upgrade Costs incurred pursuant to this
Section 6.22(f) shall cease to the extent (A) the NRIS Upgrade Agreement
giving rise to such NRIS Upgrade Cost has been assigned or transferred to the
Project Purchasers as provided in this Agreement and (B) the Project
Purchasers are being invoiced therefor; provided, further, however, that if
Seller's obligation to pay the NRIS Upgrade Costs has not ceased pursuant to
clause (ii) of the foregoing proviso, each Project Purchaser shall continue to
reimburse Seller such Project Purchaser\'s Undivided Pro Rata Percentage of
such NRIS Upgrade Costs expended by Seller after the Closing as provided in
this Section 6.22(f).

(cv)Aggregate NRIS Upgrade Costs - Greater than $50 Million. If the final
definitive MISO transmission study results for the Pending NRIS Request or
Other NRIS Request provide that in order to obtain the Minimum NRIS for the
Project and each Power Block Seller would incur NRIS Upgrade Costs estimated
to be $50 million or more in the aggregate (inclusive of all Committed NRIS
Upgrade Costs), then either Seller or the Project Purchasers may elect to fund
such NRIS Upgrade Costs by written notice to the Project Purchasers, if Seller
makes such election, or to Seller, if the Project Purchasers make such
election, which notice shall be delivered within ten (10) days of the receipt
of such final definitive MISO transmission study, and clause (i) or clause
(ii) of this Section 6.22(g), as applicable, shall apply. If within ten (10)
days of the receipt of the final definitive MISO transmission study results

Closing promptly reimburse Seller such Project Purchaser\'s Undivided Pro Rata
Percentage of all such NRIS Upgrade Costs paid by Seller and not previously
reimbursed to Seller (and such reimbursement shall be deemed to be an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for each applicable Power Block) and (2)
Seller\'s obligation to pay NRIS Upgrade Costs incurred pursuant to this
Section 6.22(h)(i) shall cease to the extent (x) the NRIS Upgrade Agreement
giving rise to such NRIS Upgrade Cost has been assigned or transferred to the
Project Purchasers as provided in this Agreement and (y) the Project
Purchasers are being invoiced therefor; provided, further, however, that if
Seller's obligation to pay the NRIS Upgrade Costs has not ceased pursuant to
clause (2) of the foregoing proviso, each Project Purchaser shall continue to

such NRIS Upgrade Costs expended by Seller after the Closing as provided in
this Section 6.22(h)(i). 

(ii)If the Project Purchasers notify Seller of their election to fund such
NRIS Upgrade Costs in full, Seller shall (A) subject to Section 6.22(b), enter
into one or more NRIS Upgrade Agreements that commit Seller to fund such NRIS

(cx)NRIS Upgrade Restudy. If (i) Section 6.22(f) is applicable and neither
Seller nor the Project Purchasers have elected to fund such NRIS Upgrade Costs
pursuant to Section 6.22(f), (ii) Section 6.22(g) is applicable and neither
Seller nor the Project Purchasers have elected to fund such NRIS Upgrade Costs
pursuant to Section 6.22(g) or (iii) Section 6.22(h) is applicable, then
Seller shall (A) in all of the foregoing cases (unless Seller or the Project
Purchasers have elected to fund such NRIS Upgrade Costs pursuant to Section
6.22(h), in which case Seller shall confirm and agree, in accordance with all
applicable MISO and transmission owner requirements, to obtain such
incremental NRIS in accordance with Section 6.22(h)), neither confirm nor
agree to obtain such incremental NRIS (other than any NRIS that would not
require Seller to incur any NRIS Upgrade Costs) and (B) promptly develop (in
consultation with the Project Purchasers and in accordance with the other
applicable requirements of this Agreement) and submit to MISO, in compliance
with all applicable MISO and transmission owner requirements, an Other NRIS
Request that would result in the Project being qualified and recognized by
MISO as having at least 2,100 MW of NRIS in the aggregate and each Power Block
to be qualified and recognized by MISO as having at least 525 MW of NRIS in
the aggregate. If the final definitive MISO transmission study results for
such Other NRIS Request are not received by April 30, 2016, then Seller or any
of the Project Purchasers may elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 6.22(i) by written notice to the Project Purchasers, if Seller
makes such election, or to Seller, if the Project Purchasers make such
election, which notice shall be delivered within thirty (30) days of such
date. If an Other NRIS Request is submitted pursuant to this Section 6.22(i)
and the final definitive MISO transmission study results for such Other NRIS
Request provide that in order to obtain the Minimum NRIS for the Project and
each Power Block, Seller would incur NRIS Upgrade Costs estimated to be
greater than $25 million in the aggregate (inclusive of all Committed NRIS
Upgrade Costs), and neither Seller nor the Project Purchasers elect to fund
such NRIS Upgrade Costs pursuant to Section 6.22(f) or Section 6.22(g), then
either Seller or the Project Purchasers may elect to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 6.22(i) by written notice to the Project Purchasers,
if Seller makes such election, or to Seller, if the Project Purchasers make
such election, which notice shall be delivered within thirty (30) days of the
date that that the Parties' right to make such election to fund such NRIS
Upgrade Costs pursuant to Section 6.22(f) or Section 6.22(g), as applicable,
expires. If an Other NRIS Request is submitted pursuant to this Section
6.22(i), the final definitive MISO transmission study results for such Other
NRIS Request provide that Seller may obtain incremental NRIS for the Project
and each Power Block but may not obtain the Minimum NRIS for the Project and
each Power Block and in order to obtain such incremental NRIS for the Project
and each Power Block Seller would incur NRIS Upgrade Costs estimated to be
equal to or greater than $1 and less than $50 million in the aggregate
(inclusive of all Committed NRIS Upgrade Costs), and the Project Purchasers
have not elected to fund such NRIS Upgrade Costs pursuant to Section 6.22(h)
and have not waived the condition to the Closing in Section 7.9, then either
Seller or the Project Purchasers may elect to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 6.22(i) by written notice to the Project Purchasers, 

if Seller makes such election, or to Seller, if the Project Purchasers make
such election, which notice shall be delivered within thirty (30) days of the
date that that the Parties' right to make such election to fund such NRIS
Upgrade Costs pursuant to Section 6.22(h) expires.

(cy)Election to Terminate NRIS Upgrade Agreements. At any time after (i)
Seller or any Project Purchaser has irrevocably determined that the Closing
will not occur, (ii) the Project Purchasers have waived the condition to the
Closing set forth in Section 7.9 or (iii) this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with its terms, the Project Purchasers may instruct Seller to
terminate any of the NRIS Upgrade Agreements relating to the procurement of
incremental NRIS for the Project and each Power Block to the extent the
Project Purchasers have any liability for NRIS Upgrade Costs in connection
therewith. If the Project Purchasers deliver such termination instruction to
Seller, each Project Purchaser shall pay, as and when due, its Undivided Pro
Rata Percentage of all MISO and transmission owner cancellation fees and
charges resulting from such cancellation of such NRIS Upgrade Agreement(s)
(the "NRIS Cancellation Costs"). If the Project Purchasers deliver such
termination instruction to Seller, Seller may, notwithstanding such
termination instruction, within ten (10) days of receiving such termination
instruction, provide the Project Purchasers with written notice of Seller\'s
election to not terminate the NRIS Upgrade Agreement. If Seller makes such an
election, (A) each Project Purchasers\' obligation to pay its Undivided Pro
Rata Percentage of any NRIS Upgrade Costs for obtaining such incremental NRIS
pursuant to such NRIS Upgrade Agreement shall irrevocably terminate and (B)
Seller shall, within thirty (30) days of delivering its election not to
terminate the NRIS Upgrade Agreement, reimburse each Project Purchaser for all
NRIS Upgrade Costs paid by such Project Purchaser for obtaining such
incremental NRIS pursuant to such NRIS Upgrade Agreement; provided that Seller
shall have no reimbursement obligations and Project Purchasers shall remain
liable for all NRIS Cancellation Charges, if any, where Seller's election not
to terminate the NRIS Upgrade Agreements relates solely to any upgrades that
are available without the incurrence of NRIS Upgrade Costs.

(cz)Disputes Regarding NRIS Upgrade or Cancellation Costs. In the event that a
Project Purchaser disputes any NRIS Upgrade Cost or any NRIS Cancellation Cost
charged to Seller and reimbursable or payable by such Project Purchaser, such
Project Purchaser shall notify Seller of such dispute and the basis therefor
and may direct Seller to dispute, at such Project Purchaser's sole cost and
expense, such NRIS Upgrade Cost or NRIS Cancellation Cost, as applicable, in
accordance with the applicable terms of the applicable NRIS Upgrade Agreement
or MISO or transmission owner requirements. If Seller receives any such
notice, Seller shall take commercially reasonable actions to comply with the
instructions therein and shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to enable
the applicable Project Purchaser to communicate directly with the Person
charging the disputed NRIS Upgrade Cost or NRIS Cancellation Cost, as
applicable, and to manage the dispute in its discretion through resolution of
the dispute.

(da)Seller's Re-Payment Obligation. If (i) this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms prior to the Closing, (ii) prior to. on or after

portion of the NRIS Upgrade Costs for such incremental NRIS was paid by the
Project Purchasers, then, Seller shall promptly remit to each Project
Purchaser its Undivided Pro Rata Percentage of (A) a pro rata percentage

transfer of control) of more than two (2) Power Blocks, Seller shall
immediately pay each Project Purchaser the difference, if any, between (i) the

Section 6.24. PB1 Risk of Loss; Casualty Events.

(dg)Prior to the Closing, all risk of loss or damage to the Purchased Assets
shall be borne by Seller, subject to the remainder of this Section 6.24.

(dh)If, prior to the Closing, all or any portion of the PB1 Assets, including
the PB1 Real Property, are damaged or destroyed (such portion of the PB1
Assets so damaged or destroyed, the "PB1 Damaged Portion"), whether by fire,
theft, vandalism, flood, wind, explosion or other casualty (each instance
thereof, a "PB1 Casualty Event") and Seller reasonably expects the PB1 Total
Cost to Repair such PB1 Damaged Portion as required herein to exceed
$1,185,000, then Seller shall notify PB1 Purchaser promptly in writing of such
PB1 Casualty Event (such notice, the "PB1 Casualty Event Notice"). The PB1
Casualty Event Notice shall include (i) the material facts and circumstances
surrounding the PB1 Casualty Event, (ii) a good faith preliminary assessment
of the effect of the PB1 Casualty Event on the Project, the Business and the
PB1 Assets, (iii) Seller's good faith view as to whether such PB1 Damaged
Portion would not reasonably be expected to be Repaired as required herein on
or before the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date and
(iv) whether or not, and the extent to which, the losses sustained as a result
of such PB1 Casualty Event are covered by one or more Project Insurance
Policies then in effect. Seller shall update and revise the information
required to be provided to PB1 Purchaser under this Section 6.24 promptly
after such information becomes known to Seller.

(di)As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days
after PB1 Purchaser\'s receipt of any PB1 Casualty Event Notice, Seller shall
determine, in good faith and in accordance with the next sentence, whether the
PB1 Damaged Portion would reasonably be expected to be Repaired on or before
the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date and the
estimated PB1 Total Cost of such Repair. In order to facilitate such
determination, Seller shall select an Approved Contractor to (i) review the
extent of the damage to or destruction of the PB1 Damaged Portion and estimate
the scope, cost and duration of the work required to Repair the PB1 Damaged
Portion or (ii) agree to perform the work required to Repair the PB1 Damaged
Portion pursuant to a fixed price, lump sum turnkey contract, the terms and
conditions of which, including warranties and guarantees, are reasonably
acceptable to Seller in consultation with PB1 Purchaser. Nothing herein shall
prevent the selection of the Approved Contractor pursuant to a bidding process
if so desired by Seller. Seller and PB1 Purchaser shall accept such estimate
or contract (absent fraud or manifest material error), as applicable, as the
basis of the determination required by the first sentence of this Section
6.24(c). Seller shall be solely responsible for the costs and expenses of
obtaining such estimate or contract (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, the
performance of such contract). "PB1 Total Cost" as used in this Section 6.24
shall mean (i) the total out-of-pocket costs to Repair the PB1 Damaged Portion
less (ii) the sum of any proceeds that Seller and/or Affiliates of Seller
would reasonably be expected to receive from the applicable Project Insurance
Policies in respect of such PB1 Damaged Portion (excluding business
interruption insurance).

(dj)(i) If Seller determines, pursuant to Section 6.24(c), that the PB1
Damaged Portion would reasonably be expected to be Repaired as required herein
on or before the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date for
a PB1 Total Cost of $1,185,000 or less, then (A) Seller shall bear the costs
of and, as between Seller and PB1 Purchaser, exclusive responsibility for
Repairing the PB1 Damaged Portion, on or before the date that is sixty (60)
days prior to the Expiration Date, (B) Seller shall promptly commence and
diligently pursue such Repair, until completion thereof, in accordance with
the applicable terms of this Agreement, including Section 6.1, and (C) the
Closing 

shall be delayed for such reasonable time as is necessary to accomplish the
completion of such Repair, but in no event shall such completion be later than
sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date, and subject to Section 6.24(e),
Seller shall be entitled to any and all proceeds of Project Insurance Policies
with respect to such PB1 Casualty Event whether paid prior to, at or following
Closing and PB1 Purchaser hereby agrees to hold any such proceeds in trust for
Seller and promptly pay the same over to Seller.

(i)If Seller determines pursuant to Section 6.24(c) that the PB1 Damaged
Portion would reasonably be expected to be Repaired as required herein on or
before the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date for a PB1
Total Cost of greater than $1,185,000 but less than $16,590,000, then Seller
shall elect to either (A) bear the costs of and, as between Seller and PB1
Purchaser, exclusive responsibility for Repairing the PB1 Damaged Portion, on
or before the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date, and
shall promptly commence and diligently pursue such Repair, until completion
thereof, in accordance with the applicable terms of this Agreement, including
Section 6.1, or (B) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to the
Closing in Article VII and Article VIII, (1) proceed with the Transactions,
(2) reduce the PB1 Purchase Price by the estimated PB1 Total Cost of such
Repair as determined in accordance with this Section 6.24, (3) further reduce
the PB1 Purchase Price by the sum of (x) all proceeds Seller or any Affiliate
of Seller has received from the applicable Project Insurance Policy prior to
the Closing in respect of such PB1 Damaged Portion (excluding business
interruption insurance), (y) the aggregate amount of all undisputed covered
claims arising out of the PB1 Casualty Event made by Seller or any of its
Affiliates under the applicable Project Insurance Policies, to the extent
proceeds from such claims have not been received by, but will be paid to,
Seller or any of its Affiliates as of the Closing and (z) the aggregate value
of all lost net revenues reasonably expected to accrue in respect of PB1 after
the Closing as a result of such PB1 Damaged Portion as determined by an
Approved Valuation Firm, (4) transfer or cause to be transferred to PB1
Purchaser at the Closing, for no additional consideration, the irrevocable
right to (x) all proceeds to which Seller or any Affiliate of Seller may be
entitled after the Closing from the applicable Project Insurance Policy in
respect of the applicable PB1 Damaged Portion (excluding business interruption
insurance), other than such proceeds for which the PB1 Purchase Price was
reduced pursuant to clause (3)(y) above, and (y) any and all rights (including
defenses), claims and causes of action of any kind that Seller or any of its
Affiliates may have against any insurer or third party for damages or losses
to the extent arising out such PB1 Casualty Event and allocable to the period
after the Closing and (5) preserve and maintain the Project in its then-
current state in accordance with the applicable terms of this Agreement
pending the Closing. If Seller elects to Repair the PB1 Damaged Portion
pursuant to Section 6.24(d)(ii)(A), the Closing shall be delayed for such
reasonable time as is necessary to accomplish the completion of such Repair,
but in no event shall such completion be later than the date that is sixty
(60) days prior to the Expiration Date, and subject to Section 6.24(e), Seller
shall be entitled to any and all proceeds of Project Insurance Policies with
respect to such PB1 Casualty Event whether paid prior to, at or following
Closing.

(ii)If Seller determines pursuant to Section 6.24(c) that the PB1 Damaged
Portion would not reasonably be expected to be Repaired as required herein for
a PB1 Total Cost of $16,590,000 or less, then either Seller or PB1 Purchaser
may terminate this Agreement. Each of Seller or PB1 Purchaser, as applicable,
shall notify the other in writing of any termination of this Agreement elected
by such Party pursuant to this Section 6.24(d)(iii) as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the
determination described in the first sentence of this Section 6.24(d)(iii) is
made. If neither Seller nor PB1 Purchaser elects to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 6.24(d)(iii) on or before the last day of such sixty
(60) day period, each of Seller and PB1 Purchaser shall be deemed to have
waived its right to terminate in respect of such PB1 Casualty Event under this
Section 6.24(d)(iii). 

(iii)If Seller determines pursuant to Section 6.24(c) that the PB1 Damaged
Portion would reasonably be expected to be Repaired as required herein for a
PB1 Total Cost of $16,590,000 or less but would not reasonably be expected to
be Repaired as required herein on or before the date that is sixty (60) days
prior to the Expiration Date, then Seller and PB1 Purchaser shall, subject to
the satisfaction of the conditions to the Closing in Article VII and Article
VIII, (A) proceed with the Transactions, (B) reduce the PB1 Purchase Price by
the estimated PB1 Total Cost of such Repair as determined in accordance with
this Section 6.24, (C) further reduce the PB1 Purchase Price by the sum of (1)
all proceeds Seller or any Affiliate of Seller has received from the
applicable Project Insurance Policy prior to the Closing in respect of the

PB1 Casualty Event made by Seller or any of its Affiliates under the
applicable Project Insurance Policies, to the extent proceeds from such claims
have not been received by, but will be paid to, Seller or any of its
Affiliates as of the Closing and (3) the aggregate value of all lost net
revenues reasonably expected to accrue in respect of PB1 after the Closing as
a result of such PB1 Damaged Portion as determined by an Approved Valuation
Firm, (D) transfer or cause to be transferred to PB1 Purchaser at the Closing,
for no additional consideration, the irrevocable right to (1) all proceeds to
which Seller or any Affiliate of Seller may be entitled after the Closing from
the applicable Project Insurance Policy in respect of the applicable PB1
Damaged Portion (excluding business interruption insurance), other than such
proceeds for which the PB1 Purchase Price was reduced pursuant to clause
(C)(2), and (2) any and all rights (including defenses), claims and causes of
action of any kind that Seller or any of its Affiliates may have against any
insurer or third party for damages or losses to the extent arising out such
PB1 Casualty Event and allocable to the period after the Closing and (E)
preserve and maintain the Project in its then-current state in accordance with
the applicable terms of this Agreement pending the Closing.

(dk)If Seller undertakes the Repair of a PB1 Damaged Portion pursuant to this
Section 6.24, and, despite Seller\'s compliance with the terms hereof, such
PB1 Damaged Portion is not Repaired in accordance the applicable requirements
of this Agreement on or before the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the
Expiration Date, then Seller and PB1 Purchaser shall, subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions to the Closing in Article VII and Article VIII,
proceed with the Transactions, and PB1 Purchaser shall, in its sole and
absolute discretion, elect to either (i) require Seller to complete (or cause
the completion of) such Repair after the Closing as provided herein at
Seller\'s expense or (ii) (A) complete such Repair as required herein after
the Closing at its (i.e., PB1 Purchaser\'s) own expense, (B) reduce the PB1
Purchase Price by the positive difference, if any, of (1) the sum of the
amount of the proceeds received by Seller and its Affiliates from the

documented out-of-pocket costs expended by Seller on the Repair of such PB1

be transferred to PB1 Purchaser at the Closing the irrevocable right to all
rights (including defenses), claims and causes of action that Seller and its

to the extent arising out such PB1 Casualty Event and allocable to the period
after the Closing.

(dv)For purposes of this Section 6.25, any PB2 Damaged Portion that
constitutes parts, machinery, equipment, facilities, systems or others items
shall not be considered Repaired if (i) such "Repair" is temporary or
transitional in nature or such parts, machinery, equipment, facilities,
systems or other items are not, in all material respects, safely and properly
connected to, or integrated and operating safely and properly with, the other
machinery, equipment, facilities, systems and/or items to which it is
connected or integrated or with which it operates, or (ii) the operating

Event or "Repair."

(dw)Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with PB2
Purchaser and to include PB2 Purchaser in meetings, communications and
inspections relating to any Repair conducted under this Section 6.25 (other

performed in accordance with the applicable terms of this Agreement.

(dx)If any PB2 Casualty Event has occurred, then, provided Seller complies
with this Section 6.25 with respect to such PB2 Casualty Event, Seller shall
not be deemed to be in breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in
this Agreement nor shall such PB2 Casualty Event constitute a Material Adverse

Section 6.26. PB3 Risk of Loss; Casualty Events.

(dy)Prior to the Closing, all risk of loss or damage to the Purchased Assets
shall be borne by Seller, subject to the remainder of this Section 6.26.

(dz)If, prior to the Closing, all or any portion of the PB3 Assets, including
the PB3 Real Property, are damaged or destroyed (such portion of the PB3
Assets so damaged or destroyed, the "PB3 Damaged Portion"), whether by fire,
theft, vandalism, flood, wind, explosion or other casualty (each instance
thereof, a "PB3 Casualty Event") and Seller reasonably expects the PB3 Total
Cost to Repair such PB3 Damaged Portion as required herein to exceed
$1,185,000, then Seller shall notify PB3 Purchaser promptly in writing of such
PB3 Casualty Event (such notice, the "PB3 Casualty Event Notice"). The PB3
Casualty Event Notice shall include (i) the material facts and circumstances
surrounding the PB3 Casualty Event, (ii) a good faith preliminary assessment
of the effect of the PB3 Casualty Event on the Project, the Business and the
PB3 Assets, (iii) Seller's good faith view as to whether such PB3 Damaged
Portion would not reasonably be expected to be Repaired as required herein on
or before the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date and
(iv) whether or not, and the extent to which, the losses sustained as a result
of such PB3 Casualty Event are covered by one or more Project Insurance
Policies then in effect. Seller shall update and revise the information
required to be provided to PB3 Purchaser under this Section 6.26 promptly
after such information becomes known to Seller.

(ea)As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days
after PB3 Purchaser\'s receipt of any PB3 Casualty Event Notice, Seller shall
determine, in good faith and in accordance with the next sentence, whether the
PB3 Damaged Portion would reasonably be expected to be Repaired on or before
the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date and the
estimated PB3 Total Cost of such Repair. In order to facilitate such
determination, Seller shall select an Approved Contractor to (i) review the
extent of the damage to or destruction of the PB3 Damaged Portion and estimate
the scope, cost and duration of the work required to Repair the PB3 Damaged
Portion or (ii) agree to perform the work required 

to Repair the PB3 Damaged Portion pursuant to a fixed price, lump sum turnkey
contract, the terms and conditions of which, including warranties and
guarantees, are reasonably acceptable to Seller in consultation with PB3
Purchaser. Nothing herein shall prevent the selection of the Approved
Contractor pursuant to a bidding process if so desired by Seller. Seller and
PB3 Purchaser shall accept such estimate or contract (absent fraud or manifest
material error), as applicable, as the basis of the determination required by
the first sentence of this Section 6.26(c). Seller shall be solely responsible
for the costs and expenses of obtaining such estimate or contract (but not,
for the avoidance of doubt, the performance of such contract). "PB3 Total
Cost" as used in this Section 6.26 shall mean (i) the total out-of-pocket
costs to Repair the PB3 Damaged Portion less (ii) the sum of any proceeds that
Seller and/or Affiliates of Seller would reasonably be expected to receive
from the applicable Project Insurance Policies in respect of such PB3 Damaged
Portion (excluding business interruption insurance).

(eb)(i) If Seller determines, pursuant to Section 6.26(c), that the PB3
Damaged Portion would reasonably be expected to be Repaired as required herein
on or before the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date for
a PB3 Total Cost of $1,185,000 or less, then (A) Seller shall bear the costs
of and, as between Seller and PB3 Purchaser, exclusive responsibility for
Repairing the PB3 Damaged Portion, on or before the date that is sixty (60)
days prior to the Expiration Date, (B) Seller shall promptly commence and
diligently pursue such Repair, until completion thereof, in accordance with
the applicable terms of this Agreement, including Section 6.1, and (C) the
Closing shall be delayed for such reasonable time as is necessary to
accomplish the completion of such Repair, but in no event shall such
completion be later than sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date, and
subject to Section 6.26(e), Seller shall be entitled to any and all proceeds
of Project Insurance Policies with respect to such PB3 Casualty Event whether
paid prior to, at or following Closing and PB3 Purchaser hereby agrees to hold
any such proceeds in trust for Seller and promptly pay the same over to
Seller.

(i)If Seller determines pursuant to Section 6.26(c) that the PB3 Damaged
Portion would reasonably be expected to be Repaired as required herein on or
before the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date for a PB3
Total Cost of greater than $1,185,000 but less than $16,590,000, then Seller
shall elect to either (A) bear the costs of and, as between Seller and PB3
Purchaser, exclusive responsibility for Repairing the PB3 Damaged Portion, on
or before the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date, and
shall promptly commence and diligently pursue such Repair, until completion
thereof, in accordance with the applicable terms of this Agreement, including

Closing in Article VII and Article VIII, (1) proceed with the Transactions,
(2) reduce the PB3 Purchase Price by the estimated PB3 Total Cost of such
Repair as determined in accordance with this Section 6.26, (3) further reduce
the PB3 Purchase Price by the sum of (x) all proceeds Seller or any Affiliate
of Seller has received from the applicable Project Insurance Policy prior to
the Closing in respect of such PB3 Damaged Portion (excluding business
interruption insurance), (y) the aggregate amount of all undisputed covered

Affiliates under the applicable Project Insurance Policies, to the extent
proceeds from such claims have not been received by, but will be paid to,
Seller or any of its Affiliates as of the Closing and (z) the aggregate value
of all lost net revenues reasonably expected to accrue in respect of PB3 after
the Closing as a result of such PB3 Damaged Portion as determined by an
Approved Valuation Firm, (4) transfer or cause to be transferred to PB3
Purchaser at the Closing, for no additional consideration, the irrevocable
right to (x) all proceeds to which Seller or any Affiliate of Seller may be
entitled after the Closing from the applicable Project Insurance Policy in
respect of the applicable PB3 Damaged Portion (excluding business interruption
insurance), other than such proceeds for which the PB3 Purchase Price was
reduced pursuant to clause (3)(y) above, and (y) any and all rights (including
defenses), claims and causes of action of any kind that Seller or any of its
Affiliates may have against any insurer or third party for damages or losses
to the extent arising out such PB3 Casualty Event 

and allocable to the period after the Closing and (5) preserve and maintain
the Project in its then-current state in accordance with the applicable terms
of this Agreement pending the Closing. If Seller elects to Repair the PB3
Damaged Portion pursuant to Section 6.26(d)(ii)(A), the Closing shall be
delayed for such reasonable time as is necessary to accomplish the completion
of such Repair, but in no event shall such completion be later than the date
that is sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date, and subject to Section
6.26(e), Seller shall be entitled to any and all proceeds of Project Insurance
Policies with respect to such PB3 Casualty Event whether paid prior to, at or
following Closing.

(ii)If Seller determines pursuant to Section 6.26(c) that the PB3 Damaged
Portion would not reasonably be expected to be Repaired as required herein for
a PB3 Total Cost of $16,590,000 or less, then either Seller or PB3 Purchaser
may terminate this Agreement. Each of Seller or PB3 Purchaser, as applicable,
shall notify the other in writing of any termination of this Agreement elected
by such Party pursuant to this Section 6.26(d)(iii) as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the
determination described in the first sentence of this Section 6.26(d)(iii) is
made. If neither Seller nor PB3 Purchaser elects to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 6.26(d)(iii) on or before the last day of such sixty
(60) day period, each of Seller and PB3 Purchaser shall be deemed to have
waived its right to terminate in respect of such PB3 Casualty Event under this
Section 6.26(d)(iii).

Portion would reasonably be expected to be Repaired as required herein for a
PB3 Total Cost of $16,590,000 or less but would not reasonably be expected to

performed in accordance with the applicable terms of this Agreement.

(ep)If any PB4 Casualty Event has occurred, then, provided Seller complies
with this Section 6.27 with respect to such PB4 Casualty Event, Seller shall
not be deemed to be in breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in

Section 6.28. Common Facilities Risk of Loss; Casualty Events.

(eq)Prior to the Closing, all risk of loss or damage to the Common Facilities
Assets shall be borne by Seller, subject to the remainder of this Section
6.28.

(er)If, prior to the Closing, all or any portion of the Common Facilities
Assets, including the Common Facilities Real Property, are damaged or
destroyed (such portion of the Common Facilities Assets so damaged or
destroyed, the "Common Facilities Damaged Portion"), whether by fire, theft, 

vandalism, flood, wind, explosion or other casualty (each instance thereof, a
"Common Facilities Casualty Event") and Seller reasonably expects the Common
Facilities Total Cost to Repair such Common Facilities Damaged Portion as
required herein to exceed $1,185,000 (such notice, the "Common Facilities
Casualty Event Notice"). The Common Facilities Casualty Event Notice shall
include (i) the material facts and circumstances surrounding the Common
Facilities Casualty Event, (ii) a good faith preliminary assessment of the
effect of the Common Facilities Casualty Event on the Project, the Business
and the Common Facilities Assets, (iii) Seller's good faith view as to whether
such Common Facilities Damaged Portion would not reasonably be expected to be
Repaired as required herein on or before the date that is sixty (60) days
prior to the Expiration Date and (iv) whether or not, and the extent to which,
the losses sustained as a result of such Common Facilities Casualty Event are
covered by one or more Project Insurance Policies then in effect. Seller shall
update and revise the information required to be provided to the Project
Purchasers under this Section 6.28 promptly after such information becomes
known to Seller.

(es)As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days
after the Project Purchasers\' receipt of any Common Facilities Casualty Event
Notice, Seller shall determine, in good faith and in accordance with the next
sentence, whether the Common Facilities Damaged Portion would reasonably be
expected to be Repaired on or before the date that is sixty (60) days prior to
the Expiration Date and the estimated Common Facilities Total Cost of such
Repair. In order to facilitate such determination, Seller shall select an
Approved Contractor to (i) review the extent of the damage to or destruction
of the Common Facilities Damaged Portion and estimate the scope, cost and
duration of the work required to Repair the Common Facilities Damaged Portion
or (ii) agree to perform the work required to Repair the Common Facilities
Damaged Portion pursuant to a fixed price, lump sum turnkey contract, the
terms and conditions of which, including warranties and guarantees, are
reasonably acceptable to Seller in consultation with the Project Purchasers.
Nothing herein shall prevent the selection of the Approved Contractor pursuant
to a bidding process if so desired by Seller. Seller and the Project
Purchasers shall accept such estimate or contract (absent fraud or manifest
material error), as applicable, as the basis of the determination required by
the first sentence of this Section 6.28(c). Seller shall be solely responsible
for the costs and expenses of obtaining such estimate or contract (but not,
for the avoidance of doubt, the performance of such contract). "Common
Facilities Total Cost" as used in this Section 6.28 shall mean (i) the total
out-of-pocket costs to Repair the Common Facilities Damaged Portion less (ii)
the sum of any proceeds that Seller and/or Affiliates of Seller would
reasonably be expected to receive from the applicable Project Insurance
Policies in respect of such Common Facilities Damaged Portion (excluding
business interruption insurance).

(et)(i) If Seller determines, pursuant to Section 6.28(c), that the Common
Facilities Damaged Portion would reasonably be expected to be Repaired as
required herein on or before the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the
Expiration Date for a Common Facilities Total Cost of $1,185,000 or less, then
(A) Seller shall bear the costs of and, as between Seller and each Project
Purchaser, exclusive responsibility for Repairing the Common Facilities
Damaged Portion, on or before the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the
Expiration Date, (B) Seller shall promptly commence and diligently pursue such
Repair, until completion thereof, in accordance with the applicable terms of
this Agreement, including Section 6.1, and (C) the Closing shall be delayed
for such reasonable time as is necessary to accomplish the completion of such
Repair, but in no event shall such completion be later than sixty (60) days
prior to the Expiration Date, and subject to Section 6.28(e), Seller shall be
entitled to any and all proceeds of Project Insurance Policies with respect to
such Common Facilities Casualty Event whether paid prior to, at or following
Closing and each Project Purchaser hereby agrees to hold any such proceeds in
trust for Seller and promptly pay the same over to Seller.

(i)If Seller determines pursuant to Section 6.28(c) that the Common Facilities
Damaged Portion would reasonably be expected to be Repaired as required herein
on or before the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date for
a Common Facilities Total Cost of greater than $1,185,000 but less than
$16,590,000, Seller shall elect to either (A) bear the costs of and, as
between Seller and each Project Purchaser, exclusive responsibility for
Repairing the Common 

Facilities Damaged Portion, on or before the date that is sixty (60) days
prior to the Expiration Date, and shall promptly commence and diligently
pursue such Repair, until completion thereof, in accordance with the
applicable terms of this Agreement, including Section 6.1, or (B) subject to
the satisfaction of the conditions to the Closing in Article VII and Article
VIII, (1) proceed with the Transactions, (2) reduce each of the PB1 Purchase
Price, the PB2 Purchase Price, the PB3 Purchase Price and the PB4 Purchase
Price by an amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the estimated Common
Facilities Total Cost of such Repair as determined in accordance with this
Section 6.28, (3) further reduce the each of the PB1 Purchase Price, the PB2
Purchase Price, the PB3 Purchase Price and the PB4 Purchase Price by an amount
equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the sum of (x) all proceeds Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller has received from the applicable Project Insurance
Policy prior to the Closing in respect of such Common Facilities Damaged
Portion (excluding business interruption insurance), (y) the aggregate amount
of all undisputed covered claims arising out of the Common Facilities Casualty
Event made by Seller or any of its Affiliates under the applicable Project
Insurance Policies, to the extent proceeds from such claims have not been
received by, but will be paid to, Seller or any of its Affiliates as of the
Closing and (z) the aggregate value of all lost net revenues reasonably
expected to accrue in respect of the Project after the Closing as a result of
such Common Facilities Damaged Portion as determined by an Approved Valuation
Firm, (4) transfer or cause to be transferred to each Project Purchaser at the
Closing, for no additional consideration, the irrevocable right to its
Undivided Pro Rata Percentage of (x) all proceeds to which Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller may be entitled after the Closing from the applicable
Project Insurance Policy in respect of the applicable Common Facilities
Damaged Portion (excluding business interruption insurance), other than such
proceeds for which the PB1 Purchase Price, the PB2 Purchase Price, the PB3
Purchase Price and the PB4 Purchase Price were reduced pursuant to clause
(3)(y) above, and (y) any and all rights (including defenses), claims and
causes of action of any kind that Seller or any of its Affiliates may have
against any insurer or third party for damages or losses to the extent arising
out such Common Facilities Casualty Event and allocable to the period after
the Closing and (5) preserve and maintain the Project in its then-current
state in accordance with the applicable terms of this Agreement pending the
Closing. If Seller elects to Repair the Common Facilities Damaged Portion
pursuant to Section 6.28(d)(ii)(A), the Closing shall be delayed for such
reasonable time as is necessary to accomplish the completion of such Repair,
but in no event shall such completion be later than the date that is sixty
(60) days prior to the Expiration Date, and subject to Section 6.28(e), Seller
shall be entitled to any and all proceeds of Project Insurance Policies with
respect to such Common Facilities Casualty Event whether paid prior to, at or
following Closing.

(ii)If Seller determines pursuant to Section 6.28(c) that the Common
Facilities Damaged Portion would not reasonably be expected to be Repaired as
required herein for a Common Facilities Total Cost of $16,590,000 or less,
then either Seller or any Project Purchaser may terminate this Agreement. Each
of Seller or the Project Purchasers, as applicable, shall notify the other in
writing of any termination of this Agreement elected by such Party pursuant to
this Section 6.28(d)(iii) as promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than sixty (60) days after the determination described in the first sentence
of this Section 6.28(d)(iii) is made. If neither Seller nor any Project
Purchaser elects to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
6.28(d)(iii) on or before the last day of such sixty (60) day period, each of
Seller and the Project Purchasers shall be deemed to have waived its right to
terminate in respect of such Common Facilities Casualty Event under this
Section 6.28(d)(iii).

(iii)If Seller determines pursuant to Section 6.28(c) that the Common
Facilities Damaged Portion would reasonably be expected to be Repaired as
required herein for a Common Facilities Total Cost of $16,590,000 or less but
would not reasonably be expected to be Repaired as required herein on or

conditions to the Closing in Article 

VII and Article VIII, (A) proceed with the Transactions, (B) reduce each of

revenues reasonably expected to accrue in respect of the Project after the
Closing as a result of such Common Facilities Damaged Portion as determined by
an Approved Valuation Firm, (D) transfer or cause to be transferred to each
Project Purchaser at the Closing, for no additional consideration, the
irrevocable right to its Undivided Pro Rata Percentage of (1) all proceeds to
which Seller or any Affiliate of Seller may be entitled after the Closing from

Section 9.2, Section 9.3, Section 9.4, Section 9.5, Section 9.6, Section 9.7
or Section 9.8, as applicable, and whether the Indemnitor has made the
irrevocable election to defend and indemnify the Indemnitee against such Third
Party Claim, subject to the other terms of this Article IX. The failure of the
Indemnitor to provide such notice within the Notice Period shall be deemed a
refusal to provide the requested indemnity and defense to such Third Party
Claim.

(ah)If the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee within the Notice Period of its
irrevocable election to defend and indemnify the Indemnitee (subject to the
other terms of this Article IX) with respect to the Third Party Claim, then,
except as hereinafter provided, the Indemnitor shall have the right to contest
and defend, at its sole cost and expense, with counsel of its choosing that is
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee, any such Third Party Claim by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and diligently
prosecuted by the Indemnitor to a final conclusion or will be settled at the
discretion of Indemnitor (but only with the consent of the Indemnitee in the
case of any settlement or compromise that (i) provides for relief other than
the payment of monetary damages as to which the Indemnitee will be indemnified
in full, (ii) does not include, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a release, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Indemnitee, from all liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim or (iii) contains an admission or acknowledgment of
guilt or criminal wrongdoing or a violation of any Law by any member of the
indemnified Seller Group, PB1 Purchaser Group, PB2 Purchaser Group, PB3
Purchaser Group or PB4 Purchaser Group, as applicable). Subject to the other
terms of this Section 9.12, the Indemnitor will have full control of such
defense and proceedings, including (except as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence) any settlement thereof. If the Indemnitee desires to
participate in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any Third Party
Claim that the Indemnitor is defending under this Section 9.12, it may do so
at its sole cost and expense with counsel of its choosing that is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitor; provided, however, that the Indemnitor will pay
the reasonable out-of pocket costs and expenses of such separate counsel only
if (x) in the Indemnitee\'s good faith judgment, it is advisable, based on
advice of counsel, for the Indemnitee to be represented by separate counsel
because a conflict or potential conflict exists between the Indemnitor and the
Indemnitee or (y) the named parties to such Third Party Claim include both the
Indemnitor and the Indemnitee and the Indemnitee determines in good faith,
based on advice of counsel, that defenses are available to it that are
unavailable to the Indemnitor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee
may retain or take over the control of the defense or settlement of any Third
Party Claim the defense of which the Indemnitor has elected to control if the
Indemnitee irrevocably waives its right to indemnity under Section 9.1,
Section 9.2, Section 9.3, Section 9.4, Section 9.5, Section 9.6, Section 9.7
or Section 9.8, as applicable, with respect to such Third Party Claim.

(ai)The Party defending the Third Party Claim (the "Defending Party") in
accordance with this Section 9.12, and such Party\'s counsel and
representatives, shall consult with the other Party (the "Non-Defending
Party"), and such Party\'s counsel and representatives, throughout the
pendency of the Third Party Claim regarding the investigation, defense,
settlement, trial, appeal or other resolution of the Third Party Claim. The
Parties shall cooperate in the defense of the Third Party Claim. The Party
shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours and following
reasonable notice, to Employees of the Non-Defending Party who may have
knowledge, material, documents or information relevant to the defense of any
Third Party Claim. The Non-Defending Party shall make available to the
Defending Party, at reasonable times and for reasonable periods, its Employees
and Representatives and such information, books, and records and other
materials in the Non-Defending Party\'s possession or control and reasonably
required by the Defending Party for use in contesting any Third Party Claim
(subject to obtaining an agreement to maintain 

the confidentiality of confidential or proprietary materials in a form
reasonably acceptable to both the Defending and Non-Defending Parties). If and
to the extent reasonably requested by the Defending Party, the Non-Defending
Party shall cooperate with the Defending Party and its counsel in contesting
such Third Party Claim or, if appropriate, in making any counterclaim against
the Person asserting the Third Party Claim, or any cross-complaint relating to
such Third Party Claim against any other Person. The Defending Party shall
reimburse the Non-Defending Party for any reasonable, documented out‑of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Non-Defending Party in cooperating with or acting at
the request of the Defending Party.

(aj)If with respect to any Third Party Claim (i) the Indemnitor fails to
notify the Indemnitee within the Notice Period that the Indemnitor desires to
defend such Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 9.12(b), (ii) the Indemnitor
gives such notice but fails to defend vigorously and diligently such Third
Party Claim, (iii) such Third Party Claim (or the facts or allegations related
to such Third Party Claim) involves criminal allegations or seeks equitable or
injunctive relief or (iv) the Indemnitor does not have the resources to
satisfy such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnitee will have the right to
defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor, the Third Party Claim
by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the
Indemnitee in good faith or will be settled at the discretion of the
Indemnitee (with the consent of the Indemnitor, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnitee will have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including (except as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence) any settlement thereof; provided, however,
that if requested by the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor will, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnitor, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnitee
and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnitee is
contesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause (e), if
the Indemnitor has notified the Indemnitee within the Notice Period that the
Indemnitor disputes its liability hereunder to the Indemnitee with respect to
such Third Party Claim and if such dispute is resolved in favor of the
Indemnitor in the manner provided in clause (f) below, the Indemnitor will not
be required to bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnitee\'s defense
pursuant to this clause (e) or of the Indemnitor\'s participation therein at
the Indemnitee\'s request, and the Indemnitee will reimburse the Indemnitor in
full for all reasonable, document out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
the Indemnitee in connection with such litigation.

(ak)If the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee that it does not dispute its
liability to the Indemnitee with respect to the Third Party Claim under
Section 9.1, Section 9.2, Section 9.3, Section 9.4, Section 9.5, Section 9.6,
Section 9.7 or Section 9.8, as applicable, or fails to notify the Indemnitee
within the Notice Period whether the Indemnitor disputes its liability to the
Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party Claim, the Loss arising from such
Third Party Claim will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnitor
under Section 9.1, Section 9.2, Section 9.3, Section 9.4, Section 9.5, Section
9.6, Section 9.7 or Section 9.8, as applicable, and, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article IX, the Indemnitor shall pay the amount
of such Loss to the Indemnitee on demand following the final determination
thereof. If the Indemnitor has timely disputed its liability with respect to
such claim, the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee will proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through
negotiations within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be resolved by
litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section
11.6.

(al)In the event any Indemnitee should have a claim under Section 9.1, Section
9.2, Section 9.3, Section 9.4, Section 9.5, Section 9.6, Section 9.7 or
Section 9.8, as applicable, against any Indemnitor that does not involve a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall deliver an Indemnity Notice with
reasonable promptness to the Indemnitor. The failure by any Indemnitee to give
the Indemnity Notice shall not impair such party\'s rights hereunder except to
the extent that an Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been
irreparably prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee that
it does not dispute the claim described in such Indemnity Notice or fails to
notify the Indemnitee within the Notice Period whether the Indemnitor disputes
the claim described in such Indemnity Notice, the Loss arising from the claim
specified in such Indemnity Notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of
the Indemnitor under Section 9.1, Section 9.2, Section 9.3, Section 9.4,
Section 9.5, Section 9.6, Section 9.7 or Section 9.8, as applicable, and the 

Indemnitor shall pay the amount of such Loss, as determined under this Article
IX, to the Indemnitee on demand following the final determination thereof. If
the Indemnitor has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim,
the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee will proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within
the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in a court
of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section 11.6.

Section 9.13. Purchase Price Adjustment; Payment Address

. Any and all payments required to be made under this Article IX shall be
deemed adjustments to the PB1 Purchase Price, PB2 Purchase Price, PB3 Purchase
Price or PB4 Purchaser Price, as applicable. Any indemnification payment
hereunder shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such account(s) as the Indemnitee may designate to the Indemnitor in writing.

Section 9.14. Subrogation

. Upon the payment in full of the amounts due to the Indemnitee in respect of
any Third Party Claim as provided herein, the Indemnitor shall be subrogated
in place of the Indemnitee with respect to any right of action that the
Indemnitee may have with respect to the specific subject matter giving rise
the claim of indemnification hereunder.

Section 9.15. Cooperation; Mitigation

. The Seller Group shall reasonably cooperate with Purchasers, and the PB1
Purchaser Group, PB2 Purchaser Group, PB3 Purchaser Group, and PB4 Purchaser
Group shall reasonably cooperate with Seller, and each such Indemnitee shall
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to mitigate any and all Losses subject to
indemnification hereunder, including, using Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
recover under any insurance policy (including, under each applicable Title
Policy) or under any contractual right of set-off or indemnity; provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no member of the
PB1 Purchaser Group, the PB2 Purchaser Group, the PB3 Purchaser Group or the
PB4 Purchaser Group Indemnitees shall have any obligation to seek recoveries
under any Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy.

Section 9.16. Exclusive Remedy

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, following the
Closing, except as provided in Section 9.17, the indemnification provisions of
this Agreement are the sole and exclusive remedies for any Losses arising from
or relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Transactions.
In furtherance of the foregoing, all other rights or remedies available at law
or in equity, in tort, contract or otherwise are hereby waived, released and
discharged by each Party.

Section 9.17. Specific Performance

. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the Transactions are unique and
that the other Parties will be irreparably injured should such Transactions
not be consummated in a timely fashion and will not have an adequate remedy at
law if Seller shall fail to sell, or any Purchaser shall fail to purchase, as
the case may be, the portion of the Purchased Assets which Seller or such
Purchaser is to sell or purchase, as applicable, when required to do so
hereunder. In such event, prior to the Closing, and with respect to all
obligations arising under clauses (b) and (c) of Section 6.15
(Confidentiality; Public Announcements), Section 6.19 (MISO Specific
Covenants), Section 6.20 (MISO Requirements), Section 6.22 (Transmission
Upgrades) and Section 6.23 (Capacity Release), prior to and after the Closing,
each such other Party shall have the right, in addition to any other remedy
available in equity or law but subject to the terms of this Agreement, to
specific performance of such obligation by the non-performing Party, subject
to such other Party\'s performance of its obligations hereunder.

Section 9.18. Waiver of Certain Damages; Non-Recourse

. 

(am)In no event shall any Party or any of its Affiliates be liable to the
other Party or any of its Affiliates for punitive, incidental, indirect, or
special damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply
to (i) any PB1 Purchaser Claim, PB2 Purchaser Claim, PB3 Purchaser Claim, PB4
Purchaser Claim, Seller PB1 Purchaser Claim, Seller PB2 Purchaser Claim,
Seller PB3 Purchaser Claim or Seller PB4 Purchaser Claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Article IX for any punitive, incidental, indirect, or special
damages owed to a third person under a Third Party Claim or (ii) any action
pursuant to Section 9.17 by Seller for the PB1 Purchase Price, the PB2
Purchase Price, the PB3 Purchase Price or the PB4 Purchase Price, as
applicable.

(an)Without regard to any bankruptcy of Seller, Entegra TC or any of their
respective Affiliates, none of the current, former or future directors,
officers, agents, Affiliates, limited partners, general partners, members,
managers, employees, stockholders, equity holders or control persons of any
Party and its Affiliates (any such Person, a "Non-Recourse Party") will be
liable whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements or for, or with respect to, or in connection with the liabilities
of any Party under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, and no
such liabilities will attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any
Non-Recourse Party, whether by the enforcement of any judgment or assessment
or pursuant to any claim or any Action at Law or in equity, or otherwise;
provided, however, that nothing contained in this clause (b) shall relieve any
Party or Entegra TC of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any of
the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 9.19. Escrow Accounts

.

(ao)Any indemnification obligations of Seller for Losses incurred under
Section 9.1(a) shall be satisfied first from amounts in the PB1 Escrow
Account, second, from any applicable Representation and Warranty Insurance
Policy, and thereafter, by Seller or Entegra TC, in each case subject to the
limitations on liability set forth in this Article IX.

(ap)Any indemnification obligations of Seller for Losses incurred under
Section 9.2(a) shall be satisfied first from amounts in the PB2 Escrow
Account, second, from any applicable Representation and Warranty Insurance

Section 9.4(a) shall be satisfied first from amounts in the PB4 Escrow
Account, second, from any applicable Representation and Warranty Insurance

contain the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
Transactions, and such agreements supersede all negotiations, representations,
warranties, commitments, offers, contracts and writings prior to the Effective
Date, written or oral (including the Letter of Intent); provided, however, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereby agree that the Confidentiality
Agreement and, to the extent executed prior to the Effective Date, any
Ancillary Agreements, shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms on and after the Effective Date and the Ancillary Agreements shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms on and after

Section 11.2. Schedules

.

(a)Each Party may, from time to time prior to the Closing, notify the other of
any change or addition to any of the Schedules to this Agreement with respect
to any matter arising or discovered after the Effective Date by the delivery
to the other of any amendment or supplement thereto, as of a reasonably
current date prior to the Closing, but each Party shall in any event at least
once, not earlier than ten (10) Business Days and not later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing, so notify the other of all such changes of
such Party; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, (i) Seller shall not have the right to change, or add to,

and absolute discretion, Schedule 2.5(f) without the prior written consent of
PB2 Purchaser in its sole and absolute discretion, Schedule 2.9(f) without the
prior written consent of PB3 Purchaser in its sole and absolute discretion,

entered into by Seller after the Effective Date in accordance with Section
2.1(f), Section 2.5(f), Section 2.9(f), Section 2.13(f) or Section 2.17(f), as
applicable. Each such notification, change, addition, amendment or supplement
pursuant to this Section 11.2 (i) by Seller 

shall have no effect for purposes of determining whether each Purchaser\'s
conditions to Closing set forth in Article VII have been fulfilled and (ii) by
any Purchaser shall have no effect for purposes of determining whether
Seller\'s conditions to Closing set forth in Article VIII have been fulfilled;
provided, however, that any such notification, change, addition, amendment or
supplement by Seller to reflect any change in Law or to Schedule 2.1(d) (PB1
Tangible Personal Property), Schedule 2.1(e) (PB1 Inventory), Schedule 2.1(f)
(PB1 Contracts), but only to the extent permitted by Section 2.1(f), Schedule
2.5(d) (PB2 Tangible Personal Property), Schedule 2.5(e) (PB2 Inventory),
Schedule 2.5(f) (PB2 Contracts), but only to the extent permitted by Section
2.5(f), Schedule 2.9(d) (PB3 Tangible Personal Property), Schedule 2.9(e) (PB3

Schedule 2.17(f) (Common Facilities Contracts), but only to the extent
permitted by Section 2.17(f), Part I of Schedule 4.11 (Permits), Part I or II
of Schedule 4.13 (Intellectual Property) or Part I of Schedule 4.15(a)
(Project Environmental Matters) shall be deemed to have cured any breach or
inaccuracy of such representations and warranties for purposes of determining
whether such conditions to Closing have been fulfilled, other than each
Purchaser\'s condition to Closing set forth in Section 7.11. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.2, for a period of sixty (60) days
after the Effective Date, PB1 Purchaser shall have the right to add to

a party, or by which Seller or any of the Purchased Assets is bound, that
relates to or has the primary purpose of supporting the Project or the
Business, in each case, subject to the prior written consent of Seller (which
such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
provided, that in no event shall any of the foregoing Contracts made a
Purchased Contract pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above give rise to a Seller's
Required Consent or Purchaser's Required Consent (although, to the extent a
Consent is required to assign any such Contract to a Purchaser, Schedule 4.3
(Seller's Consents) will be deemed amended to include a reference to such
Consent). For the avoidance of doubt, no Contract listed on any Schedule as a
Purchased Contract as of the Effective Date shall be removed from such
Schedule or added to any Schedule as a PB1 Excluded Contract, PB2 Excluded
Contract, PB3 Excluded Contract, PB4 Excluded Contract or Common Facilities
Excluded Contract, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the immediately
preceding sentence. If the Closing occurs, all matters disclosed by any Party
pursuant to any such notification, change, addition, amendment or supplement
made prior to the Closing shall be deemed to be included in the Schedules as
of the Effective Date or applicable later date and to cure any breach or
inaccuracy of such representations and warranties for purposes of determining
whether any of the PB1 Purchaser Group, PB2 Purchaser Group, PB3 Purchaser
Group, PB4 Purchaser Group or Seller Group, as applicable, is entitled to
indemnification under Article IX.

(b)The Parties agree that whether particular property subject to the IDA Lease
Agreement is classified as real, mixed or personal property under applicable
Law, so long as (i) such property is described in a Schedule and (ii) good and
marketable fee simple absolute title of record to such property is conveyed to
the applicable Project Purchaser at the Closing from Seller, then
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, there
shall be no breach of any representation or warranty associated with something
being misclassified as real or personal property under this Agreement.

Section 11.3. Counterparts, Signatures, and Originals 

. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which is
an original, but all of which together constitute one and the same instrument.
The Parties agree that this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and any other
document issued pursuant to this Agreement, or document referenced by the
foregoing, will be considered signed when the signature of a party is
delivered by facsimile transmission. Such facsimile signature shall be treated
in all respects as having the same effect as an original signature. Any
original of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any other document
issued pursuant to this Agreement or document referenced by the foregoing may
be photocopied and stored on computer tapes and disks (the "Imaged Document").
The Imaged Document, if introduced in printed format in its original form in
any judicial, arbitral, mediation, regulatory, or administrative proceeding
will be admissible as between the Parties to the same extent and under the
same conditions as other business records originated and maintained in
documentary form. No Party shall object to the admissibility of the Imaged
Document (or photocopies of the Imaged Document) on the basis that such were
not originated or maintained in documentary form, under a hearsay rule, a best
evidence rule or other evidentiary rule.

Section 11.4. Severability

. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such manner as to be valid, binding and enforceable under Law, but if any
provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, void (or voidable) or
unenforceable under Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent held to be invalid, void (or voidable) or unenforceable, without
affecting the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this
Agreement. To the extent permitted by Law, the Parties waive any provision of
Law that renders any provision hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any
respect.

Section 11.5. Assignment

. The rights under this Agreement shall not be assignable or transferable, nor
the duties delegable, by any Party without the prior written consent of the
other Parties, which consent may be granted or withheld in each such other
Party\'s sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any Party may
upon prior written notice to the other Parties collaterally assign, mortgage,
hypothecate, pledge, or otherwise encumber all or any portion of its interest
in and to this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement to its and any of its
Affiliates\' lenders or other parties providing financing (including lease
financing) to such Party or any of its Affiliates and grant to such lenders or
financing parties the power to assign the same upon prior written notice to
the other Parties in connection with an exercise of such lenders\' or
financing parties\' remedies; provided, however, that neither the grant of any
such interest, nor the foreclosure of any such interest, shall, to the extent
any Party has retained any portion of its interest in and to this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements, in any way release, reduce or diminish the
obligations of such Party to the other Parties hereunder with respect to such
portion of such Party\'s interest and (ii) any Project Purchaser may, without
the consent of Seller, transfer or assign its rights, liabilities and interest
in and under this Agreement to an Affiliate of such Project Purchaser that is
or, after consummation of a proposed corporate reorganization or restructuring
(e.g., the potential business combination of EGSL and Entergy Louisiana, LLC
pending before the Louisiana Public Service Commission in Docket No. U-33244),
will be a regulated electric utility owned, directly or indirectly, by Entergy
Corporation. Any assignment effected in accordance with this Section 11.5
(other than clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence) shall not
relieve the assigning Party of its obligations and liabilities under this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party. Any purported
assignment or delegation not effected in accordance with this Section 11.5
shall be deemed void and of no force and effect.

Section 11.6. Governing Law

. The validity, interpretation and effect of this Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York
without regard to conflicts of law doctrines (other than Section 5-1401 of the
New York General Obligations Law), except with respect to matters that (a) are 

preempted by federal law or are governed by the Law of the respective
jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, as applicable, of the Parties, or
(b) relate to real property and are governed by the Law of the State of
Arkansas. Any action or proceeding arising under this Agreement shall be
adjudicated by courts of the State of Texas and the courts of the United
States located in the State of Texas, in each case located in Harris County,
State of Texas, and appellate courts from any thereof, AND EACH PARTY CONSENTS
AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE BROUGHT IN AND ONLY IN
SUCH COURTS AND WAIVES (TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW) ANY OBJECTION
THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR
PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING WAS BROUGHT IN
AN INCONVENIENT FORUM OR ANY SIMILAR OBJECTION AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR
CLAIM THE SAME.

Section 11.7. Waiver of Jury Trial

. EACH OF THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
LITIGATION, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT.

Section 11.8. Notices

. Unless this Agreement specifically requires otherwise, any notice, claim,
demand or request provided for in this Agreement, or served, given or made in

Section 11.9. No Third Party Beneficiaries

. Except as may be specifically set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement, whether express or implied, is intended to confer any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement on any Person (including any
Project Employee or any other present, former or future Employee of any member
of the Entegra Group or any of such members\' respective ERISA Affiliates)
other than the Parties, their respective permitted successors and assigns, and
any Person benefiting from the indemnities provided herein, nor is anything in
this Agreement intended to relieve or discharge the obligation or liability of
any third Persons to any Party, nor give any third Persons any right of
subrogation or action against any Party.

Section 11.10. No Joint Venture

. Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or is intended to create an
association, trust, partnership or joint venture or impose a trust or
partnership duty, obligation or liability on or with regard to any Party.

Section 11.11. Waiver of Compliance 

. To the extent permitted by Law, any failure to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition set forth herein or in any Ancillary
Agreement, or any breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein or
in any Ancillary Agreement, may be waived by the Party entitled to the benefit
of such obligation, covenant, agreement, condition, representation or warranty
only by a written instrument signed by or on behalf of such Party that
expressly waives such failure or breach, but any such waiver shall not operate
as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any prior or subsequent failure
to comply therewith or breach thereof. The waiver of any condition based on
the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, or the waiver of the fulfillment
of any such condition, shall not affect the right to indemnification or other
remedy based on such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation except
to the extent otherwise specifically provided herein. The failure of a Party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. A waiver by a Party of
the performance of any covenant, condition, representation or warranty of the
other Party shall not invalidate this Agreement, nor shall such waiver be
construed as a waiver of any other covenant, condition, representation or
warranty. A waiver by a Party of the time for performing any act shall not
constitute a waiver of the time for performing any other act or the time for
performing an identical act required to be performed at a later time.

Section 11.12. Nature of Entegra TC\'s Obligations

. From and after the Closing, in all instances where an obligation is imposed
upon Seller under this Agreement but no similar obligation is expressly
imposed upon Entegra TC, Entegra TC shall nevertheless be responsible for any
Losses arising from or related to Seller\'s breach of such obligation;
provided, however, that this obligation shall only survive until twenty-four
(24) consecutive months have lapsed since the Closing Date. This Section 11.12
shall in no way limit Seller\'s obligations under this Agreement.

Section 11.13. Attorneys\' Fees

. In any litigation or other proceeding between the Parties relating to this
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other
its reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such litigation
or proceeding, including reasonable attorneys\' fees and other legal expenses.

Section 11.14. Several Liability of Purchasers

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the liability of
the Purchasers is several and not joint with respect to all representations,
warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations of the Purchasers under
this Agreement.
