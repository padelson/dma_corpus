Consideration, payable in part at Closing and in part from the Escrow Funds,
as shall be allocated and distributed to such Company Share in accordance with
Paragraphs 12.5 and 12.6 of the Company Operating Agreement (where, for such

accordance with its terms at the Effective Time (each, an "Unvested Company
Option") shall as of the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without
any further action of the holder of such Unvested Company Option be converted
into an option for Parent stock in accordance with _Section 5.7(c)_. Parent

Consideration to which the holders of record of Vested Company Options shall
be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.6_ and _Section 1.7_ to the
Surviving Company for distribution to the Vested Company Option holders. The
payment of the Option Consideration to each holder of Vested Company Options
as described in this _Section 1.6(d)_ shall be reduced by the Surviving
Company (or its payroll agent) to the extent necessary to satisfy any income
Tax withholding or the employees share of any payroll Taxes required under
the Code or any provision of applicable Legal Requirements and such withheld
amounts and payroll Taxes shall be remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Entity in accordance with _Section 1.7(d)_. To the extent that amounts are
withheld pursuant to the preceding sentence or used to satisfy the employees
share of any payroll Taxes, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Vested Company
Option. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent on or prior to the Closing an
irrevocable written agreement, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit I_ or
otherwise in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent (an "Option
Cancellation Agreement"), from each holder of a Company Option providing
that, (i) as of the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option, by virtue of
the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder of such Vested Company Option, shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive, in lieu of the Company Shares
otherwise acquirable and receivable upon the exercise of such Vested Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, an aggregate amount in cash,
without interest and subject to applicable withholding as set forth in this
_Section 1.6(d)_, the Option Consideration, payable in part at Closing and in
part from the Escrow Funds, (ii) from and after the Effective Time, the
Vested Company Options, as converted in accordance with this _Section
1.6(d)_, shall solely represent the right to receive the Option Consideration
in accordance with this _Section 1.6(d)_ and  _Section 1.7(c)_, and shall
not be exercisable for the purchase of Company Shares or shares of stock of
Parent, and (iii) each Unvested Company Option shall as of the Effective Time
by virtue of the Merger and without any further action of the holder of such
Unvested Company Option be converted into an option for Parent stock in

calculating the net-exercise of Vested Company Options outstanding at the
Effective Time, and the iterative calculations related thereto set forth in
_Schedule 1.6(d)_ (such formula, the "Net Exercise Formula"), but subject to
adjustment for Company Options that vest or are exercised prior to the
Effective Time). For the avoidance of doubt, the Net Exercise Formula shall be
the method of calculating the net-exercise of Vested Company Options
outstanding at the Effective Time that shall be binding on the parties
hereto. For purposes of calculating the amount of cash to be paid to each
Company Member and each holder of Vested Company Options pursuant to this
_Section 1.6(e)_ respectively, all amounts payable to such member or
holder (without rounding) shall be aggregated and after such aggregation,
such amount shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent.

Fund and the Member Tax Distribution Fund contributed following the Effective
Time with respect to each Company Member and each holder of Vested Company
Options as of  



 

6  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be in proportion to the
aggregate amount of the Aggregate Member Consideration and Aggregate
Option Consideration, as the case may be, each such Company Member and holder
of a Vested Company Option, as applicable, would otherwise be entitled to
receive in the Merger by virtue of ownership of outstanding Company Shares and

require holders to certify as to their respective ownership of Company Shares
and in the case of Company Options shall require execution of an Option
Cancellation Agreement)), and (B) instructions for use in effecting such
transfer in exchange for cash constituting the applicable portion of the
Closing Merger Consideration. Upon transfer of Company Shares and Vested
Company Options to the Exchange Agent for cancellation, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of record of such Company
Shares or Vested Company Options shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash constituting the portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 1.6_ and
_Section 1.7_. At the election of the respective Company Member, the Exchange
Agent shall make the foregoing payment by wire transfer within two (2)
Business Days after provision of appropriate materials to the Exchange Agent,
to the extent that the aggregate amount owed to any such holder at the Closing
is in excess of U.S.$100,000; _provided_ that, if such appropriate materials
are provided to the Exchange Agent at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the opening of business on the Closing Date by any 1% holder of Company
Shares, the Exchange Agent shall make the foregoing payment to such holder on
the Closing Date; and _provided_ ,  _further_ that payment of any portion of
the Option Consideration shall upon receipt of the applicable letter of
transmittal be paid to the Surviving Company for disbursement to the
applicable holder of Vested Company Options, subject to withholding as
described in _Section 1.7(d)_. Until so transferred, outstanding Company
Shares or Vested Company Options, as applicable, will be deemed from and after
the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the ownership of
the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration into which such securities
shall have been so converted.

 (d) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent, the Escrow
Agent and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder or former holder of Company Shares or Vested Company Options
such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or  



 

7  under any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. Any withheld
amounts shall be promptly paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity. To
the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such
consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been
paid. The employers share of any payroll Taxes associated with distributions
to be made with respect to the holders of Vested Company Options out of the
Escrow Funds shall reduce on a pro rata basis the amount otherwise available
for distribution to the holders of the Company Shares and Vested Company
Options out of the Escrow Funds and shall be paid over to Parent in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement for payment over to the appropriate Governmental
Entity.

 (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this  _Section 1.7_, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company nor
any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares or Vested
Company Options for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided,
however, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to holders of the Companys securities pursuant to this _Article I_.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a
part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to
holders of the Companys securities pursuant to this _Article I_ shall
promptly be paid to Parent.

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares and Vested
Company Options twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, at the
request of the Surviving Company, be delivered to the Surviving Company or
otherwise according to the instruction of the Surviving Company, and any
holders of the Company Shares or Vested Company Options who have not
transferred such securities in compliance with this _Section 1.7_ shall after
such delivery to the Surviving Company look only to Parent and the Surviving
Company for the amount of cash constituting the portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ and _Section 1.6(d)_ with respect
to the Company Shares and/or Vested Company Options, as applicable, formerly
represented thereby. If any Company Shares or Vested Company Options shall
not have been transferred immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity, any such
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of the Companys
securities immediately prior to such time shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the Surviving Company
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

1.8 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares._ All cash paid
upon the transfer for exchange of Company Shares and Vested Company Options in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares and Vested
Company Options, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the records of the Surviving Company of Company Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company
Shares or Vested  



 

8  Company Options are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article I_.

 

1.9 _Further Action._ At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of Parent and the officers and members of the Board of Managers
of the Surviving Company will be deemed to have been granted an irrevocable
power of attorney to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
Company and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances
and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub,
any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Company any and all right, title and interest in,
to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Company as a result of, or in connection with, the
Merger.

(ii) there are Estimated Transaction Expenses, then the Aggregate Merger
Consideration payable at the Closing shall be decreased by such amount, and

Surplus"), then the Aggregate Merger Consideration payable at the Closing
shall be increased by the amount of such Estimated Surplus.

 (d) _Post-Closing Statement_. As promptly as practicable, but not
later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be

 (e) _Disputes_. If the Members Representative disagrees
with Parents calculation of Closing Cash, Closing Transaction Expenses
and/or Closing Date Net Working Capital as set forth in the Closing Statement,
the Members Representative may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Closing Statement, deliver a notice (the "Protest Notice") to Parent
disagreeing with such calculation of Closing Cash, Closing Transaction
Expenses and/or Closing Date Net Working Capital, as applicable, setting forth
the Members Representatives calculation of Closing Cash, Closing
Transaction Expenses and/or Closing Date Net Working Capital, as applicable,
and in reasonable detail the Members Representatives grounds for such
disagreement. The failure of the Members Representative to deliver such
Protest Notice within the prescribed time period will constitute the Members
Representatives acceptance of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement. If a Protest Notice shall be duly delivered pursuant to this
_Section 1.10(e)_, Parent and the Members Representative shall, during the
fifteen (15) days following such delivery, discuss in good faith and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement in writing on the disputed
items or amounts in order to determine the amount of Closing Cash, Closing
Transaction Expenses and/or Closing Date Net Working Capital, as applicable.
If, by the end of such period, Parent and the Members Representative are
unable to reach agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause a nationally
recognized firm of independent public accountants which does not provide
significant services to either Parent or the Company ("Accountants"), as
mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Members Representative, promptly to
review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
calculating the amount of Closing Cash, Closing Transaction Expenses and/or
Closing Date Net Working Capital, as applicable. In making such calculation,
such Accountants shall consider only those items or amounts in Closing Cash,
Closing Transaction Expenses and/or Closing Date Net Working Capital, as
applicable, as to which the Members Representative has disagreed.
Furthermore, in resolving any disputed item, the Accountants may not assign a
value to any particular item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the lowest value for such item claimed
by either party, in each case as presented to the Accountants. Such
Accountants shall deliver to Parent and the Members Representative, as
promptly as practicable, but in any case within forty-five (45) days after
acceptance of its appointment, a report setting forth such calculations. Such
report shall be final and binding upon Parent and the Members Representative.
The aggregate costs of any such review and report ("Accountants Costs")
arising out of disagreements over Closing Cash, Closing Transaction Expenses
and/or Closing Date Net Working Capital, as applicable, shall be borne by the
holders of Company Shares and Vested Company Options, on the one hand, and
Parent, on the other hand, based on the percentage that the amount not awarded
to Parent or the holders of Company Shares and Vested Company Options bears to
the amount actually contested by such party;  _provided_ that, any
Accountants Costs to be borne by the holders of Company Shares and Vested
Company Options pursuant to this _Section 1.10(e)_ shall be satisfied out of
the Adjustment Escrow Fund in accordance with the provisions of _Section
1.12_ and the Escrow Agreement. Parent and the Members Representative agree
that they will, and Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Company to, cooperate
and assist in any review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement by the Members Representative and its advisors referred to in this
_Section 1.10(e)_, including making available to the extent necessary books,
records, work papers and personnel. The date on which the Final Cash, Final
Transaction Expenses and the



 

12  Final Closing Date Net Working Capital is finally determined in accordance
with this _Section 1.10(e)_ is hereafter referred to as the "Determination
Date."

 (f) _Final Aggregate Merger Consideration Adjustment_. The
"Adjustment Amount" shall equal the sum of (i) Final Cash __minus__ the
Estimated Closing Cash, __plus__ (ii) the Estimated Transaction Expenses  _
_minus__ the Final Transaction Expenses, __plus__ (iii) the Final Closing Date
Net Working Capital __minus__ the Estimated Net Working Capital, each
component of and sum of which amounts may be positive or negative. If the
Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Aggregate Merger
Consideration shall be increased by the absolute value of the Adjustment
Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then the Aggregate
Merger Consideration shall be decreased by the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount.

 (i) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number or zero then,
promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days thereafter, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for
distribution in accordance with _Section 1.6(d)_ and _Section 1.7(c)_ the
Adjustment Amount, if any, as finally determined, __plus__ interest on the
Adjustment Amount from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the "Prime
Rate" of interest published in the "Money Rates" column of _The Wall Street
Journal_ (or the average of such rates if more than one rate is indicated) on
the Closing Date, and the Adjustment Escrow Fund (less any Accountants Costs
or DandO insurance costs to be borne by the holders of Company Shares and Vested
Company Options as described in _Section 1.12(a)_ and _(c)_ hereof) shall be
deposited (subject to, for the avoidance of doubt, any required withholding
under _Section 1.7(d)_) with the Exchange Agent for distribution to the
Company Members and holders of Vested Company Options in accordance with
_Section 1.6_ and  _Section 1.7_ hereof.

 (ii) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number and the amount
payable to Parent is _less_ _than_ the Adjustment Escrow Fund, then promptly
following the Determination Date, and in any event within five (5) Business
Days thereafter, an amount equal to the absolute value of the Adjustment
Amount, as finally determined, plus interest on the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the "Prime
Rate" of interest published in the "Money Rates" column of _The Wall Street
Journal_ (or the average of such rates if more than one rate is indicated) on
the Closing Date, shall be distributed from the Adjustment Escrow Fund to
Parent in accordance with _Section 1.12_ and the Escrow Agreement to pay
such Adjustment Amount, and the remainder of the Adjustment Escrow Fund (less
any Accountants Costs or DandO insurance costs to be borne by the holders of
Company Shares and Vested Company Options as described in  _Section 1.12(a)_
and _(c)_ hereof) shall be deposited (subject to, for the avoidance of doubt,
any required withholding under _Section 1.7(d)_ hereof) with the Exchange
Agent for distribution to the Company Members and holders of Vested Company
Options in accordance with _Section 1.6_ and _Section 1.7_ hereof. In the
event the amount in the remaining portion of the Adjustment Escrow Fund is
insufficient to satisfy any Accountants Costs and DandO insurance costs to be
borne by the holders of Company Shares and Vested Company Options as set forth
above, such payment obligations shall be paid out of the Indemnity Escrow
Fund.

 (iii) To the extent that the Adjustment Amount is a negative number
and the amount payable to Parent exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Fund, then
promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days thereafter, the full  



 

13  amount of the Adjustment Escrow Fund, __plus__ interest on the absolute
value of the Adjustment Amount from the Closing Date to the date of

of _The Wall Street Journal_ (or the average of such rates if more than one
rate is indicated) on the Closing Date, shall be distributed from
the Adjustment Escrow Fund to Parent by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
_Section 1.12_ and the Escrow Agreement, and the full amount of such
shortfall shall be paid to Parent from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance
with Parents instructions. Any Accountants Costs or DandO insurance costs to
be borne by the holders of Company Shares and Vested Company Options as
described in _Section 1.12(a)_ and _(c)_ hereof shall be paid out of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund.

any act of any Company Member or any holder of Company Options, Parent shall
transfer an amount of cash equal to the (a) Adjustment Escrow Amount __plus__

and the reduction in the amount of the Aggregate Option Consideration payable
to each holder of Vested Company Options pursuant to _Section 1.6(d)_, as

Representative Fund and the Member Tax Distribution Fund to be governed under
the terms set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction before which any
proceeding may be brought.

properties is bound or affected; or (iii) result in any breach of or

creation of a Lien on any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any Contract to which Parent or any of its

Subsidiaries business. There is no judgment, injunction, order or decree
binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which has or would reasonably
be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially impairing the
business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 3.5 _Litigation._ As of the date hereof, there are no material
claims, suits, actions, demand letters, judicial, administrative or regulatory
complaints, charges, proceedings or hearings, notices of violation or
investigations before any court, governmental department, commission, agency,

their respective properties, or any of their executive officers and directors
in connection with his or her status as a director or executive officer of
such entities that seeks to restrain or enjoin the consummation of

Effect on Parent.

commitment or provision by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is bound or affected as of the date hereof, which confidentiality obligation,
commitment or provision shall be disclosed to Parent, _provided_ , that,
disclosure of such obligation, commitment or provision would not itself be the
breach of an obligation or commitment to a third party or (B) result in a
waiver of any legal privilege enjoyed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. With respect to the exchange of competitively sensitive
information, including strategic and marketing plans, pricing material and
customer specific data, outside antitrust counsel will be consulted prior to

information.

 (c) _Notification_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will
notify the others promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any
officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made
pursuant hereto and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental
Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or
information provided to comply in all material respects with, any Legal
Requirements. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to _Section 5.5(a)_,
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform
the others of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable
Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.

 (d) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this  



 

54  Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to cause the
conditions precedent set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied; (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making
of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including
registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any)
and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit,
claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity; (iii)
the defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative (including actions by a private party)
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (iv) the execution or delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

5.6 _Third Party Consents._ Parent acknowledges that certain consents
and waivers with respect to the Merger may be required from parties to
Company Material Contracts and that in some instances such consents and
waivers may not have been obtained. Not later than two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a complete and accurate
list setting forth those consents and waivers described in the previous
sentence that have not been obtained by the Company as of such Time (the
"Unobtained Consents"). The Unobtained Consents shall in no event include any
matters related to the ECT Agreements and Euromax Agreement which are governed
by _Section 6.3(h)_. Parent agrees that the Company and its Affiliates shall
not have any liability whatsoever to Parent arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any Unobtained Consents or because of the termination of any
Company Material Contract as a result thereof. Parent further agrees that no
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained herein shall be
breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be deemed not satisfied,
as a result of (a) the failure to obtain any Unobtained Consents, (b) any such
termination or (c) any action commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any
Person arising out of or relating to the Unobtained Consents. Notwithstanding
the above, Parent shall retain any right it may have to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the provisions set forth in  _Section 6.3_ and
_Article VIII_ due to the Companys failure to obtain the Unobtained Consents.
Prior to the Closing, Parent shall cooperate with the Company, upon the
reasonable request of the Company, in any reasonable manner in connection
with the Company obtaining any such consents and waivers; _provided_ that,
such cooperation shall not include any requirement of Parent or any of its
Affiliates to expend money, commence, defend or participate in any litigation
or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third
Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the lessor or
licensor under any Lease listed on Section 2.15 of the Company Disclosure
Letter conditions its grant of a consent (including by threatening to
exercise a "recapture" or other termination right) upon, or otherwise requires
in response to a notice or consent request regarding this Agreement, the
payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration
(including increased rent payments), or the provision of additional security
(including a guaranty), Parent shall be solely responsible for making all such
payments or providing all such additional security.

5.7 _Employee Benefits_.

 (a) _Service Credit; Eligibility_. Following the Effective Time,
Parent shall arrange for each participant in the Company Benefit Plans who
becomes an employee of Parent,  



 

55  any Affiliate of Parent or the Surviving Company (the "Company
Participants") to be eligible for employee benefits that are no
less favorable, in the aggregate, as those received by employees of Parent
with substantially similar employment locations, positions and
responsibilities. Each Company Participant shall be given service credit for
all purposes for his or her length of service with the Company (and its
Subsidiaries and predecessors) prior to the Closing, including, without
limitation, for eligibility for participation and vesting under Parent
employee benefit plans and arrangements and vacation accrual; provided, that
no retroactive contributions or duplication of benefits will be required.
Parent shall cause any and all pre-existing condition (or actively at work or
similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any Parent employee benefit plans and arrangements to be
waived with respect to such Company Participants to the extent waived or
satisfied under the relevant Company Benefit Plan, and shall provide Company
Participants with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or
similar payments) made during the plan year which includes the Closing Date
for the purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or
similar requirements under any Parent employee benefit plans or arrangements
in which they are eligible to participate after the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that such credit shall only be required to the extent each Company Participant
submits documentation to Parent, which documentation is reasonably acceptable
to Parent, showing the amount of deductibles, co-payments and offsets which
must be taken into consideration for purposes of Parents relevant employee
benefit plans and arrangements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein nothing shall preclude the Surviving Company from terminating the
employment of any Employee for any reason for which the Company could have
terminated such Employee prior to the Effective Time.

 (b) _Parent ESPP_. Parent agrees that, from and after the Closing
Date, the Company employees who become employees of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries may participate in the employee stock purchase plan sponsored by
Parent (the "Parent ESPP"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Parent
ESPP, and that service with the Company shall be treated as service with
Parent or its subsidiaries for determining eligibility of the Companys
employees under the Parent ESPP.

 (c) _Assumption of Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each
Unvested Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, regardless of the respective exercise prices thereof, will be assumed
by Parent. Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth
in the applicable Company Option (including any applicable stock option
agreement or other document evidencing such Company Option) in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or
vesting provisions), except that (i) each Unvested Company Option will be
exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that
number of whole shares of common stock of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") equal
to the product of the number of Company Class E Shares that were issuable
upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
__multiplied by__ the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price
for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed
Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by __dividing__ the
exercise price per Company Class E Share at which such Company Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange
Ratio,  



 

56  rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each Company Option assumed pursuant
to this _Section 5.7_ will be adjusted in a manner consistent with Section
424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder whether or not such
Company Option is an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section
422 of the Code. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time, Parent will issue to each Person who holds an assumed Company Option a
document evidencing the assumption of such Company Option by Parent as
described in this _Section 5.7(c)_. In addition, Parent shall take such
actions as are reasonably necessary for the assumption and conversion of the
Unvested Company Options pursuant to this Agreement, including the reservation
for issuance and authorization for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market
of the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the new Parent options into
which the Unvested Company Options have been converted. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without the need of any further corporate action,
Parent shall assume the Company Option Plan, with the result that all
obligations of the Company under the Company Option Plan, including with
respect to the Unvested Company Options outstanding at the Effective Time,
shall be obligations of Parent following the Effective Time. Parent shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable with respect to the new Parent options eligible for
registration on such form as soon as reasonably practicable (and no later than
ten (10) Business Days) after the Effective Time and shall exercise
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement for so long as any of such new Parent options remains outstanding.
As used herein, "Option Exchange Ratio" shall mean the quotient obtained by
__dividing__ (x) the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration allocable
to each outstanding Company Class E Share by (y) the average closing sale
price of one share of Parent Common Stock for the twenty (20) most recent
trading days that Parent Common Stock has traded ending on the trading day
which is two (2) trading days prior to the Effective Time, as reported on the
Nasdaq Global Select Market. 

5.8 _Indemnification_.

 (a) For the period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the Surviving
Company shall remain obligated to perform the indemnification obligations of
the Company under Article XI of the Company Operating Agreement with respect
to all persons who were members of the Board of Managers of the Company prior
to the Effective Time (the "Company Indemnified Parties"). For a period of six
(6) years following the Effective Time, the Limited Liability Company
Agreement (or successor document(s)) of the Surviving Company will contain
provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least
as favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties as those contained in the
Company Operating Agreement as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Company Indemnified Parties.

 (b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company will fulfill and honor in all respects its obligations
pursuant to the indemnification agreements listed in Section 2.18(a)(x) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, subject to applicable Legal Requirements.

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have acquired (with
premiums and costs to be borne equally by (a) the holders of Company Shares
and Vested  



 

57  Company Options, on the one hand, and (b) Parent, on the other hand, "tail"
coverage with respect to director and officer liability insurance coverage
for the individuals who were officers and directors of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to Closing, such coverage to extend six (6)
years from the Closing Date. Any such premiums and costs to be borne by
the holders of Company Shares and Vested Company Options pursuant to this
_Section 5.8(c)_ shall be satisfied out of the Adjustment Escrow Fund in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.12_ and the Escrow Agreement.

 

 (d) The indemnification provisions and obligations of this _Section
5.8_ shall not apply as to any Company Indemnified Party to any Losses to
which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from any Company
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 7.3_.

 (e) This _Section 5.8_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by the Company Indemnified Parties and their heirs and
personal representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving Company and its
successors and assigns and shall be in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by contract or otherwise. In the event the Surviving Company or its
successor or assign (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving
Company, as the case may be, honor the obligations set forth with respect to
Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, in this _Section 5.8_.

5.9 _Merger Sub Compliance._ Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply
with all of Merger Subs obligations under or relating to this Agreement.
Merger Sub shall not engage in any business which is not in connection with
the Merger.

5.10 _Tax Matters_.

 (a) _Transfer Taxes._ Parent, on the one hand, and the holders of
Company Shares and Vested Company Options, on the other hand, shall be equally
responsible for and shall pay when due any stamp duty, transfer or other
similar taxes or governmental fees (including any interest or penalties
related thereto) that may be payable in connection with Parents acquisition
of the Company Shares from the Company Members (the "Transfer Taxes"). Any
such Transfer Taxes to be borne by the holders of Company Shares and Vested
Company Options pursuant to this _Section 5.10(a)_ shall be satisfied out of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the provisions of _Section
7.3(a)_ and the Escrow Agreement. The party required by applicable Legal
Requirements to file a Tax Return with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall do
so within the time period prescribed by such Legal Requirements, and Parent
shall promptly reimburse the holders of Company Shares for any Transfer Taxes
so paid by such holders upon receipt of notice that such Transfer Taxes have
been paid.

 (b) _Liability for Taxes_. Any Income Tax and any Non-Income Tax
(other than any Non-Income Tax payable with respect to the portion of the
Pre-Closing Tax Period starting after the date of the Company Balance Sheet
and incurred in the ordinary course of business which shall in no event
include any transaction contemplated by this Agreement)  



 

58  payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (collectively, "Pre-Closing Taxes") shall be paid out of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund. Taxes with respect to the income, property or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries that relate to a taxable year or
other taxable period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date
(the "Straddle Period") will be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period as follows: (i) in the case of Taxes
other than Income Taxes and sales and use taxes, on a per diem basis and (ii)
in the case of Income Taxes and sales and use taxes, on a closing-of-the-books
basis as of the end of Closing Date. Parent and the holders of Company Shares
hereby agree that, for all tax purposes, the deduction resulting from the
payment of the portion of the Closing Merger Consideration attributed to the
Aggregate Option Consideration payable as of the Closing Date and the
attendant payroll Tax liability shall be properly allocable to, and deductible
by, the Company Members who held Company Class A Shares, Company Class B
Shares and Company Class C shares immediately prior to the Closing. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Post-Closing Tax Period" means any Tax period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, "Pre-Closing Tax Period"
means any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing
Date, "Income Tax" means any federal, state, local or foreign Tax which is
imposed or determined with reference to (A) gross or net income or profits
(including, but not limited to, capital gains, gross receipts or minimum tax),
or (B) multiple bases, including corporate franchise, gross receipts, net
worth, privilege, doing business or occupation taxes, if one of the bases is
listed in clause (A), and "Non-Income Tax" means any Tax other than an Income
Tax.

 (c) _Filing of Returns_. The Members Representative shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and file at its expense, all Income Tax and other
similar Tax Returns for the Company for which the items of income, deductions,
credits, gains or losses are passed through to the holders of Company Shares
under Section 702 of the Code (or any comparable provision of state or local
law) for a Pre-Closing Tax Period ("Pass-Through Returns"). All Pass-Through
Returns shall be prepared in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements
and, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Legal Requirements, the
past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries in filing their Pass-
Through Returns. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed all Returns that are not Pass-Through Returns of the Company
for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods ("Other Returns").

 (d) _Tax Controversies_. 

 (i) _Control Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, with respect to any examination, audit, contest, appeal or other
proceeding relating to Income Taxes of the Company attributable to Pre-Closing
Tax Periods, the Members Representative shall control at its expense
the contest and settlement of any such proceeding. The Members
Representative shall provide Parent with notice of any such examination,
audit, contest, appeal or other proceeding, shall provide Parent will any
relevant information relating to such proceeding, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in any such proceeding at its own expense if the outcome
of such proceeding could have an adverse effect on Parent or its Affiliates
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and its Subsidiaries) in
which case, the Members Representative shall not settle any portion of such
proceeding having such an adverse effect on Parent without the consent of the
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Parent shall cooperate with the Members  



 

59  Representative and shall provide the Members Representative with access to
Tax Returns, books and records and other relevant information and
shall execute any necessary powers of attorney relevant to the Members
Representatives authority hereunder. With respect to any examination, audit,
contest, appeal or other proceeding relating to Taxes of the Company other
than Income Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, Parent shall
control such contest and settlement and the Members Representative shall (
_provided_ that there are funds available in the Indemnity Escrow Fund to
cover all or a portion of any Taxes resulting from such settlement) have the
right to participate in such contest and settlement at its own expense, and (
_provided_ that there are funds available in the Indemnity Escrow Fund to any
Taxes resulting from such settlement) Parent shall not settle any such
proceeding without the consent of the Members Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 (ii) _Assistance and Cooperation_. The Members Representative and
Parent shall cooperate (and cause their Affiliates to cooperate) with each
other and with each others agents, including accounting firms and legal
counsel, in connection with Tax matters relating to the Company, including (A)
preparation and filing of Tax Returns, (B) determining the liability and
amount of any Taxes due or the right to and amount of any refund of Taxes, (C)
examinations of Tax Returns, and (D) any administrative or judicial proceeding
in respect of Taxes assessed or proposed to be assessed. Such cooperation
shall include each party making, as reasonably requested and available, all
information and documents in its possession relating to the Company, including
any necessary personnel, available to the other party. The parties shall
retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, and all material records
and other documents relating thereto, until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (including, to the extent notified by any party, any
extension thereof) of the Tax period to which such Tax Returns and other
documents and information relate. Each of the parties shall also make
available to the other party, as reasonably requested and available, personnel
(including officers, directors, employees and agents) responsible for
preparing, maintaining, and interpreting information and documents relevant to
Taxes, and personnel reasonably required as witnesses or for purposes of
providing information or documents in connection with any administrative
or judicial proceedings relating to Taxes.

 (e) _Disputes_. In the event of a dispute between Parent and the
Members Representative regarding the conduct or resolution of any audit,
claim, dispute or controversy relating to Taxes or the Allocation, such
dispute shall be referred to a nationally recognized accounting or law firm
mutually acceptable to Parent and the Members Representative (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the "Tax
Arbitrator"). The decision of the Tax Arbitrator shall be final and binding,
and its fees and costs shall be shared equally by Parent, on the one hand, and
the holders of Company Shares in accordance with their Pro Rata Portion, on
the other hand. Except as provided in the previous sentence, each party shall
bear its own costs for participating in such dispute resolution.

 (f) _Allocation to "Hot Assets_." Within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Parent shall provide to the Members Representative a statement
of the amount of the Aggregate Merger Consideration it is planning to
allocate to the assets of the Company described in Section 751(a)(1) or (2) of
the Code (the "Allocation") for the review and consent of the
Members Representative. The Allocation shall be based on applicable Legal
Requirements and the Closing Balance Sheet. Parent shall consider and
implement any adjustments to such  



 

60  Allocation as may be proposed by the Members Representative. If Parent and
the Members Representative are unable to agree to an Allocation
within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, such dispute shall be
referred to the Tax Arbitrator in accordance with _Section 5.10(e)_ hereto.
The sole permissible basis for such dispute shall be to determine whether the
Allocation was prepared in accordance with this _Section 5.10(f)_. The
parties agree to file all Tax Returns in accordance with the Allocation (as
finally determined under this _Section 5.10(f)_) and not to take any position
inconsistent therewith.

 (g) _Tax Consequences_. The parties agree that, for all U.S. federal
and applicable state income tax purposes, Parents acquisition of the Company
shall be treated by the Company Members as the sale of partnership interests
and by Parent as a purchase of partnership assets, in a manner consistent
with Revenue Ruling 99-6, and the parties shall report Parents acquisition of
the Company in a manner consistent with the foregoing.

5.11 _Company Members Consent; Information Statements_.

 (a) As promptly as practicable, but not later than five (5) Business
Days, after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly take all
action necessary in accordance with Delaware Law and the Company Operating
Agreement, to solicit the consent for Members Approval from Company Members
other than the Principal Members (the "Solicitation"). The Board shall issue
as part of the Solicitation the Board Recommendation, which recommendation
shall not be withdrawn, amended or modified in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub.

 (b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consents sought in the Solicitation as soon as practicable.

 (c) In connection with the Merger and the Solicitation, the Company
shall prepare and deliver to each Company Member (other than the Principal
Members), as part of the Solicitation, within five (5) Business Days after the
date hereof, an information statement relating to the Solicitation (the
"Member Information Statement"), providing (i) an accurate summary of all
material terms of this Agreement, the other agreements listed as exhibits
hereto or otherwise referenced herein and the Merger, (ii) for the
solicitation of a consent from the Company Members authorizing and approving
(x) the matters set forth above in _Section 5.11(a)_, and (y) the Members
Representative to act in its capacity as contemplated by this Agreement and
the other agreements listed as exhibits hereto or otherwise referenced
herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will provide Parent with an
initial draft of the Member Information Statement on or prior to the date
hereof and will consult with Parent on any subsequent drafts of such Member
Information Statement, granting Parent a reasonable opportunity to comment
thereon.

 (d) In connection with the Merger, the Company shall prepare and
deliver to each holder of Company Options, within five (5) Business Days after
the date hereof, an information statement (the "Option Holder Information
Statement") providing (i) an accurate summary of all material terms of this
Agreement and the Merger, and (ii) a copy of the Option Cancellation
Agreement. The Company will provide Parent with an initial draft of the
Option Holder Information Statement on or prior to the date hereof and will
consult with Parent on any  



 

61  subsequent drafts of such Option Holder Information Statement, granting
Parent a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.

5.12 _Post-Closing Tax Elections._ Parent hereby agrees that none of
Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary (or any affiliate or successor thereof)
shall make an election for federal or state income tax purposes with any
Governmental Entity following the Closing that could result in additional
United States federal or state Income Tax liability to one or more of the
Company Members (a "Prohibited Election"), including, without limitation, an
election under Section 338 of the Code. Notwithstanding anything else in this
agreement to the contrary, Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company Members from any additional United States federal or state Income Tax
liability incurred by such Company Members as a result of a Prohibited
Election.

5.13 _Notice from Customers._ After the date hereof through the
Closing Date, the Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent in the
event any of the Top Ten Customers provides any notice (written or oral) that
it (a) intends to cancel or otherwise materially and adversely modify its
relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary thereof on account of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, or (b) is Threatened
with bankruptcy or insolvency.

5.14 _Euromax Agreement and ECT Agreements._ In the event any party to
any portion of the Euromax Agreement proposes to modify the terms of Addendum
II or the Euromax Software License from the forms thereof attached hereto as
_Exhibit 5.14_ , the Company shall promptly notify Parent. Following the
Effective Time, Parent shall, if rendered necessary by Euromaxs termination
of the Euromax Agreement, cause the Surviving Company to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to perform the Phase II/III Obligations of Navis and its
Affiliates under the ECT Agreements in a manner that does not materially
deviate from the overall past performance of Navis during the twenty-four
(24) month period immediately preceding the date hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be in breach of the foregoing to the extent
any material deviation results from any amendment of the ECT Agreements, or
act or omission of Parent or the Surviving Company, that (a) is, in the
reasonable discretion of Parent or the Surviving Company (as applicable)
effected to remedy a breach by Navis or any Affiliate thereof of any portion
of the ECT Agreements or otherwise to prevent or mitigate any Losses or
reasonably anticipated Losses, or (b) is the result of any variation order,
enhancement request, work order, plan of approach, agreement for maintenance
or support services, or similar Contract entered into in the ordinary course
of business in a manner reasonably consistent with Navis past practices.

5.15 _Notification of Certain Matters._ The Company shall give prompt
written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt written notice to the
Company, of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event that would be
reasonably likely to result in a failure to satisfy the closing conditions set
forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_, as it relates to Parent, or 
_Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_, as it relates to the Company. In
addition, the Company shall give written notice of any matter heretofore
existing or hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known at the
date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described
in the Company Disclosure Letter, including, but not limited to, any
developments after the date hereof relating to any potential or existing
dispute or litigation matter disclosed in the Company  



 

62  Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that Section 2.9(o)(iii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall only be required to be updated once and shall
be updated within no more than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, notification
pursuant to this _Section 5.15 _shall not be deemed to cure any breach
of any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder or any breach
of the covenants of the Company hereunder.

5.16 _Option Cancellation Agreement Update_. No later than five
business days after the date hereof the Company will deliver an Option
Cancellation Agreement to every holder of a Company Option with a request
that the Option Cancellation Agreement is promptly executed and returned to
the Company, and will use its reasonable best efforts to assure that such
holders have received such materials and execute and return the
Option Cancellation Agreement prior to the Closing. The Company will deliver
to Parent on a regular basis (and, in any event, upon Parents reasonable
request) a written status report regarding the receipt by each Company Option
holder of the Option Cancellation Agreement and return to the Company of the
executed Option Cancellation Agreement by each Company Option holder, and
whether any Company Option holder has advised the Company of a refusal to
execute or any dispute or disagreement regarding the Option Cancellation
Agreement.

5.17 _Certain Matters_. Not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing, the Company shall provide Parent with the specific details,
including copies of the underlying documents, of the actions described in
_Exhibit 5.17_ and certain other matters related thereto.

5.18 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to
the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to
give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
Parents or its Subsidiaries operations. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries respective operations.

5.19 Board Rescission and Ratification. The Board of Managers of the
Company shall, subject to the approval of Parent which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, take the appropriate actions at its next scheduled

September 21, 2007 meeting providing for the termination of the Company
Option Plan, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

5.20 Employment Agreements. The Company shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, modify or terminate any of the Employment

claims to be compensated from the ECT Escrow Fund. For purposes hereof, "ECT
Escrow Determination Date" shall mean the date upon the earlier to occur of
(i) fifteen (15) days following the occurrence of all of (A) first commercial
lift at the Euromax Terminal (as defined in the Euromax Agreement) using
Release 4 (as defined in the Euromax Agreement) of the Euromax Terminal
Software (as defined in the Euromax Agreement), (B) First Go-Live (as defined
in the Euromax Agreement) and (C) the issuance by Euromax of the Acceptance
Certificate (as defined in the Agreement for the Supply of a Terminal
Management System) for Release 4, and (ii) the earlier of (A) the satisfaction
of the Phase II/III Obligations and (B) January 1, 2010.

 (c) _Disputes_. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of such ECT
Loss Statement, the Members Representative may deliver written notice (the
"ECT Protest Notice") to Parent of any objections, and the basis therefor,
which the Members Representative may have to the ECT Loss Statement. The
failure of the Members Representative to deliver such Protest Notice within
the prescribed time period will constitute the Members Representatives
acceptance of the ECT Loss Statement. If an ECT Protest Notice shall be duly
delivered pursuant to this _Section 7.8(c)_, Parent and the Members
Representative shall, during the fifteen (15) days following such delivery,
discuss in good faith and use their commercially reasonable efforts to
reach agreement in writing on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine the ECT Direct Loss Amount. If, by the end of such period, Parent
and the Members Representative are unable to reach agreement, they shall
promptly thereafter cause Accountants to promptly review this Agreement, the
ECT Loss Statement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
calculating the ECT Direct Loss Amount. In making such calculation, such
Accountants shall consider only those items or amounts as to which the
Members Representative has disagreed. Furthermore, in resolving any disputed
item, the Accountants may not assign a value to any particular item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than
the lowest value for such item claimed by either party, in each case as
presented to the Accountants. Such Accountants shall deliver to Parent and the
Members Representative, as promptly as practicable, but in any case
within forty-five (45) days after acceptance of its appointment, a report
setting forth such calculations. Such report shall be final and binding upon
Parent and the Members Representative. The Accountants Costs arising out
of disagreements over ECT Direct Losses, shall be borne by the holders of
Company Shares and Vested Company Options, on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand, based on the percentage that the amount not awarded to Parent or
the holders of Company Shares and Vested Company Options bears to the amount
actually contested by such party; provided that, any Accountants Costs to be
borne by the holders of Company Shares and Vested Company Options pursuant to
this _Section 7.8(c)_ shall be satisfied out of the ECT Escrow Fund in
accordance with  



 

74  the provisions of _Section 7.8(a)_. Parent and the Members Representative
agree that they will, and Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Company to,
cooperate and assist in any review of the ECT Loss Statement by the Members
Representative and its advisors referred to in this _Section 7.8(c)_,
including making available to the extent necessary books, records,
work papers and personnel. The date on which such ECT Direct Loss Amount is
finally determined in accordance with this _Section 7.8(c)_ is hereafter
referred to as the "ECT Direct Loss Determination Date."

 (d) _Payment_. If upon the ECT Direct Loss Determination Date, it
is determined that the Company Members and holders of Vested Company Options
owe Parent for ECT Direct Losses, then, promptly following the ECT Direct Loss
Determination Date, and in any event within five (5) Business Days
thereafter, an amount equal to the absolute value of the ECT Direct Loss
Amount, as finally determined, shall be distributed from the ECT Escrow Fund
to Parent in accordance with this _Section 7.8_ and the Escrow Agreement to
pay such ECT Direct Loss Amount, and the remainder, if any, of the ECT Escrow
Fund ( _ _less__ any Accountants Costs to be borne by the holders of Company
Shares and Vested Company Options as described in _Section 7.8(b)_ hereof)
shall be deposited (subject to, for the avoidance of doubt, any required
withholding under _Section 1.7(d)_) with the Exchange Agent for distribution
to the Company Members and, on behalf of the holders of Vested Company
Options, to the Surviving Company in accordance with _Section 1.6_ and
_Section 1.7_. Deliveries from the ECT Escrow Fund to the Company Members
and, on behalf of the former holders of Vested Company Options, to the
Surviving Company, as applicable, pursuant to this  _Section 7.8_ and the
Escrow Agreement, shall be made in proportion to their respective Pro Rata
Portion of the remaining ECT Escrow Fund, with each amount rounded to the
nearest whole cent (U.S.$0.01).

7.9 _Members  Representative_.

 (a) By virtue of the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the
requisite vote of the Company Members, each of the Company Members and
holders of Vested Company Options shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint
Navis Corporation as its agent and attorney-in-fact (the "Members
Representative") for and on behalf of the Company Members and holders of
Vested Company Options to give and receive notices and communications, to
authorize payment to (i) Parent from the Adjustment Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of any payment obligations of the Company Members and holders of
Vested Company Options pursuant to _Section 1.10_ for any negative Adjustment
Amount, and (ii) any Indemnified Party from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of claims by any Indemnified Party, to object to such payments,
to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified
Party against any Company Member or holders of Vested Company Options or by
any such Company Member or holders of Vested Company Options against any
Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such
Company Member or holders of Vested Company Options, in each case relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other
actions that are either (A) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Members Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (B)
specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement
(including, specifically, _Section 1.10 _  



 

75  hereof) or the Escrow Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the Company
Members with the right to a majority of the Pro Rata Portions of the Escrow
Funds from time to time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Members
Representative may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds (2/3)
interest of the Escrow Funds agree to such removal and to the identity of the
substituted agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Members Representative
may resign at any time by providing written notice of intent to resign to the
Company Members, which resignation shall be effective upon the earlier of (A)
thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of such written notice or (B)
the appointment of a successor by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Escrow Funds. No bond shall be required of the Members Representative, and
the Members Representative shall not receive any compensation for its
services. The Members Representative hereby designates each of Jonathan
Shields and Erik Tiemroth as the Members Representatives duly
authorized representatives to act on behalf of the Members Representative
with respect to all actions to be taken by the Members Representative
herewith. Each Company Member and the Members Representative hereby
collectively agree that Jonathan Shields and Erik Tiemroth have the authority
to act on behalf of the Members Representative, and Parent shall be entitled
to rely on the full power and authority of (A) Jonathan Shields and Erik
Tiemroth to act hereunder on behalf of the Members Representative, and (B)
the Members Representative to act hereunder on behalf of the Company Members.

 (b) The Members Representative represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as of the date hereof and as of the Effective Time the following:
(i) the Members Representative has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and the other agreements listed as
exhibits hereto executed in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, and to consummate the transactions contemplated for its consummation
hereby and thereby, (ii) the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any
other agreements executed in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, has been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the
Members Representative, (iii) this Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Members Representative and, assuming due execution and
delivery by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Members Representative, enforceable against the
Members Representative in accordance with its terms, except (A) as
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other Legal Requirements affecting the rights
of creditors generally and general equitable principles (whether considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law), and (B) as the remedy of
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may
be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of a court of competent
jurisdiction before which any proceeding may be brought.

 (c) The Members Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Members Representative while acting in good faith and
in the exercise of reasonable judgment, even if such act or omission
constitutes negligence on the part of such Members Representative. The
Members Representative shall only have the duties expressly stated in this
Agreement and shall have no other duty, express or implied. The Members
Representative may engage attorneys, accountants and other professionals and
experts. The Members Representative may in good faith rely conclusively upon
information, reports, statements and opinions prepared or presented by such
professionals, and any action taken by the Members Representative based on
such reliance shall be deemed conclusively to have been taken in good faith
and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Company Members shall  



 

76  indemnify the Members Representative and hold the Members Representative
harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred on the part of the
Members Representative (so long as the Members Representative was acting in
good faith in connection therewith) and arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of the Members Representatives duties
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel,
accountant, consultant or other service provider retained by the Members
Representative (the "Members Representative Expenses"). The Members
Representative Expenses shall be reimbursed (i) in the first instance, from
the Members Representative Fund and (ii) following such time as no funds
remain in the Members Representative Fund, from the Indemnity Escrow Fund. A
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Members Representative,
including (i) any notice of disagreement or any written resolution of any such
disagreement given in accordance with _Section 1.10_ and (ii) an amendment,
extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 8.4_ or _8.5_
hereof, shall constitute a decision of the Company Members and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon the Company Members.

 

 (d) There shall be a "Members Representative Amount" equal
to U.S.$150,000 of the Aggregate Merger Consideration (that concurrently with
the Effective Time and without any act of any Company Member or holder of
Company Options, Parent shall deposit in the Members Representative Fund),
which shall be withheld, as provided for in _Section 1.7(b)_ hereof, from
the payments made to, and will be available for possible payment from time to
time as further contemplated by this _Article VII_ to, the Company Members and
holders of Vested Company Options, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement. At the Closing, the portion of the Members Representative
Amount potentially payable to each Company Member and holder of Vested Company
Options shall be calculated and recorded.

 (e) The deposit of the Members Representative Amount (together with
interest and other income thereon) shall constitute the Members
Representative fund (the "Members Representative Fund"), which shall be
available to reimburse the Members Representative for the Members
Representative Expenses from time to time as they are reasonably incurred.
Until the end of the Members Representative Period and the resolution of all
pending claims related thereto, the Members Representative shall have the
right to recover Members Representative Expenses from the Members
Representative Fund prior to any distribution of the Members Representative
Amount to the Company Members and/or holders of Vested Company Options, and
from time to time as Members Representative Expenses are reasonably
incurred, the Members Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a
certificate setting forth the Members Representative Expenses actually
incurred.

 (f) The Members Representative Fund shall terminate promptly following
the reimbursement of any Members Representative Expenses associated with the
final resolution of any claims and/or disputes with respect to the Escrow
Funds after the end of the later of (i) the Second Indemnity Escrow Release
Date or (ii) the ECT Direct Loss Determination Date (the "Members
Representative Period"). Upon the termination of the Members Representative
Period, the remaining amount of cash in the Members Representative
Fund (together with interest and other income thereon) shall be deposited
with the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Company Members and holders of
Vested Company Options in accordance with _Section 1.6_ and _Section 1.7_
hereof. Deliveries from the Members Representative Fund to  



 

77  the Company Members and/or holders of Vested Company Options, as applicable,
pursuant to this _Section 7.9(f)_ and the Escrow Agreement shall be made in
proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portion of the remaining Members
Representative Fund, with each amount rounded to the nearest whole cent
(U.S.$0.01).

7.10 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event that an Indemnified Party
becomes aware of a third party claim (a "Third Party Claim") that
the Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result in a demand against the
Escrow Funds or for other indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_ ,
Parent shall within ten (10) Business Days after learning of such claim notify
the Members Representative of such claim. The Members Representative may,
at his, her or its election, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party (the
"Defense Notice") within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt from the
Indemnified Party of notice of such claim, which notice by the Members
Representative shall specify the counsel it will appoint to defend such claim
("Defense Counsel"), undertake and conduct at its expense the defense of such
Third Party Claim (other than a claim involving Taxes which shall be governed
exclusively be _Section 5.10_); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to approve the Defense Counsel, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event that the Members
Representative does deliver a Defense Notice and thereby elects to conduct the
defense of the subject claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with and
make available to the Members Representative such assistance and materials as
it may reasonably request and Parent shall be entitled to participate in, but
not to determine or conduct, the defense assisted by counsel of its own
choosing of such Third Party Claim. In such an event, the Members
Representative will not settle the subject claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If the Members Representative does not so elect to
undertake and conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim or fails to give
the notice within the fifteen (15) Business Day period, Parent shall have the
right to undertake the defense of and use reasonable efforts to defend such
claim and shall consult with the Members Representative regarding the
strategy for defense of such claim, including with respect to Parents choice
of legal counsel; _provided_ , _however_ , if Parent desires to settle any
such claim it will give the Members Representative written notice, and if
Members Representative objects in writing within five (5) Business Days of
receiving Parents notice, Members Representative can assume the further
defense of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , as a condition precedent to
the Members Representatives right to assume control of such defense, it must
first: (a) enter into an agreement with the Indemnified Party (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) pursuant to which
the Company Members agree to be fully responsible for all Losses relating to
such claim and unconditionally guarantees the payment and performance of any
liability or obligation which may arise with respect to such claim or the
facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification, and (b) furnish the
Indemnified Party reasonable security that the Company Members will
satisfy any such liability. Without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party which may be withheld for any reason or no reason, the
Members Representative will not enter into any settlement of any Third Party
Claim or cease to defend against such claim, if pursuant to or as a result of
such settlement or cessation, (i) injunctive relief or specific performance
would be imposed against the Indemnified Party, or (ii) such settlement or
cessation would lead to liability or create any financial or other obligation
on the part of the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 7.10_, the Members Representative shall
not be entitled to control, but may participate in,  



 

78  and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the
defense or settlement of any claim (A) that seeks a temporary
restraining order, a preliminary or permanent injunction or specific
performance against the Indemnified Party, (B) that involves criminal
allegations against the Indemnified Party, (C) that if unsuccessful, would set
a precedent that would materially interfere with, or have a material adverse
effect on, the business or financial condition of the Indemnified Party, or
(D) that may impose any amount of liability on the part of the Indemnified
Party for which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification
hereunder. In such an event, the Members Representative will still have all
of its obligations hereunder _provided_ that the Indemnified Party will not
settle the subject claim without the prior written consent of the Members
Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Any final
judgment entered or settlement agreed upon in the manner _provided_ herein
shall be binding upon the Members Representative and the Indemnified Party,
and shall conclusively be deemed to be an obligation with respect to which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to prompt indemnification hereunder. A failure
by an Indemnified Party to give timely or complete notice as provided in this
_Section 7.10_ will not affect the rights or obligations of any party
hereunder except and only to the extent that, as a result of such failure, any
party entitled to receive such notice was deprived of its right to recover
any payment under its applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise damaged
as a result of such failure to give timely notice.

7.11 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. PARENT AND MERGER SUB
EACH ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING IN _ARTICLE II_ HEREOF, AGREEMENTS BEING DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREOF AND THE COMPANY DISCLOSURE LETTER, THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, BY THE COMPANY OR ANY OTHER PERSON
FOR ANY PURPOSE UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING (I) WITH RESPECT TO THE
COMPANY, ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
OR (II) AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE
COMPANY FURNISHED OR MADE AVAILABLE TO PARENT, MERGER SUB AND
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING,
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AGREEMENTS BEING DELIVERED IN
CONNECTION HEREOF AND THE COMPANY DISCLOSURE LETTER, THERE ARE NO EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

breach of this Agreement;

 (c) by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity shall have

 (e) by Parent, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in either
case such that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.3(a_) or _Section
6.3(b)_ would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time

satisfied).

8.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any termination of
this Agreement under _Section 8.1_ will be effective immediately upon
the delivery of a valid written notice of the terminating party to the other

Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination
of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement

Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto (and, with respect to

acts of the other parties hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any

9.2 _Interpretation; Knowledge; Definitions_.

 (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to paragraph,
subparagraph, Section, subsection, clause, subclause, Article, Recital,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to a paragraph, subparagraph,
Section, subsection, clause, subclause, Article, Recital, Exhibit or Schedule
to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. For purposes of this Agreement,
the words "include," "includes" and "including," when used herein, shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation."
The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. When reference is made herein to "the
business of" an entity, such reference shall be deemed to include the
business of all such entity and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. An
exception or disclosure made in Company Disclosure Letter with regard to a
representation of the Company shall be deemed made with respect to any other
representation by such party to which such exception or disclosure is
reasonably apparent on its face if such information would reasonably be
interpreted as having application to such other
representation notwithstanding the absence of a cross-reference contained
therein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing
(or inclusion of a copy) of a document or other item shall not be deemed
adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein
(unless the representation or warranty has to do with the existence of the
document or other item itself). The parties intend that each representation,
warranty, and covenant contained herein shall have independent significance.
For purposes of this Agreement, the obligation to use "reasonable best
efforts" and "commercially reasonable efforts" shall not require a party to
pay any consent fee, profit sharing payment or any other consideration for
any consent, approval or amendment (except for filing fees, other
administrative charges and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses). Any
dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a benchmark
for determinations of what is or is not "material" or a "Material Adverse
Effect" under this Agreement. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise
requires (i) words of any gender include each other gender; (ii) words using
the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number,
respectively; and (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereunder" and
derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement.

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the capitalized terms used herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms herein and the following terms
shall have the following meanings:



 

83 (i) "Affiliate" of any Person means any Person that controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with such Person. As used herein,
the term "control" (including the terms "controlling", "controlled by"
and "under common control with") means the possession, directly or
indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management
and policies of a Person, whether through ownership of voting securities or
other interests, by contract or otherwise. In addition, any Person who is a
director or executive officer of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof shall
be deemed an "Affiliate" thereof.

 (ii) "Business Day" means a day other than Saturday, Sunday or
