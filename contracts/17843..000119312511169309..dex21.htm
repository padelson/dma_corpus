for exchange of Company Capital Stock in accordance with this Agreement;

 



20 (ii) the issuance and deposit of certificates representing the Escrow
Parent Shares with the Escrow Agent;

(iii) on behalf of the Company, payment of Indebtedness of the Company unpaid
at the Closing, in amounts set forth in the Payoff Letters delivered by the

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Parent will engage the Exchange Agent. As soon
as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall cause to be mailed or
otherwise delivered to each Equityholder a letter of transmittal (each, a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_. After
the Effective Time, subject to the receipt by the Company or the Exchange
Agent of a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal, accompanied by
all documents, agreements and instruments required thereby, each holder of a
certificate or certificates representing Company Shares, other than
certificates representing Company Shares held in the Companys treasury or
beneficially owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other Affiliate of
Parent, or representing Dissenting Shares (collectively, the " _Certificates_
"), shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor such number of Parent
Shares (less the number of Escrow Parent Shares to be deposited with the
Escrow Agent on such holders behalf pursuant to _Section 2.10(a)(ii)_),
rounded (up or down) to the nearest whole share, that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of _Section 2.8(a)_
with respect to such Certificates, and such Certificates shall, after such
surrender, be marked as cancelled.

(c) If any consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it
shall be a condition to such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange
shall deliver such Certificate accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and shall pay to the Surviving Corporation
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of such
consideration to a Person other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate so surrendered, or such Person shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable.

(d) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall pay such portion of the Closing
Consideration as may be required pursuant to this Agreement in exchange
therefor, without interest thereon, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof, together with an unsecured indemnity in customary

 



21  form in favor of the Surviving Corporation, as a condition precedent to the
payment of any Closing Consideration attributable to such Company Shares.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no transfers of any Company Shares.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.10_, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender such portion of the
Closing Consideration as may be required pursuant to this Agreement in
exchange therefor in respect of such security represented by such Certificate.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled, delivered to the Exchange Agent and
exchanged for the respective portion of the Closing Consideration they
represent, as provided in this _Article II_.

Section 2.11 _Company Options and Company Warrants_. The Company shall take
all actions necessary, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, to cause
each Company Option and Company Warrant that is outstanding and unexercised
as of the Effective Time to be terminated as of the Effective Time without any
payment therefor. Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5.1_ to the contrary,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company may take any action necessary to
provide that any or all Company Options that are not exercisable shall become
exercisable, may provide for payment of the Company Option exercise price in
any manner permitted by the Stock Plan, and may take any other action
permitted by the Stock Plan to effectuate this _Section 2.11_.

Section 2.12 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, each share of Company Capital Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a
Stockholder who has properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into or exchangeable for the right to receive Parent Shares as otherwise
provided in _Section 2.8(a)_, but shall be entitled to receive such
consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if such Stockholder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses the right to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL, the shares of Company Capital Stock of such Stockholder shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as
of the Effective Time, the right to receive such number of Parent
Shares (less the number of Escrow Parent Shares to be deposited with the
Escrow Agent on such holders behalf pursuant to _Section 2.10(a)(ii)_),
rounded (up or down) to the nearest whole share, that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of _Section 2.8(a)_
with respect to such shares of Company Capital Stock. No later than the tenth
Business Day following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall provide
notice in accordance with the DGCL to each Stockholder entitled to appraisal
rights. To the extent the notice is sent to Equityholders that are not
Accredited Investors, included with the notice shall be such information
required to be furnished to investors who are not Accredited Investors
pursuant to Rule 502 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for appraisals of Shares, Parent shall have the right to reasonably
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, Parent
shall have the right to reasonably approve any payment made in respect of
Dissenting Shares and the Company shall cooperate with Parent in
connection therewith and take all actions reasonably requested by Parent.

 



22 Section 2.13 _Closing Consideration Adjustment_.

 

(a) The parties have contemplated that the Adjusted Working Capital of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Working Capital Measurement Time (the
" _Closing Working Capital_ "), as calculated in accordance with and set forth
on the Form of Working Capital Statement attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the "
_Working Capital Statement_ ") will be $200,700,000 (the " _Working Capital
Target_ "). The term Indebtedness as used in this _Section 2.13_ and in the
defined terms used within this _Section 2.13_, shall not include the
Retained Indebtedness.

(b) The Company shall cause to be prepared and, within 10 Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, but in no event less than three Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, shall cause to be delivered to Parent, a certificate signed
by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company attaching (i) a good faith
projected unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date
prepared in accordance with GAAP using the Company Methodology and (ii) a good
faith estimate of the Closing Working Capital (the " _Estimated Working
Capital_ "), together with such schedules and data with respect to the
determination of the Estimated Working Capital as may be appropriate to
support such calculation of the Estimated Working Capital. Following delivery
of the Estimated Working Capital, the Company shall provide Parent and its
representatives with reasonable access to the employees, agreements and books
and records of the Company to verify the accuracy of such amounts. In the
event that Parent does not agree with the Estimated Working Capital, the
Company and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to mutually agree on
acceptable Estimated Working Capital. The Company shall consider in good faith
any proposed comments or changes that Parent may reasonably suggest;
_provided, however,_  that the Companys failure to include any changes
proposed by Parent, or the acceptance by Parent of the Estimated Working
Capital, shall not limit or otherwise affect Parents remedies under this
Agreement. If the Estimated Working Capital is less than the Working Capital
Target, then the Consideration Shares shall be reduced by an amount equal to
the quotient of (i) the difference of (A) the Working Capital Target less (B)
the Estimated Working Capital, divided by (ii) the Closing Date Share Value
(such amount shall be the " _Closing Adjustment_ "). In the event the
Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital Target, the Closing
Adjustment shall be zero.

 

(c) Parent shall cause to be prepared and, as soon as practical, but in no
event later than 60 days after the Closing Date, shall cause to be delivered
to the Representatives, a statement setting forth Parents calculation of
Closing Working Capital (including each component item as set forth on the
Working Capital Statement), together with such schedules and data with
respect to the determination of the Closing Working Capital as may be
appropriate to support such calculation (the " _Initial Calculation_ "). In
connection with the Initial Calculation, Parent and the Company will
collaborate to undertake a physical inventory count (conducted in accordance
with the Company Methodology) (the " _Physical Inventory Count_ "). The
Physical Inventory Count will be conducted by the Company and each of Parent,
the Company and Representatives shall be allowed to have representatives
present during the conduct of the Physical Inventory Count. Parent, the
Company and the Representatives agree that in the event the results of the
Physical Inventory Count (the " _Physical Inventory_ ") show that amount for
"inventory" that was used in the determination of the Estimated Working
Capital (the " _Book Inventory_ ") is within $3 million above or below
the Physical Inventory, then the Book

 



23  Inventory shall be used in the determination of Closing Working Capital in
the Initial Calculation. In the event the Physical Inventory is more than $3
million higher or lower than the Book Inventory, then an amount equal to the
Physical Inventory _plus_ $3 million (in the event Physical Inventory is less
than Book Inventory) or _minus_ $3 million (in the event Physical Inventory is
greater than Book Inventory), in either such case, shall be used in the
determination of Closing Working Capital in the Initial Calculation.

(d) Within 30 days after receipt by the Representatives of the Initial
Calculation, the Representatives may deliver to Parent a written notice (the "
_Calculation Notice_ ") either (i) advising Parent that the Representatives
agree with and accept the Initial Calculation or (ii) setting forth an
explanation in reasonable detail of those items in the Initial Calculation
that the Representatives dispute and of what the Representatives believe is
the correct calculation of Closing Working Capital. The Representatives and
the accountants engaged by the Representative shall be entitled to review the
Companys working papers, trial balances and similar materials for purposes of
reviewing the Initial Calculation. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall provide the Representatives and the accountants
engaged by the Representatives with (i) the reasonable assistance of Company
personnel and (ii) timely and reasonable access, during the Companys normal
business hours, to the Companys personnel, properties, books and records, in
each case at the Companys expense. If the Representatives do not submit a
Calculation Notice within the 30-day period provided herein, then the Initial
Calculations shall become final and shall not be subject to further review,
challenge or adjustment. Parent and its accountants shall be entitled to
review the working papers, trial balances and similar materials relating to
the Representatives preparation of its Calculation Notice. If Parent shall
concur with the Calculation Notice, or if Parent shall not object to the
Calculation Notice in a writing received by the Representatives within 30 days
after Parents receipt of the Calculation Notice, the calculation of each of
the Closing Working Capital set forth in the Calculation Notice shall become
final and shall not be subject to further review, challenge or adjustment.

 

(e) In the event that the Representatives and Parent are unable to resolve any
disputes regarding the Closing Working Capital within 15 days after the date
of Parents objection to the Calculation Notice, then such disputes shall be
referred to a nationally recognized independent registered public accounting
firm selected by mutual agreement of Parent and the Representatives (the "
_Settlement Accountants_ "), and the determination of the Settlement
Accountants shall be final and shall not be subject to further review,
challenge or adjustment, absent fraud. The Settlement Accountants shall
determine the Closing Working Capital in accordance with the standards and
methodologies described in this _Section 2.13_ and shall be instructed by
Parent and the Representatives to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
reach such determination not more than 30 days after such referral. Nothing
herein shall be construed to authorize or permit the Settlement Accountants to
resolve any item in dispute by making an adjustment to the Initial
Calculations that is outside of the range for such item defined by the
Initial Calculations and the Calculation Notice. In calculating the Closing
Working Capital, the Settlement Accountants shall be limited to addressing any
particular disputes referred to in the Calculation Notice. Each party shall
pay its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with this _Section
2.13_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Equityholders, on the one hand, and
Parent, on the other hand, shall each bear one-half of the fees and expenses
of the Settlement Accountants, with the amount payable by the Equityholders to
be paid in cash on their behalf by

 



24  Parent but with Parent and the Equityholders concurrently instructing the
Escrow Agent to remove from the aggregate number of shares held by the Escrow
Agent a number of shares (rounded up or down to the nearest whole share)
equal to the quotient of (i) such amount of fees and expenses so allocated to
the Equityholders yet paid by the Parent and (ii) the Closing Date Share
Value, which removed shares shall be returned to Parent, deemed to be
cancelled and all rights any Equityholder may have to such shares shall be
extinguished.

(f) The Closing Working Capital as finally determined and agreed to by the
Representatives and Parent (or as determined by the Settlement Accountants)
shall be the " _Final Working Capital_."

 

(g) The " _Closing Consideration Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive
or negative, shall mean the Final Working Capital _minus_ the Estimated
Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance with this _Section
2.13_. The " _Final Adjustment_ " shall mean the absolute value of the
quotient of the Closing Consideration Adjustment Amount divided by the
Closing Date Share Value.

(h) If the Closing Consideration Adjustment Amount is a positive number and
the Closing Adjustment resulted in a reduction of the Net Closing Parent
Shares, then Parent shall issue and deliver to the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to the Equityholders in accordance with their
Allocable Percentage, certificates representing such number of Parent Shares
(rounded up or down to the nearest whole share) equal to the lesser of (i) the
Closing Adjustment and (ii) the Final Adjustment.

 

(i) If the Closing Consideration Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then,
for each Equityholder in accordance with their Allocable Percentage, such
number of Parent Shares (rounded up or down to the nearest whole share) equal
to the greater of (i) the Final Adjustment and (ii) an amount equal to the
quotient of (A) the difference of (1) the Working Capital Target less (2) the
Final Working Capital, divided by (B) the Closing Date Share Value, (in either
case, the " _Working Capital Cancelled Parent Shares_ ") shall be returned to
Parent, deemed to be cancelled and all rights such Equityholder may have to
such Parent Shares shall be extinguished. Parent and Representatives shall
inform the Escrow Agent that the Indemnity Escrow Parent Shares held by the
Escrow Agent shall be reduced by such number of Working Capital Cancelled
Parent Shares.

(j) If the Estimated Working Capital and the Final Working Capital exceed the
Working Capital Target, then, regardless of the value of the Closing
Consideration Adjustment Amount, no further actions shall be taken in
connection with this _Section 2.13_.

 

(k) Amounts determined pursuant to this _Section 2.13_ shall be deemed an
adjustment to Closing Consideration.

 

Section 2.14 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, Surviving Corporation,
Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it reasonably determines is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of applicable
law. If the Company, Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be, so withholds any such amounts, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
applicable Equityholder in respect of which the Company, Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Exchange

 



25  Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. Any
withholding pursuant to this _Section 2.14_ shall be determined using the
Closing Date Share Value (if occurring in connection with Parent Shares
received at Closing) or the applicable Release Date Share Value (if occurring
in connection with Parent Shares received after the Closing). The Parent
Shares representing the amounts withheld shall be returned to Parent, deemed
to be cancelled and all rights any Equityholder may have to such shares shall
be extinguished.

 

Section 2.15 _Limitation on Parent Shares; Exemption from Registration._

 

(a) Other than adjustments made pursuant to _Section 1.3(h)_, notwithstanding
anything else in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent be required to
deliver, and the Equityholders shall not be entitled to receive, more than
8,100,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, other than to the extent resulting
from rounding adjustments contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) The Parent Shares to be issued in connection with the Merger shall be
issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act, by
reason of Section 4(2) thereof and/or Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act and may not be re-offered or resold other than in conformity
with the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such other
laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. The certificates issued by Parent
with respect to the Parent Shares issued hereunder shall be legended to the
effect described above and shall include such additional legends as necessary
to comply with applicable U.S. federal securities laws, Blue Sky laws and
such other restrictions as shall be set forth in the Stockholders Agreement.

(c) The Company and Representatives shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause all Equityholders to execute such documents as Parent may determine
to be necessary to ensure that the Parent Shares to be issued in connection
with the Merger are issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the
Securities Act, by reason of Section 4(2) thereof and/or Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act.

under Rule 13a-15(a) and 15d-15(a) of the Exchange Act that are reasonably
designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent, including
its Subsidiaries, required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange
Act is made known to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer
of Parent by others within those entities to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure as required under the Exchange Act and is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
by the SECs rules and forms. Parent has evaluated the effectiveness of

transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, (B) that receipts and expenditures are

of Parent or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of Parent.

pay any finders fee, brokerage fees or commission or similar payment in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

out-of-pocket payments and deductibles paid prior to any such change in

under such new or changed plan, but only to the extent that such new or
changed plan is implemented during the plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs.

Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plan or to
continue the employment of any specific Person with Parent, Acquisition Sub,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

 

(c) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that
all provisions contained in this _Section 5.8_ are included for the sole
benefit of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company and that nothing in this
Agreement, whether express or implied, (i) shall be treated as an amendment or
other modification of any Employee Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or
other arrangement, (ii) shall limit the right of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Company, or their respective Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise
modify any Employee Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or other

plant closing, mass layoff or other termination (whether actual or
constructive) of employees which, either alone or in the aggregate (with each
other and/or with any plant closing, mass layoff or other termination of
employees occurring on or prior to the Closing Date), would reasonably be
expected to create any liability to the Equityholders under the WARN Act or
similar applicable law.

 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification; Insurance_.

(a) From and until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with all obligations of the Company
in existence or 

 



60  in effect as of the date hereof, under applicable Regulations, its
Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws or by contract, to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, and also advance expenses as incurred, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Regulations to, each Person who is now or has been
prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer
or director of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (the "
_Indemnified Officers_ ") against all Losses arising out of or in connection
with any Action based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part
out of the fact that such Person is or was an officer or director of the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, whether or not pertaining to any
matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether or
not asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time. The parties
hereto intend, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.9_ shall apply without
limitation to acts or omissions, other than illegal acts or acts of fraud, or
alleged acts or omissions, other than illegal acts or acts of fraud, by the
Indemnified Officers in their capacities as officers or directors, as the case
may be, Parent hereby guarantees the payment and performance of the Surviving
Corporations obligations in this  _Section 5.9_. Each Indemnified Officer,

rights any Indemnified Officer may have under any agreement with the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company or under the Companys or any such
Subsidiarys organizational documents.

Corporation and the Subsidiaries to procure, pay for and maintain in effect
"tail" insurance or other insurance policies with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered
by the Companys or any Subsidiarys directors and officers liability
insurance at least to the same extent as such directors and officers are
currently covered. Every Person who is a director or officer of the Company or
a Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be a named insured
party on such policies of directors and officers liability insurance for
such six year period following the Effective Time. The Company shall have the
authority prior to the Closing to procure on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation such directors and officers liability insurance coverage to take
effect as of the Effective Time, and the Surviving Corporation shall be
responsible for all costs relating to such insurance.

 

(c) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, (A)
if the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation are
Related Parties, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume
the indemnification and other obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_,
or (B) if the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
are not Related Parties, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such successors and assigns to assume the indemnification and other
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 

Section 5.10 _FIRPTA_. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to the Parent
such forms and certificates, duly executed and acknowledged, in form and

Section 5.11 _Certain Notices_. From the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto of the following matters of which the notifying party has knowledge:
(a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or event after the date of
this Agreement that would reasonably be likely to cause any representation or
warranty of the notifying party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect as of the date hereof or as of the Closing
Date; (b) any failure of the notifying party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant or condition to be complied with or satisfied by such party hereunder
in any material respect as of the Closing Date; (c) any written notice or
other communication from any Person alleging that the consent or approval of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or that such transactions otherwise may violate
the rights of or confer remedies upon such Person, except where the failure to
obtain such consent or approval would not be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable; (d)
any written notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (e) any
Actions commenced relating to the Company or any Subsidiary, on the one hand,
or Parent or Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, that, if pending on the date
of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant
to this Agreement; (f) any repurchases of any Company Shares by the Company;
and (g) any transfers of record of Company Shares effectuated on the stock
ledger of the Company during the Pre-Closing Period. If any such event
requires any change to the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall
promptly deliver to Parent a supplement to the Company Disclosure Schedule
specifying such change and while such supplement shall not be taken
into consideration for purposes of determining whether the Company satisfies
the closing condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_, following the Closing,
if any, no Parent Indemnified Party will have the right to seek
indemnification hereunder for any such event.

Section 5.12 _Preservation of Books and Records_. Each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation agrees to preserve and keep, or cause to be preserved
and kept, all original books and records in respect of the Business in the
possession of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates
for a period of seven years after the Closing Date (the " _Record Retention
Period_ "). Each Representative or its respective representatives, upon
reasonable notice and for any reasonable business purpose, shall have access
during normal business hours to examine, inspect and copy such books and
records; _provided_ , that, such Representative agrees that such access will
give due regard to minimizing interference with the operations, activities and
employees of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall provide either Representative and their representatives
with, or cause to be provided to the either Representative and their
respective representatives, such original books and records of the Business
as either Representative shall reasonably request in connection with any
Action to which either Representative or any Equityholder is a party or in
connection with the requirements of any law applicable to either
Representative or any Equityholder. After the Record Retention Period, before
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates shall
dispose of any of such books and records, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall give at least 90 calendar days prior written notice of such intention
to dispose to the

 



62  Representatives, and the Representatives shall be given an opportunity to
remove and retain all or any part of such books and records as either
Representative may elect.

 

Section 5.13 _Treatment as Reorganization_. This Agreement is intended to
constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Reg. §
1.368-2(g). The parties hereto intend that the Merger qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations and will report it as such for all federal, state and
local income tax purposes. None of the parties hereto will knowingly take any
action or fail to take any action, other than those contemplated by this
Agreement, which action or failure would cause the Merger to fail to qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, negotiation, settlement
or payment of appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall
be treated as an action taken pursuant to this Agreement. Each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the opinion referred to in _Section 6.2(e)_. Each party hereto
agrees to cooperate with the other parties and to provide to the other
parties such information and documentation as may be necessary, proper or
advisable, to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. Each of
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to make the representations referred to in _Section 6.2(e)_ to Jones
Day or Pepper Hamilton LLP, as applicable.

Section 5.14 _Asterisked Items_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, copies of the Asterisked Items have not yet been
provided to Parent and the Company shall deliver copies of all Asterisked
Items no later than the tenth Business Day after the date of this Agreement
(such date, the " _Delivery Deadline_ "). The Asterisked Items shall not be
deemed disclosed or to otherwise have qualified (or to qualify) the Companys
representations or warranties in this Agreement unless and until Parent fails
to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
7.1(f)_ within the time provided therein, at which time the Asterisked Items
shall be automatically deemed to have been disclosed and to have qualified
(and to qualify) the Companys representations and warranties in
this Agreement in all respects.

(b) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge that
the Company may determine, prior to the Delivery Deadline, that certain of
the Asterisked Items are not required to be listed on the Company Disclosure
Schedule. The Company shall so notify Parent in writing of any such items on
or before the Delivery Deadline and, upon such notification, such items shall
automatically be deemed removed from the Company Disclosure Schedule for all
purposes.

this _Article VIII_ , Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and
severally indemnify and hold harmless Equityholders and their respective
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, members, partners and agents (" _Equityholder Indemnified
Parties_ ") for Losses incurred by the Equityholder Indemnified Parties by
reason of, resulting from, or arising out of:

 

(i) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty made by Parent or Acquisition
Sub in _Article IV_ ;

 

(ii) any breach or nonperformance by Parent or Acquisition Sub of its
covenants or agreements in this Agreement; and 

(iii) the operation of the business of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates after the Effective Time
(except to the extent a matter is subject to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)_ above).

Section 8.3 _Limitation on Indemnity._

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for Losses with respect
to any particular matter unless and until the Losses applicable to such matter
exceed $175,000; _provided_ , that, if 

 



68  the Losses applicable to such matter exceed $175,000, then the party
obligated to provide indemnification (the " _Indemnitor_ ") shall be liable
for all Losses applicable to such matter, subject to the provisions of this
_Article VIII_ ; _provided further_ , that in each case, any Losses or series
of Losses arising out of the same facts or occurrences shall be considered
Losses applicable to the same matter. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,

 

(i) a Parent Indemnified Party shall have no right to indemnification pursuant
to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ and an Equityholder Indemnified Party shall have no
right to indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ unless and until the
aggregate amount of all Losses suffered by such Parent Indemnified Party
hereunder exceeds an amount equal to $4,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and
then, subject to _Sections 8.3(b)(ii)_ and _8.3(b)(iv)_ below, only to the
extent of the excess; _provided_ , that, the Deductible shall not be
applicable to (A) claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_
with respect to claims of misrepresentation or breach of warranty set forth in
_Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3_ and _3.4_ or (B) claims for indemnification
pursuant to  _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ with respect to claims of misrepresentation
or breach of warranty set forth in _Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ and _4.8_ ,
_provided further_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that Losses not recoverable
as a result of the operation of _Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ shall
not be included for purposes of determining whether the Deductible has been
met or exceeded nor shall such Losses be otherwise recoverable under this
Agreement; 

(ii) the sole source from which the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to indemnity is the Indemnity Escrow Parent Shares;

(iii) the Parent Indemnified Parties rights to indemnification will be
reduced by all insurance proceeds actually received by, net of all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements) incurred by, the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to
insurance policies issued for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that are in effect as of the date hereof (or renewals (the total
cost of which has been paid in full) of such policies in the ordinary course
of business prior to the Closing Date), and the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to claim and recover any Losses
suffered by the Parent Indemnified Parties under any such insurance policies.
In addition, if any of the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification for any Losses regarding Environmental Laws or Hazardous
Substances pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of
December 6, 2006, by and among The Timken Company, Latrobe Steel Company,
Timken Alloy Steel Europe Limited, Toolrock Holdings, Inc. and Toolrock
Acquisition LLC (the " _Timken Agreement_ "), then Parent shall make an
indemnity claim with respect to such Losses under the Timken Agreement as
further specified on _Annex A_ ; and

 

(iv) the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Equityholder Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to indemnity pursuant to  _Section 8.2(b)_ shall
not exceed $50,000,000.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
no Indemnified Party shall have any right or entitlement to indemnification
from any Indemnitor for

 



69  any Losses relating to any matter arising under the provisions of this
Agreement to the extent that any such Indemnified Party or its successors and
assigns had already recovered Losses with respect to the same matter pursuant
to any other provision of this Agreement, and such Indemnified Parties and its
successors and assigns shall be deemed to have waived and released any claims
for such Losses and shall not be entitled to assert any such claim for
indemnification for such Losses.

(d) The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that in connection
with the obligation under this _Article VIII_ to indemnify for a
misrepresentation or breach of the Companys representations and warranties,
the representations and warranties shall be read and construed as if each of
the following qualifiers were not set forth in such representations and
warranties: "Company Material Adverse Effect;" "material adverse effect;"
"materiality;" "material" and words of similar meaning.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b)(i) above, to the extent
the Surviving Corporation actually receives a final (as opposed to a
provisional) refund with respect to the Fiscal 2010 Tax Return (" _Received
Refund_ "), a Parent Indemnified Party shall have no right to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ with respect to claims of misrepresentation
or breach of warranty set forth in _Sections 3.10_ unless and until the
aggregate amount of all Losses suffered by such Parent Indemnified Party
hereunder exceeds an amount equal to the Received Refund (less any amount
attributable to the Fiscal 2010 Tax Return included in the calculation of Net
Working Capital) then, subject to _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_, only to the extent of
the excess. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event a refund with respect to
the Fiscal 2010 Tax Return is received by the Company prior to the Closing,
this _Section 8.3(e)_ shall be void and have no effect.

(f) No party shall be liable under this _Article VIII_ for any Losses
resulting from or relating to any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement if the party seeking
indemnification for such Losses had Knowledge of such breach as a result of
having conducted (whether through a third party or otherwise) any
environmental assessment or investigation or, solely with respect to the
condition of Assets, environmental matters and Regulations directly related
to health and safety of employees, any site visit or inspection of the
facilities or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 8.4 _Exclusivity of Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the remedies
set forth in _Section 2.13_ (Closing Consideration Adjustment) and in this
_Article VIII_ shall be the exclusive remedies of the parties with respect to
any and all matters covered by this Agreement, except for the remedies of
specific performance, injunction and other equitable relief; _provided_ ,
that, no party hereto shall be deemed to have waived any claims for willful or
intentional breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the
obligations of the various parties under the Transaction Documents shall not
be limited by this _Section 8.4_.

Section 8.5 _Notice of Claims._

 

(a) Any Parent Indemnified Party or Equityholder Indemnified Party seeking
indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall, within the
period provided for in _Section 8.1_, give, in the case of indemnification
sought by (i) any Equityholder Indemnified

 



70  Party, to Parent, or (ii) any Parent Indemnified Party, to the
Representatives, a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification
hereunder that is the subject of the Claim Notice. The Claim Notice shall
include (if and to the extent then known) the amount and the method of
computation of the amount of such claim, a reference to the provision of this
Agreement upon which such claim is based and all material documentation
relevant to the claim (to the extent not previously provided under this
_Section 8.5_). A Claim Notice shall be given promptly following
the claimants determination that facts or events are reasonably expected to
give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder; _provided_ , that, the
failure to give such written notice shall not relieve any Indemnitor of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent it demonstrates actual and
material prejudice by such failure. The failure to submit all relevant
documentation with a Claim Notice or otherwise abide by the procedural
covenants set forth in this  _Section 8.5_ shall not result in the purported
Claim Notice not being a proper Claim Notice hereunder, except to the extent
such failure results in actual and material prejudice to the parties required
to provide the indemnity pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) An Indemnitor (acting through Parent, in the case of indemnification
sought by an Equityholder Indemnified Party, and acting through the
Representatives, in the case of indemnification sought by a Parent Indemnified
Party) shall have until 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the 30th day after the giving
of any proper Claim Notice pursuant hereto to (i) agree to the amount or
method of determination set forth in the Claim Notice and to pay or cause to
be paid such amount to such Indemnified Party in immediately available funds
or (ii) provide such Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent (in the case of
indemnification sought by a Parent Indemnified Party) with written notice
that it disagrees with the amount or method of determination set forth in the
Claim Notice (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). For a period of 30 days after the
giving of any Dispute Notice, a representative of the Indemnitor and the
Indemnified Party shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the matter. In the
event that the controversy is not resolved within 30 days after the date the
Dispute Notice is given, the parties may thereupon proceed to pursue any and
all available remedies at law. If (x) the Indemnitor agrees to the Claim
Notice pursuant to clause (i) above or fails to provide a timely Dispute
Notice pursuant to clause (ii) above or resolves the disagreement described
in a Dispute Notice with the Indemnified Party, and, in any such case, the
Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnified Party, or (y) a final, non-
appealable Court Order is issued finding that an Parent Indemnified Party
is entitled to indemnification for Losses hereunder, then, in either such
case, for each Equityholder, such number of Parent Shares (rounded up or down
to the nearest whole share) equal to such Equityholders Allocable Percentage
multiplied by an amount equal to the amount set forth in the Claim Notice or
Court Order or the resolved amount (as applicable) divided by the appropriate
per share value of Parent Shares determined pursuant to _Section 8.7(c)_ (the
" _Indemnity Cancelled Parent Shares_ ") shall be returned to Parent, deemed
to be cancelled and all rights such Equityholder may have to such Parent
Shares shall be extinguished. Parent and Representatives shall promptly inform
the Escrow Agent of the number of Indemnity Cancelled Parent Shares and shall
take such action as is necessary to have the Escrow Agent promptly return to
the Parent certificates representing such number of Indemnity Cancelled Parent
Shares. If (x) the Indemnitor agrees to the Claim Notice pursuant to clause
(i) above or fails to provide a timely Dispute Notice pursuant to clause (ii)
above or resolves the disagreement described in a Dispute Notice with the
Indemnified Party, and, in any such case, the Indemnified Party is an
Equityholder Indemnified Party, or (y) a final, non-appealable Court Order is
issued finding an

 



71  Equityholder Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification for Losses
hereunder, then, in either such case, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid
to, the Representative for the benefit of the Equityholder Indemnified
Parties in accordance with their respective Allocable Percentages, an amount
in cash equal to the amount set forth in the Claim Notice or Court Order or
the resolved amount (as applicable).

 

(c) Other than with respect to the right to submit a Dispute Notice pursuant
to _Section 8.5(b)_ and the last two sentences of  _Section 8.5(b)_, for
which parallel mechanics shall apply to _Section 8.6_, the provisions of this
_Section 8.5_ shall not apply in the case of a Claim Notice provided in
connection with a claim by a third Person made against an Indemnified Party,
which claims shall be governed by _Section 8.6_.

Section 8.6 _Third Person Claims._

(a) If a claim by a third Person is made against an Indemnified Party
(including a claim with respect to Taxes), and if such Indemnified Party
intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under this _Article VIII_ ,
such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify (i) Parent, in the case of
indemnification sought by any Equityholder Indemnified Party, or (ii) the
Representatives and the Escrow Agent, in the case of indemnification sought by
any Parent Indemnified Party, in writing of such claims (a " _Third Party
Claim Notice_ "). The Third Party Claim Notice shall describe (if and to the
extent then known) in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for
indemnification hereunder that is the subject of the Third Party Claim Notice,
the amount and the method of computation of the amount of such claim, a
reference to the provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is based
and all material documentation relevant to the claim described in the Third
Party Claim Notice (to the extent not previously provided under this 
_Section 8.6_). A Third Party Claim Notice shall be given promptly following
the claimants determination that facts or events are reasonably expected to
give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder; _provided_ , that,
the failure to give such written notice shall not relieve any Indemnitor of
its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure results in actual
and material prejudice to the parties required to provide the indemnity
pursuant to this Agreement. The failure to submit all relevant documentation
with a Third Party Claim Notice or otherwise abide by the procedural covenants
set forth in this _Section 8.6_ shall not result in the purported Third Party
Claim Notice not being a proper Third Party Claim Notice hereunder, except to
the extent it demonstrates actual and material prejudice by such failure.

(b) The Indemnitor (acting through Parent, in the case of indemnification
sought by any Equityholder Indemnified Party, and acting through the
Representatives, in the case of indemnification sought by a Parent
Indemnified Party) shall have 30 days after receipt of such Third Party Claim
Notice to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing
(who shall be subject to the approval of the Indemnified Party, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and at its own
expense, the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with it in connection therewith. In such event, an Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate with its own counsel at its own expense,
_provided_ that, if in the reasonable opinion of counsel for such Indemnified
Party, there is a reasonable likelihood of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnitor and the Indemnified Party, then the reasonable cost of one counsel
for the Indemnified Party shall be borne by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor
does not notify the Indemnified Party in writing within 30 days

 



72  after receipt of the Indemnified Partys written notice of a third Person
claim that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to undertake the defense or prosecution of the claim
through counsel of its own choice, and the reasonable fees and expenses
incurred in connection with such defense or prosecution shall be considered
Losses hereunder with respect to the subject matter of such claim,
indemnifiable to the extent provided in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_. In
the event the Indemnitor is required by this Agreement to pay the costs of
counsel of an Indemnified Party then the selection of such counsel shall be
subject to the approval of the Indemnitor which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

(c) The Indemnitor shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified
Party, enter into any settlement or compromise any claim by a third Person
that (i) does not include as a term thereof the giving by the Person or
Persons asserting such claim to all Indemnified Parties of a complete and
unconditional release from all Liability (subject to the application of
the Deductible) with respect to such claim or consent to entry of any
judgment, (ii) does not contain a finding of responsibility or Liability on
the part of the Indemnified Party (other than the payment of cash for which
the Indemnitor pays in full simultaneously with the effectiveness of the
settlement and upon payment of which the Indemnitor waives any right to seek
reimbursement from the Indemnified Party (subject to the application of the
Deductible)) or (iii) involves any non-monetary relief or remedy, including
any restrictions on the Indemnified Partys ability to operate or compete. Any
consent required by this _Section 8.6(c)_ shall not be unreasonably delayed,
withheld or conditioned. If the Indemnified Party is controlling the defense
of any claim to which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ , it shall not enter into any settlement or compromise any
claim by a third Person without the written consent of the Indemnitor, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Representatives shall not settle, compromise or conclude any claim with
respect to Taxes without the prior written consent of Parent.

(d) Each party shall have reasonable access during normal business hours to
the employees, books and records of the other party for purposes of
investigating the merits of any claim which is the subject of investigation;
_provided_ , that, the parties agree that such access will give due regard to
minimizing interference with the operations, activities and employees of the
other party. Each party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve the confidentiality and/or privileged status of all confidential
and/or privileged information provided pursuant to such request.

Section 8.7 _Calculation of Damages_.

 

(a) Upon any Indemnified Party becoming aware of any claim as to which
indemnification may be sought by such Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ , an Indemnified Party shall utilize reasonable efforts,
consistent with normal practices and policies and good commercial practice, to
mitigate such damages.

 

(b) In no event shall any punitive, special, consequential or incidental
damages, loss of future revenue or income, business interruption, cost of
capital, loss of business

 



73  reputation or opportunity, or diminution in value be included in the
determination as to whether any Loss has occurred or as to the amount of any
Loss incurred.

 

(c) Except with regard to claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(v)_, all calculations intended to determine the number of Parent
Shares applicable to a particular claim for indemnification under this
_Article VIII_ shall be made using the Release Date Share Value as of the date
any Indemnity Escrow Parent Shares are to be released to the Equityholders or
returned to Parent and deemed cancelled and all calculations shall be rounded
up or down to the nearest whole share. Calculations intended to determine the
number of Parent Shares applicable to a claim for indemnification under 
_Section 8.2(a)(v)_ shall be made using the Closing Date Share Value.

Section 8.8 _Escrow Release_. 

(a) Release of the Indemnity Escrow Parent Shares shall be in accordance with
the provisions of this _Article VIII_ and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Release of the Pension Escrow Parent Shares shall be in accordance with
the provisions of the Escrow Agreement and _Annex B_.

ARTICLE IX

upon, without independent verification or investigation, all decisions made
by either Representative (even in the event such decision conflicts with the
decision of the other Representative) in connection with this Agreement.
Neither Representative will have liability to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or Acquisition Sub with respect to its decisions, actions taken or
omitted to be taken in its capacity as Representative, except (i) with respect
to a Representatives bad faith or willful misconduct and (ii) with respect
to any Liabilities arising from or Losses incurred by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or Acquisition Sub as a result of decision made, action
taken or omitted to be taken by a Representative conflicting with a decision
made, action taken or omitted to be taken by the other Representative. Each
Representative shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the
confidentiality and/or privileged status of all confidential and/or privileged
information of the parties accessed in connection with the carrying out of
its duties.

ARTICLE X

 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 10.1 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the

Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware without regard to the principles of conflicts of law
thereof. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction

obligations, it shall be permitted to make any public statement or filing
(which may include public disclosure of a copy of this Agreement) without

is required by applicable Regulations or the requirements of the SEC, the New
York Stock Exchange or other comparable foreign authorities or markets and
(ii) Parent has first provided a copy of such public statement or filing to
the Company and Representatives, (c), to the extent already publicly
disclosed by Parent, the Equityholders shall be permitted to disclose to their

Section 10.9 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors and
permitted assigns and, except as specifically provided herein, nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.10 _Personal Liability_. This Agreement shall not create, be deemed
to create, or permit any personal liability or obligation on the part of any
Person (a) who is a direct or indirect equityholder of Parent, Acquisition
Sub, the Representative or any Equityholder or (b) who is an officer,
director, employee, agent or representative of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Representative or any Equityholder.

Company and the Representatives hereby acknowledges and agrees that the
failure of any other party to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder,
including the failure to take all actions as are necessary on its part in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement to consummate
the Merger, may cause irreparable injury to the other parties, for which
damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each
of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company and the Representatives hereby
consents to, in addition to any other remedy which such party may have at law
or in equity, the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent
jurisdiction to compel performance of its obligations and to the granting by
any court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder,

extent permitted by law, hereby waives any defenses it may have to the remedy
of specific performance provided for herein.

Section 10.13 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed
by facsimile or other electronic format (including .pdf) in two or more

documentation and Tax Returns with respect thereto.

 

Section 10.15 _Conflict of Interest_. If the Equityholders or the
Representatives so desire, and without the need for any consent or waiver by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, Jones Day is permitted to represent the
Equityholders and/or the Representatives after the Closing in connection with
any matter, including without limitation anything related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any disagreement or dispute relating
thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing,
Jones Day is permitted to represent the Equityholders, the Representatives,
any of their agents and affiliates, or any one or more of them, in connection
with any negotiation, transaction or dispute ("dispute" includes litigation,
arbitration or other adversary proceeding) with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, any Subsidiary of Parent or any of their respective agents or
affiliates under or relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, and any related matter, such as claims for indemnification
and disputes involving employment or noncompetition or other agreements
entered into in connection with this Agreement. Upon and after the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall cease to have any
attorney-client relationship with Jones Day, unless and to the extent Jones
Day is specifically engaged in writing by the Surviving Corporation or any

 



79  Subsidiary thereof to represent the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
thereof after the Closing and either such engagement involves no conflict of
interest with respect to Equityholders or the Representatives or the
Equityholders, or the Representatives (as applicable) consent in writing at
the time to such engagement. Any such representation of the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof by Jones Day after the Closing will not
affect the foregoing provisions hereof. For example, and not by way of
limitation, even if Jones Day is representing the Surviving Corporation after
the Closing, Jones Day is permitted simultaneously to represent the
Equityholders and/or the Representatives in any matter, including any
disagreement or dispute relating hereto. Furthermore, Jones Day is permitted
to withdraw from any representation of the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary thereof in order to be able to represent or continue so
representing the Equityholders or the Representatives, subject to its
obligations under applicable laws and rules of professional conduct to assist
in a transition of new counsel for the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
thereof.

extent such securities are permitted to be publicly sold in a single sale
transaction pursuant to Rule 144 (or any successor

connection with the Shelf Registration as provided in Section 11, which

(a) No later than the date that is three months after the Closing Date (the "
_Rights Effective Date_ ") and subject to the other restrictions contained in
this Section 2, the Company use its commercially reasonable efforts to
prepare and file a registration statement on Form S-3 or another appropriate
form that the Company is eligible to use and which form shall be available for
the resale of Registrable Securities held by Holders on a continuous or
delayed basis in accordance with Section 415 of the Securities Act and
reasonable and customary methods of distribution as set forth in such
registration statement (the " _Shelf Registration_ ")

 



-3-   and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration
Statement to be declared effective. If the Company is a Well-Known Seasoned
Issuer at the time of filing the Shelf Registration with the SEC, such Shelf
Registration shall be designated by the Company as an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement.

(b) Subject to Section 2(c), so long as permitted by applicable law, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf
Registration continuously effective, supplemented and amended as necessary to
ensure that it is available for resales of Registrable Securities by Holders
and to ensure that it conforms with the requirements of this Agreement, until
the Holders no longer own Registrable Securities at which time the Company
shall have the right to terminate the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration.
The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file a new Shelf
Registration pursuant to Rule 415(a)(6) to the extent the initial Shelf
Registration was an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement that is no longer
available for resales of Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415(a)(5).

(c) Upon delivery to the Investor of a certificate signed by the chief
executive officer or chief financial officer of the Company stating that the
continued use of the Shelf Registration would require the Company to make an
Adverse Disclosure (the " _Notice_ "), the Company may suspend the Investor
Groups use of the Shelf Registration (a " _Shelf Suspension_ ");

 

(a) for as long as necessary to avoid the Adverse Disclosure as determined in
good faith by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the
Company, after consultation with the Companys legal counsel, but in no event
longer than 30 days; and

(b) for as long as necessary to avoid the Adverse Disclosure as determined in
good faith by the Board, after consultation with the Companys legal counsel,
at a properly convened meeting thereof or by unanimous written consent;

_provided_ that during any 365-day period a Shelf Suspension may only be in
effect for an aggregate of 90 days.

Except as required by applicable law, no Investor nor any of their Affiliates
and representatives shall make any public disclosure regarding, and shall
treat as confidential, any Shelf Suspension or Notice and the Investors shall
be responsible for breaches of confidentiality by their respective Affiliates
and representatives. In the event of a Shelf Suspension, each Investor agrees
that the Holders shall suspend use of the prospectus related to the Shelf
Registration in connection with any sale or purchase of or offer to sell or
purchase Registrable Securities upon receipt of the Notice. The Company
shall promptly notify the Investors upon the

 



-4-   termination of any Shelf Suspension and use commercially reasonable efforts
to promptly amend or supplement the Shelf Registration following the
termination of such Shelf Suspension, if necessary, so it does not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein not
misleading.

 

(d) The Company shall have the right to defer or suspend the filing or
effectiveness of a registration statement under Section 2 for a reasonable
period of time not to exceed 90 days if a prior registration statement of the
Company for an underwritten, public offering by the Company of its securities
was declared effective by the SEC less than 120 days prior to the
anticipated effective date of the registration under Section 2\.

(e) Each Investor agrees that neither an Investor nor any Holder or Affiliate
will take, directly or indirectly any action designed to stabilize or
manipulate the price of any security of the Company, except in each case as
may be permitted by applicable law.

 

(f) If any of the Registrable Securities to be sold under a Shelf Registration
pursuant to this Section 2 are to be sold in an underwritten offering, each
of (i) the Company and (ii) the Holders of a majority of such Registrable
Securities included in such offering, may select an Underwriter or
Underwriters to manage such offering which Underwriter or Underwriters shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Holders of a majority of such Registrable
Securities included in such offering or the Company, as applicable.

(g) Persons receiving in-kind distributions of shares of Common Stock from
Investors shall be permitted to participate in an offering shall be considered
"Holders Indemnitees" pursuant to Section 10(a) solely for such purpose
provided that such Persons become a party to this Agreement or otherwise enter
into reasonable and customary agreements relating thereto.

 



   3. | INCIDENTAL REGISTRATION. 
---|--- 
 

(a) Subject to the other restrictions contained in this Section 3, if the
Company proposes, other than pursuant to Section 2, to register any equity
securities of the Company (collectively, " _Other Securities_ ") for public
sale under the Securities Act (whether proposed to be offered for sale by the
Company or by any other Person) on a form and in a manner which would permit
registration of Registrable Securities for sale to the public under the
Securities Act, it will give prompt written notice (which notice shall specify
the intended method or methods of disposition) to Holders of its intention
to do so (such notice, an " _Incidental Notice_ "), and upon the written
request of Holders delivered to the Company within five (5) Business Days
after the giving of any such notice (which request shall specify the number
of Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by Holders) the

 



-5-   Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect, in
connection with the registration of the Other Securities, the registration
under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities which the Company has
been so requested to register by the Holders (a " _Piggyback Registration_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that:

(i) if, at any time after giving such written notice of its intention to
register Other Securities and prior to the effective date of the registration
statement filed in connection with such registration, the Company shall
determine for any reason not to register such Other Securities, the Company
may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to Holders, if
they requested registration, and thereupon the Company shall be relieved
of its obligation to register such Registrable Securities in connection with
the registration of such Other Securities (but not from its obligation to pay
Registration Expenses to the extent incurred in connection therewith as
provided in Section 11);

(ii) the Company will not be required to effect any registration of
Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 3 if the Company shall have
been advised by the managing underwriter for the offering selected by the
Company that, in such firms opinion, a registration of Registrable Securities
and other securities of the Company at that time may interfere with an
orderly sale and distribution of the securities being sold in such offering or
materially and adversely affect the price of such securities, then the Company
shall include in the registration statement applicable to such Piggyback
Registration only such securities as so advised by such underwriter can be
sold without such effect (the " _Maximum Piggyback Number_ ") as follows and
in the following priority:

 

(a) to the extent such public offering is the result of a registration
initiated by the Company, (1) _first_ , the Other Securities to be
registered for the Companys account, (2) _second_ , if the number of
securities under clause (1) above is less than the Maximum Piggyback Number,
the Registrable Securities requested to be registered pursuant to Section 3,
allocated _pro rata_ among the Registrable Securities which in the aggregate,
when added to the number of securities to be registered under clause (1)
above, equals the Maximum Piggyback Number, and (3) _third_ , if the number
of securities under clauses (1) and (2) above are less than the Maximum
Piggyback Number, all Other Securities requested to be included in such
registration, _pro rata_ , based on the number of Other
Securities beneficially owned by each such holder of Other Securities which
in the aggregate, when added to the number of securities to be registered
under clauses (1) and (2) above, equals the Maximum Piggyback Number; or

 

(b) to the extent such public offering is the result of a registration by any
Persons (other than the Company or the Holders) exercising a contractual
right to demand registration not included in this Agreement, (1) _first_ ,
all Other Securities owned by such Persons exercising the contractual right,
_pro rata_ , based on the number of Other Securities beneficially owned by
each such

 



-6-   holder of Other Securities, (2) _second_ , if the number of securities
under clause (1) above is less than the Maximum Piggyback Number, the
Registrable Securities as to which registration has been requested pursuant
to Section 3, _pro rata_ , based on the number of Registrable Securities
beneficially owned by such Holders which in the aggregate, when added to the
number of securities to be registered under clause (1) above, equals the
Maximum Piggyback Number, (3) _third_ ,, if the number of securities under
clauses (1) and (2) above are less than the Maximum Piggyback Number, all
Other Securities being sold by the Company which in the aggregate, when added
to the number of securities to be registered under clauses (1) and (2) above,
equals the Maximum Piggyback Number, and (4) _fourth_ , if the number of
securities under clauses (1), (2) and (3) above are less than the Maximum
Piggyback Number, all Other Securities requested to be included in such
registration by other holders thereof (other than the Company and the
Holders), _pro rata_ , based on the number of Other Securities beneficially
owned by each such holder of Other Securities which in the aggregate, when
added to the number of securities to be registered under clauses (1), (2) and
(3) above, equals the Maximum Piggyback Number;

 

(iii) the Company shall not be required to give notice of, or effect any
registration of Registrable Securities under this Section 3 incidental to,
the registration of any of its securities in connection with mergers,
consolidations, acquisitions, exchange offers, subscription offers, dividend
reinvestment plans or stock options or other employee benefit or compensation
plans. 

(b) The Incidental Notice and the contents thereof shall be kept confidential
by the Investors and their respective Affiliates and representatives, and the
Investors shall be responsible for breaches of confidentiality by their
respective Affiliates and representatives.

(c) The Company may not commence or permit the commencement of any sale of
Other Securities for its own account or the account of another Person that is
not a Holder in a public offering to which this Section 3 applies unless the
Holders shall have received the Incidental Notice in respect to such public
offering and had an opportunity of five (5) Business Days to respond to the
Company prior to the commencement of such sale of Other Securities. The
Holders electing to participate in a Piggyback Registration shall be permitted
to withdraw all or part of the Registrable Securities from a Piggyback
Registration at any time at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
effective date of the registration statement relating to such Piggyback
Registration.



   4. | HOLDBACKS. 
---|--- 

(a) Holders covenant and agree with the Company that Holders shall not
effect, if requested by the managing underwriters of an underwritten offering,
any public sale or distribution of equity securities of the Company, including
a sale 

 



-7-   pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act (except pursuant to this
Agreement) during the ten (10) Business Day period prior to, and during the
sixty (60) day period beginning on, (i) the effective date of the

managing underwriter, if any, may require.

(b) The Company covenants and agrees with the Holders not to effect
any public or private sale or distribution of equity securities of the
Company (other than distributions pursuant to employee benefit plans),
including a sale pursuant to Regulation D under the Securities Act (or Section
4(2) thereof), during the ten (10) Business Day period prior to, and during
the sixty (60) day period beginning with the consummation of an underwritten
takedown, or such other period as the managing underwriter may require, except
pursuant to registrations on Form S-4, Form S-8 or any successor form for the
registration of securities issued or to be issued in connection with a merger,
acquisition or employee benefit plan.

(c) Each Investor covenants and agrees that it will comply and cause its
Affiliates and representatives to comply with the prospectus delivery
requirements of the Securities Act as applicable to it (unless an exemption
therefrom is available) in connection with sales of Registrable Securities
pursuant to a registration statement and shall sell the Registrable Securities
under a registration statement only in accordance with a method
of distribution described in such registration statement.



   5. | REGISTRATION PROCEDURES. 
---|--- 
 

If and whenever the Company is required by the provisions of this Agreement to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect or cause a registration as
provided in this Agreement and at such times as customarily occur in
registered offerings or shelf takedowns, as applicable, the Company will:

(a) Use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC,

time as all securities covered thereby are no longer Registrable Securities;

changes in any such documents prior to or after the filing thereof as Holders
or the underwriter or the underwriters may request;

(d) Within a reasonable time prior to the filing of any document which is to
be incorporated by reference into a registration statement or a prospectus,
provide copies of such document to underwriters counsel and counsel for the

be reasonably requested by such counsel available for discussion of such
document;

 

(e) Use commercially reasonable efforts to comply in all material respects
with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of
all securities covered by such registration statement during the period during
which any such registration statement is required to be effective;

(f) Furnish to Holders and any underwriter of Registrable Securities, (i) such
number of copies (including manually executed and conformed copies) of such
registration statement and of each amendment thereof and supplement thereto
(including all annexes, appendices, schedules and exhibits), (ii) such number
of copies of the prospectus, used in connection with such registration
statement (including each preliminary prospectus, any summary prospectus and
the final prospectus), and (iii) such number of copies of other documents, in
each case as Holders or such underwriter may reasonably request;

(g) Use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify all
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement under the
securities or "blue sky" laws of states of the United States as Holders or
any underwriter shall reasonably request, and do any and all other acts and
things which may be reasonably requested by Holders or such underwriter to
consummate the offering and disposition of Registrable Securities in such
jurisdictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required
to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in
securities, subject itself to taxation, or consent to general service
of process in any jurisdiction wherein it is not then so qualified or
subject;

(h) Reasonably cooperate with Holders and the sole underwriter or managing
underwriter(s) of an underwritten offering of shares, if any, to facilitate
the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (or book-entry
confirmations) representing the shares to be sold and not bearing
any restrictive legends or stop orders; and enable such shares to be in such
denominations (consistent with the provisions of the governing documents
thereof) and registered in such names as the

 



-9-   Holders or the sole underwriter or managing underwriter of an underwritten
offering of shares, if any, may reasonably request at least five (5) days
prior to any sale of such shares; 

(i) Use, as soon as practicable after the effectiveness of the registration
statement, commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement to be registered with, or
approved by, such other United States public, governmental or regulatory
authorities, if any, as may be required in connection with the disposition
of such Registrable Securities;

(j) Use its commercially reasonable efforts to list the securities covered by
such registration statement on the NYSE (or any securities exchange on which

Registrable Securities are then permitted under the applicable rules of such
exchange;

 

(k) Make appropriate members of senior management reasonably available to
participate in meetings or conference calls with potential investors and make

or any state securities authority for amendments or supplements to a Shelf
Registration and prospectus or for additional information with respect to the
Shelf Registration and prospectus;

 

(m) Notify Holders as promptly as practicable and, if requested by Holders,
confirm such notification in writing, (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus
supplement has been filed with the SEC, and, with respect to a registration
statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has been
declared effective by the SEC, (ii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop
order or the coming to the Companys attention of the initiation of any
proceedings for such or a similar purpose, (iii) of the receipt by the Company
of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of
any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the
initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, (iv) of the
occurrence of any event which requires the making of any changes to a
registration statement or related prospectus so that such documents will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading (and the Company shall promptly prepare and furnish to Holders a
reasonable number of copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus such that,
as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities,
such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact

 



-10-   required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading), and
(v) of the Companys determination that the filing of a post-effective
amendment to the registration statement shall be necessary or appropriate.
Upon the receipt of any notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event
of the kind described in clause (iv) or (v) of this Section 5(m), Holders
shall forthwith discontinue any offer and disposition of Registrable
Securities pursuant to the registration statement covering such Registrable
Securities until all Holders shall have received copies of a supplemented or
amended prospectus which is no longer defective and, if so directed by the
Company, shall deliver to the Company, at the Companys expense, all copies
(other than permanent file copies) of the defective prospectus covering
such Registrable Securities which are then in the Holders possession. If the
Company shall provide any notice of the type referred to in the preceding
sentence, the period during which the registration statements are required to
be effective as set forth under Section 5(a) shall be extended by the number
of days from and including the date such notice is provided, to and including
the date when Holders shall have received copies of the corrected prospectus;
and

 

(n) Enter into such agreements and take such other appropriate actions as are
customary and reasonably necessary to expedite or facilitate the disposition
of such Registrable Securities (including, underwriting agreements in
customary form, and including provisions with respect to indemnification and
contribution in customary form and consistent with the provisions relating to
indemnification and contribution contained herein), and in that regard,
deliver to the Holders such documents and certificates (or book-entry
confirmations) as may be reasonably requested by any Holder of the Registrable
Securities being sold or, as applicable, the managing underwriters, to
evidence the Companys compliance with this Agreement including, without
limitation, using its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent
accountants to deliver to the Company (and to the Holders of Registrable
Securities being sold in any registration) an accountants comfort letter
substantially similar to that in scope delivered in an underwritten public
offering and covering audited and interim financial statements included in
the registration statement or, if such letter can not be obtained through the
exercise of the Companys commercially reasonable efforts, cause its
independent accountants to deliver to the Company (and to the Holders of
Registrable Securities being sold in any registration) a comfort letter based
on negotiated procedures providing comfort with respect to the Companys
financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the registration
statement at the highest level permitted to be given by such accountants
under the then applicable standards of the Association of Independent
Certified Accountants with respect to such registration statement. In
addition, the Company shall furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities
being included in any registration hereunder an opinion of counsel in
substance and scope customarily delivered to underwriters in public offerings.

 



-11-  ---|--- 

(a) If requested by the underwriters for any underwritten offering of
Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration hereunder, the Company will
enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement with
the underwriters for such offering, such agreement to contain such
representations and warranties by the Company and such other terms and
provisions as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements with
respect to secondary distributions, including, without limitation, customary
provisions relating to indemnities and contribution and the provision of
opinions of counsel and accountants letters.

(b) If any registration pursuant to Section 3 hereof shall involve, in whole
or in part, an underwritten offering, the Company may require Registrable
Securities requested to be registered pursuant to Section 3 to be included in
such underwriting on the same terms and conditions as shall be applicable to
the securities being sold through underwriters under such registration. In
such case, Holders, if requesting registration, shall be a party to any such
underwriting agreement. Such agreement shall contain such representations and
warranties by the Holders requesting registration and such other terms and
provisions as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements
with respect to secondary distributions, including, without limitation,
provisions relating to indemnities and contribution.

(c) In any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration
hereunder, Holders shall also enter into such additional or other agreements
as may be customary in such transactions, which agreements may contain, among
other provisions, such representations and warranties as the Company or the
underwriters of such offering may reasonably request (including, without
limitation, those concerning Holders their Registrable Securities, Holders
intended plan of distribution and any other information supplied by it to the
Company for use in such registration statement), and customary provisions
relating to indemnities and contribution.



   7. | OTHER RESTRICTIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. 
---|--- 

Each Investor hereby acknowledges the restrictions on the transfer of the
shares of Common Stock as set forth in the Merger Agreement and the
Stockholders Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, among the Company and
each of the Investors (the " _Stockholders Agreement_ "), and expressly
acknowledges and agrees that nothing herein shall be deemed to permit any
assignment, transfer or other disposition of Registrable Securities
in violation of the terms of the Merger Agreement or the Stockholders
Agreement.

 



-12-  ---|--- 

To the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions
necessary to comply with the filing requirements described in Rule 144(c)(1)
or any successor thereto so as to enable the Holders to sell Registrable
Securities without registration under the Securities Act. Upon the written
request of Holders, the Company will deliver a written statement as to whether
it has complied with the filing requirements under Rule 144(c)(1) or any
successor thereto and will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
Holders to remove any restrictive legends or stop orders contained on any
certificates (or book-entry confirmations) so as to facilitate a sale by the
Holders of such shares under Rule 144.



   9. | PREPARATION; REASONABLE INVESTIGATION; INFORMATION 
---|--- 

(a) In connection with the preparation and filing of each registration
statement registering Registrable Securities under the Securities Act pursuant
to this Agreement, (i) the Company will give the Holders and underwriters, if
any, and their respective counsel and accountants, drafts of such registration
statement for their review and comment prior to filing, and (ii) as a
condition precedent to including any Registrable Securities in any such
registration, the Company may require Holders to furnish the Company such
information regarding Holders and the distribution of such securities as the
Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing or as shall be
required by law or the SEC in connection with any registration.

(b) In connection with each registration and offering of Registrable
Securities to be sold by Holders, the Company will, in accordance with
customary practice, make available for inspection by representatives of the
underwriters and any counsel or accountant retained by such Holders or
underwriters all relevant financial and other records, pertinent corporate
documents and properties of the Company and cause appropriate officers,
managers and employees of the Company to supply all information reasonably
requested by any such representative, underwriter, counsel or accountant in
connection with their due diligence exercise.



   10. | INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION. 
---|--- 

(a) In the case of each offering of Registrable Securities made pursuant to
this Agreement, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, indemnify
and hold harmless Holders, their officers, directors and Affiliates, each
underwriter of Registrable Securities so offered and each Person, if any, who
controls any of the foregoing Persons within the meaning of the Securities Act
(" _Holders Indemnitees_ "), from and against any and all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, expenses and judgments, joint or several, to
which they or any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act arising
out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged 

 



-13-   untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement
(or in any preliminary or final prospectus included therein) relating to the
offering and sale of such Registrable Securities, or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, or in any document incorporated by reference therein, or
any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not be liable to any Holders Indemnitee in
any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement, or any omission, if such statement or omission shall have
been made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the
Company in writing by or on behalf of Holders specifically for use in the
preparation of the registration statement (or in any preliminary or final
prospectus included therein), or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto.
Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of Holders and shall survive the transfer
of such securities.

(b) In the case of each offering of Registrable Securities made pursuant to
this Agreement, each Holder shall, to the extent permitted by law, indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, its officers and Affiliates, and each Person,
if any, who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning of the Securities
Act and (if requested by the underwriters) each underwriter who participates
in the offering and each Person, if any, who controls any such underwriter
within the meaning of the Securities Act (the " _Company Indemnitees_ "), from
and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, expenses and
judgments, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject,
under the Securities Act arising out of or based upon, any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration
statement (or in any preliminary or final prospectus included therein)
relating to the offering and sale of such Registrable Securities or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the
extent that such untrue statement is contained in, or such fact is omitted
from, information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of
Holders specifically for use in the preparation of such registration statement
(or in any preliminary or final prospectus included therein). In no event
shall the liability of any selling Holder hereunder be greater in amount than
the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder upon the sale of
the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation.
Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Company and shall survive the
transfer of such securities.

(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be
instituted involving any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought
pursuant to this Section 10, such Person (the " _indemnified party_ ") shall

 



-14-   promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "
_indemnifying party_ ") in writing; _provided_ that the failure of any
indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
indemnifying party of its obligations provided for in Section 10(a) or (b),
except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by
such failure to give notice. In case any such proceeding shall be brought
against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with
any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and
shall pay as incurred the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel
related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party
shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred
the fees and expenses of one specified counsel retained by the indemnified
party in the event (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall
have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named
parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include
both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of
both parties by the same counsel, in the written opinion of such counsel,
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection
with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable
for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all
such indemnified parties. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any
settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) but if settled with such
consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying
party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or
liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party will
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which (A) does
not include as an unconditional term the giving by the claimant or plaintiff,
to the indemnified party, of a release from all liability in respect of such
claim or litigation or (B) involves the imposition of equitable remedies or
the imposition of any non-financial obligations on the indemnified party.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable in respect of any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred
to herein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in proportion as
is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of all parties in connection
with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of

 



-15-   a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the party and the parties relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 10(d) were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section
10(d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10(d), no Holder shall
be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the
amount by which the proceeds actually received by such Holder from the sale of
the Registrable Securities subject to the proceeding exceeds the amount of any
damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such
untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. The amount
paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred
to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or
defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
subsection (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation and no indemnifying party shall be required to contribute
any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the
securities were offered to the public by the indemnifying party exceeds the
amount of any damages which the indemnifying party has otherwise been required
to pay by reason of an untrue statement or omission.

(e) The indemnity provided for hereunder shall not inure to the benefit of
any indemnified party to the extent that such indemnified party failed to
comply with the applicable prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities
Act as then applicable to the person asserting the loss, claim, damage or
liability for which indemnity is sought.



   11. | EXPENSES. 
---|--- 

In connection with any registration under this Agreement, the Company shall
pay all Registration Expenses. Holders shall be responsible for all other
expenses incurred in connection with such registration, including all
underwriting and placement discounts and commissions, agency and placement
fees, brokers commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or
disposition of such Holders Registrable Securities. The Company shall be
responsible for the reasonable fees and disbursements of a single counsel to
the Holders in connection with any registration under this Agreement, which
counsel shall be selected by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities outstanding. The Company shall not be responsible for the fees and
expenses of any additional counsel, or any of the accountants, agents, or
experts retained by any Holder in connection with the sale of Registrable
Securities.

 



-16-  ---|--- 
 

If a Holder seeks to effectuate an in-kind distribution of all or part of its
shares to its direct or indirect equityholders, the Company will, subject to
applicable lockups, work with such Holder and the Companys transfer agent to
facilitate such in-kind distribution in the manner reasonably requested by
such Holder, including by providing the recipient of such in-
kind distribution with the rights contemplated by Section 2(h).



   13. | MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION. 
---|--- 
 

In the event the Company engages in a merger or consolidation in which the
shares of Common Stock are converted into securities of another company,
appropriate arrangements will be made so that the registration rights provided
under this Agreement continue to be provided to Holders by the issuer of such
securities. To the extent such new issuer, or any other company acquired by
the Company in a merger or consolidation, was bound by registration rights
obligations that would conflict with the provisions of this Agreement, the
Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to modify any such
"inherited" registration rights obligations so as not to interfere in any
material respects with the rights provided under this Agreement.



   14. | LIMITED LIABILITY. 
---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither the members,
general partners, limited partners or managing directors, or any directors or
officers of any members, general or limited partner, advisory director, nor
any future members, general partners, limited partners, advisory directors, or
managing directors, if any, of any Holder shall have any personal
liability for performance of any obligation of such Holder under this
Agreement in excess of the respective capital contributions of such members,
general partners, limited partners, advisory directors or managing directors
to such Holder.

 



   15. | NOTICES 
---|---

   16. | ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT. 
---|--- 

Other than with respect to the Merger Agreement and the Stockholders
Agreement, this Agreement represents the entire agreement and understanding
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes any and all prior oral and written agreements, arrangements and
understandings among the parties hereto with respect to such subject matter.
This Agreement may not be amended, altered or modified and no provision of
this Agreement may be waived or amended except by written instrument executed
by a holders of two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the Registrable Securities and
the Company.

 



-18-  ---|--- 

The paragraph headings contained in this Agreement are for general reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any manner the meaning, interpretation
or construction of the terms or other provisions of this Agreement.

 



   18. | APPLICABLE LAW. 
---|--- 

This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts to be made,
executed, delivered and performed wholly within such state and, in any case,
without regard to the conflicts of law principles of such state.



   19. | SEVERABILITY. 
---|--- 

If at any time subsequent to the date hereof, any provision of this Agreement
shall be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or
unenforceable, such provision shall be of no force and effect, but the
illegality or unenforceability of such provision shall have no effect upon
and shall not impair the enforceability of any other provision of this
Agreement.



   20. | EQUITABLE REMEDIES. 
---|--- 

The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that
any of the agreements and provisions of this Agreement were not performed
fully by the parties hereto in accordance with their specific terms or
conditions or were otherwise breached, and that money damages are an
inadequate remedy for breach of this Agreement because of the difficulty of
ascertaining and quantifying the amount of damage that will be suffered by the
parties hereto in the event that this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its terms or conditions or is otherwise breached. It is
accordingly hereby agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to restrain, enjoin and prevent breaches of this
Agreement by the other parties and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, such remedy being in addition to and not in lieu of, any other
rights and remedies to which the other parties are entitled to at law or in
equity.



   21. | NO WAIVER. 
---|--- 

The failure of any party at any time or times to require performance of any
provision hereof shall not affect the right at a later time to enforce the
same. No waiver by any party of any condition, and no breach of any provision,
term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed
to be construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or of
the breach of any other provision, term, covenant, representation or warranty
of this Agreement.

 



-19-  ---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute but
one and the same original instrument.

 



   23. | SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. 
---|--- 
 

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
successors and permitted assigns of each of the parties and shall inure to
the benefit of each Investor; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
shall be deemed to permit any assignment, transfer or other disposition of
Registrable Securities in violation of the terms of the Merger Agreement or
the Stockholders Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that without the
prior written consent of the Company, an Investor may assign, transfer or
delegate any of its rights, duties and obligations hereunder to one or more of
its Affiliates who receives Registrable Securities. The Company may not
assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto (other than by operation of merger or
consolidation and in accordance with Section 13). Any transfer or assignment
made other than as provided in the first sentence of this Section 23 shall be
null and void.



   24. | EFFECTIVE DATE; TERM 
---|--- 
 

This Agreement shall be effective as of the Closing Date, and if the Closing
Date shall not occur, then this Agreement shall be null and void _ab initio_.

the Shelf Registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that the termination date in
clause (b) shall be extended beyond such third anniversary by a number of days
equal to the days of any Shelf Suspension(s), any deferral or suspension
under Section 2(d) and any period covered by any stop order, injunction or
other similar order or requirement of the SEC relating to the Shelf
Registration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Investor may at any time
provide written notice to the Company of its irrevocable election to withdraw
from all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement. In such event,
from and after the date of such notice, such Investor shall no longer be bound
by any obligations, or be entitled to any benefits, under this Agreement
(other than those that have accrued prior to such date), and from and after
such time, securities held directly or indirectly by such Investor shall no
longer be deemed to be Registrable Securities hereunder.



   25. | MUTUAL DRAFTING; INTERPRETATION 
---|--- 

Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which
each such party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between
the parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this

 



-20-   Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision.

"4.1.3. Investor Designees shall comply with the provisions of the corporate
governance documents of the Board; the policies and procedures applicable to
all non-management directors of the Board from time to time in effect; and the
rules and regulations of the SEC and the exchange on which the Common Stock is
then listed. In the event an Investor Designee does not so comply at any time
when an Investor Designee is a member of the Board, then such Investor
Designee shall take such action as is necessary to promptly comply therewith
(if such failure to comply is curable) or promptly tender to the Board his or
her resignation from the Board. Nothing in this Section 4.1.3 shall affect the
rights of Hicks and Watermill under Section 4.2 hereof. Any Person shall sign
an Investor Designee Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as 
_Exhibit A_ prior to, and as a condition of, becoming an Investor Designee."

execution of this Investor Designee Agreement and as a condition to becoming
an Investor Designee, the undersigned has received and reviewed the
Stockholders Agreement, shall be deemed to be an Investor Designee and shall
be subject to and required to comply with the terms and provisions of Section
4.1.3 of the Stockholders Agreement. In connection therewith, the undersigned
agrees to submit a resignation to the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of
the Company if required pursuant to the terms of Section 4.1.3 of the
Stockholders Agreement.

The undersigned agrees that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the undersigned does not comply with the obligations herein and the Company
may not have an adequate remedy at law. It is accordingly agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce
the terms of this Agreement. This Investor Designee Agreement shall be
governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State
of Delaware.
