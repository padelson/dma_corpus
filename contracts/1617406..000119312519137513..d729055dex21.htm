<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The opinion set forth in this letter is based on relevant current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the

administrative rulings and practices of the Internal Revenue Service (the <B>&#147;</B><B><U>IRS</U></B><B>&#148;</B>), including its practices and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS except with respect to a
taxpayer that receives such a ruling, all as of the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are subject to change by the IRS, Congress and the courts (as applicable), which may or may not be retroactive in effect and which might result in
material modifications of our opinion. Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, or of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury Department in regulations
or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsel&#146;s professional judgment with respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such issue were to be litigated,
but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position asserted by the IRS. </P>

and at least 75% of the Company&#146;s gross income for any taxable year for which it seeks to qualify as a REIT must be derived from certain specified &#147;real estate&#148; sources, including qualifying rents from real property. The
Company&#146;s ability to comply with this requirement is entirely dependent on the Company acquiring and owning (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) on the relevant dates &#147;real estate assets&#148; with an aggregate value equal to, or in
excess of, 75% of its &#147;total assets&#148; and owning throughout the relevant taxable year assets that will produce sufficient &#147;real estate&#148; gross income to satisfy the 75% gross income test. Accordingly, the accuracy of our opinion is
entirely dependent on the Company&#146;s representations contained in the Management Representation Letter, regarding, among other things, its gross income and the value and composition of its assets during the taxable years beginning with its
taxable year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and ending on the Effective Time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our opinions set forth above do not foreclose the possibility that the

the Treasury Regulations thereunder (including proposed and temporary Treasury Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court decisions, applicable legislative history, and the administrative rulings and practices of the

These provisions and interpretations are subject to change by the IRS, Congress and the courts (as applicable), which may or may not be retroactive in effect and which might result in material modifications of our opinion. Our opinion does not
foreclose the possibility of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, or of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury Department in regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion
of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsel&#146;s professional judgment with respect to the merits of such issue, if such issue were to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and is not a guarantee that the
IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position asserted by the IRS. </P>

qualifications set forth herein, including, without limitation, the discussion in the next five paragraphs below, we are of the opinion that commencing with its taxable year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, Park has been organized and operated in
conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust (a &#147;<B>REIT</B>&#148;) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and Park&#146;s method of operation (as described in the Reviewed Documents and the
Management Representation Letters) should enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for the taxable year that includes the Effective Time and future taxable years. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Park&#146;s qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code depends upon the ability of Park to meet on an ongoing basis (through actual quarterly and
annual operating results, distribution levels, diversity of share ownership and otherwise) the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, and upon Park utilizing any and all available &#147;savings provisions&#148; (including the provisions
of Sections 856(c)(6), 856(c)(7), and 856(g) of the Code and the provision included in Section&nbsp;856(c)(4) of the Code (flush language) allowing for the disposal of assets within 30 days after the close of a calendar quarter, and all available
deficiency dividend procedures) available to Park under the Code in order to correct any violations of the applicable REIT qualification requirements of Sections 856 and 857 of the Code. Our opinion set forth in this letter does not foreclose the
possibility that Park may have to utilize one or more of these &#147;savings provisions&#148; in the future, which could require Park to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to maintain its REIT qualification.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accuracy of our opinion is entirely dependent on the representations contained in the Park Management Representation Letter regarding the value and
composition of the assets of Park, and the nature of its income derived therefrom. We have not undertaken at this time to review Park&#146;s compliance with the applicable REIT qualification requirements on a continuing basis, nor will we do so in
the future. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of Park&#146;s operations, the sources of its income, the nature of its assets, the level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity of its share ownership,
and/or changes in the actual or constructive ownership of Park and Hilton, which is intended to be an &#147;eligible independent contractor&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;856(d)(9) of the Code (an &#147;<B>Eligible Independent
Contractor</B>&#148;) with respect to Park for any given taxable year, should permit Park to satisfy the requirements under the Code for qualification and taxation as a REIT. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We note in particular that Hilton currently operates all of the hotels,&nbsp;that are owned by Park
immediately prior to the Effective Time except for the hotels that are managed by Park rather than a third-party hotel management company, consisting of the following four hotels: the Hilton Garden Inn LAX/El Segundo in El Segundo, California; the
Hampton Inn&nbsp;&amp; Suites Memphis&#151;Shady Grove in Memphis, Tennessee; the Hilton Suites Chicago/Oak Brook in Chicago, Illinois; and the Hilton Garden Inn Chicago/Oak Brook in Chicago, Illinois. A few of the hotels that are operated by Hilton
are owned by taxable REIT subsidiaries of Park. The remainder of the hotels that are operated by Hilton are owned by Park and are leased by Park to a TRS Lessee. Hilton is expected to continue to operate in the foreseeable future a very substantial
portion, if not all, of the hotels owned by Park and leased to a TRS Lessee. One of the requirements that must be satisfied for the rents that Park receives from a TRS Lessee with respect to a Lease to qualify as &#147;rents from real property&#148;
under Section&nbsp;856(d) of the Code (and thus for Park to satisfy the gross income tests applicable to REITs) is that Hilton must qualify as an Eligible Independent Contractor. An Eligible Independent Contractor means, with respect to a Hotel, an
&#147;independent contractor&#148; as defined in Section&nbsp;856(d)(3) of the Code (an &#147;<B>Independent Contractor</B>&#148;) from whom Park derives no income, who is adequately compensated, and, at the time the Independent Contractor enters
into a management agreement to operate the Hotel, is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating &#147;qualified lodging facilities&#148; as defined under Section&nbsp;856(d)(9)(D) of the Code for any person who is not a related person
with respect to Park or its TRS Lessees. For Hilton to qualify as an Independent Contractor with respect to Park, (i)&nbsp;Hilton cannot own, directly or indirectly, more than 35% of shares of Park&#146;s stock and (ii)&nbsp;not more than 35% of the
total combined voting power of Hilton&#146;s stock (or 35% of the total shares of all classes of its stock) can be owned, directly or indirectly, by one or more persons owning 35% or more of the shares of Park&#146;s stock, in each case, taking into
account certain constructive ownership rules set forth in Section&nbsp;318(a) of the Code (as modified by Section&nbsp;856(d)(5) of the Code) (collectively, the &#147;<B>35% Ownership Requirement</B>&#148;). For the period commencing on
January&nbsp;4, 2017: (i) Park and Hilton have only had common stock outstanding, and (ii)&nbsp;both Park Common Shares&nbsp;and the shares of common stock of Hilton (the &#147;<B>Hilton Common Shares</B>&#148;) have been and are currently regularly
traded on an established securities market. Thus, only persons who own, directly or indirectly (taking into account the constructive ownership rules), more than 5% of Park Common Shares and more than 5% of the Hilton Common Shares (the owner of such
amount of stock, a &#147;<B>5% Shareholder</B>&#148;) are taken into account as owning any of Park Common Shares or the Hilton Common Shares for purposes of applying the limitation in clause (ii)&nbsp;of the preceding sentence. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the Distribution, certain funds affiliated with Blackstone and affiliated entities that directly or indirectly owned, actually or constructively, the
Hilton Common Shares (the &#147;<B>Blackstone Entities</B>&#148;) were 5% Shareholders of Hilton and would not have satisfied the 35% Ownership Requirement. Immediately after the Distribution, but before January&nbsp;4, 2017, Blackstone undertook
certain steps (the &#147;<B>Blackstone Restructuring</B>&#148;) intended to reduce Park Common Shares and the Hilton Common Shares held the Blackstone Entities and Blackstone Investors that would be considered to be owned by 5% Shareholders for
purposes of the 35% Ownership Requirement, such that commencing at the time of completion of the Blackstone Restructuring, those persons treated as 5% Shareholders of Park or Hilton should not have caused and should not cause Park or Hilton to fail
the 35% Ownership Requirement. Moreover, on March&nbsp;15, 2017, certain entities affiliated with Blackstone and HNA engaged in a transaction that resulted in HNA acquiring approximately 25% of each of the Hilton Common Shares and Park Common Shares
(the &#147;<B>HNA Purchase Transaction</B>&#148;). The HNA Purchase Transaction had the effect of reducing the ownership of the Blackstone Entities in each of Hilton and Park, but required that HNA also be taken into account in applying the 35%
Ownership Requirement. Given the manner in which the rules work, the HNA Purchase Transaction actually increased, for purposes of the 35% Ownership Requirement, the Hilton Common Shares and Park Common Shares that are considered owned by persons
treated as 5% Shareholders. Effective March&nbsp;9, 2018, HNA sold all of its Park Common Shares. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Applying the tax ownership rules, including the constructive ownership rules, we believe that, after the
Distribution and the Blackstone Restructuring, and both before and after the HNA Purchase Transaction, (i)&nbsp;Hilton and/or one or more actual or constructive owners of 10% or more of the Hilton Common Shares should not be considered to own,
actually or constructively, more than 35% of Park Common Shares, and (ii)&nbsp;the Blackstone Entities that are 5% Shareholders with respect to Park Common Shares and the Hilton Common Shares, together with HNA following the HNA Purchase
Transaction, collectively should not be considered to own more than 35% of Park Common Shares and the Hilton Common Shares. Based on this conclusion and the statements in the Reviewed Documents and the Park Management Representation Letter, we
believe that, commencing January&nbsp;4, 2017, Hilton and its subsidiaries should qualify as Eligible Independent Contractors with respect to the TRS Lessees. However, because the tax ownership rules and constructive ownership rules are very complex
and there is no or limited authority on certain aspects of those rules that are relevant to Blackstone&#146;s ownership for purposes of the 35% Ownership Requirement, and because the Hilton Common Shares are publicly traded and are not subject to
restrictions on ownership and transfer similar to the restrictions on ownership and transfer applicable to Park Common Shares, there can be no assurance that Hilton in fact has satisfied or will satisfy the 35% Ownership Requirement. If Hilton has
not satisfied that requirement at all times since the Distribution or does not satisfy that requirement in the future, then Park may fail to qualify as a REIT. </P>
