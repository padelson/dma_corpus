irrevocably waiving any right to claim that the conditions to the Park
Parties obligations to consummate the Merger set forth in _Section_ __ _

by the Company at Closing of the certificate specified in _Section_ __ _
8.2(d)_ and the opinion specified in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_, provided that if

8.2(e)_ shall be deemed to have been satisfied) and (C) providing other
evidence reasonably requested by the Company evidencing that the Merger will
occur no later than the day following the date on which the earliest

Transactions and Disposition Property Assistance Efforts (or the inability to

the Park Parties under this Agreement (including the obligation to complete
the Merger and the payment of the Merger Consideration), (iv) the Specified

to result in an amount of Taxes being imposed on, or any adverse Tax
consequences to, any shareholder or other equity interest holder of the
Company (in such persons capacity as a shareholder or other equity interest
holder of the Company), or other material adverse consequences to the
shareholders or other equity interest holders of the Company as a whole, that
are incrementally greater or more adverse, as the case may be, than the Taxes
or other adverse consequences to such party in connection with the
consummation of this Agreement in the absence of such action taken pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

 

(d) Subject to the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, unless otherwise

ARTICLE III

 

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on_ _Ownership Interests_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Park Parties,
the Company or the holders of any of the following securities of Merger Sub or
the Company:

 

(a) _Merger Sub Equity Interests_. The membership interest of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain issued and outstanding as the membership interest of the Surviving
Entity, which shall be a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 

(b) _Conversion of Company Common Shares_. Each Company Common Share issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including the
Company Common Shares that become or are considered to be outstanding pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, but in all cases excluding the Excluded Shares) shall
be automatically converted into the right to receive from Parent (i) 0.628
(as the same may be adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(d)_) (the
"Exchange Ratio") of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
Park Common Stock (the "Common Stock Consideration"), together with cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Park Common Stock as specified in _Section_ __ _
3.7_ (the "Fractional Share Consideration"), and (ii) $11.00 (as the same may
be adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(d)_) in cash (the "Cash
Consideration" and, together with the Common Stock Consideration and the
Fractional Share Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"), in either case
without interest, but subject to deductions of any applicable withholding Tax
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.5_. From and after the Effective Time,
all such Company Common Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall

 



19

    

 automatically be cancelled and shall no longer exist, and each holder of a
certificate (a "Certificate") or book-entry share registered in the transfer
books of the Company (a "Book-Entry Share") that immediately prior to the
Effective Time evidenced Company Common Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Company Common Shares, except, in all cases, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration from Parent, without interest, in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_, together with the amounts, if any, payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(e)_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 7.22_, the
shares of Park Common Stock delivered by Parent as the Common Stock
Consideration shall be subject to the restrictions on ownership and transfer
set forth in the Park Charter.

 

(c) _Cancellation of Company Common Share_ _s_. Each Company Common Share
owned by the Company or any wholly-owned Company Subsidiary and each Company
Common Share owned by any of the Park Parties or any of their respective
wholly-owned Subsidiaries, in each case, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "Excluded Shares"), shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement,
if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the Company should split, combine or otherwise reclassify the
Company Common Shares, or make a dividend or other distribution in Company
Common Shares (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Shares), or engage in a reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other like change, then
(without limiting any other rights of the Park Parties hereunder), the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to provide
the holders of Company Common Shares the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such change. Without limiting the other provisions
of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, Park should split, combine or otherwise
reclassify the shares of Park Common Stock, or make a dividend or other
distribution in shares of Park Common Stock (including any dividend or other
distribution of securities convertible into Park Common Stock), or engage in a
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other like
change with respect to Park Common Stock, then the Merger Consideration shall
be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to provide the holders of
Company Common Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such change. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or Park to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms
of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.2 _Effect on Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Time-Based Share Awards and Company Performance
Share Awards_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each of the
outstanding Company Common Shares that is subject to a Company Time-Based
Share Award or a Company Performance Share Award shall automatically become
one hundred percent (100%) vested and all restrictions and forfeiture
conditions thereon shall lapse, contingent upon the consummation of the
Merger, and thereafter such Company Common Shares shall be considered
outstanding for

 



20

    

 all purposes of this Agreement and the holders thereof shall only have the
right to receive the Merger Consideration from Parent with respect to such
Company Common Shares pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_ (less required
withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.5_). In addition, on the Closing
Date, the Company shall pay each holder of a Company Performance Share Award
an amount in cash equal to all accrued and unpaid cash dividends in respect
of such award, in accordance with the restricted share award agreement
pursuant to which such award was granted (less required withholdings as
provided in  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_).

(b) _Company Equity Incentive Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
and the Park Parties agree that the Company shall, and shall be permitted
under this Agreement to, take all corporate action necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 3.2_.

 

Section 3.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the mailing of the proxy statement in
definitive form relating to the Company Shareholder Meeting and the delivery
of Park Common Stock in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy
Statement"), Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") for the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration, as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_. On or before the Effective Time, (i)
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, cash in immediately available
funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration and the
aggregate Fractional Share Consideration and (ii) Park shall cause to
be contributed to Parent, and Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Exchange Agent, an amount of shares of Park Common Stock in book-
entry form issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_ equal to the
aggregate Common Stock Consideration. Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time following
the Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions, if any, to which a
holder of Company Common Shares may be entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(e)_. Such Cash Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration, shares of
Park Common Stock in book-entry form, and amounts of any dividends or other
distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(e)_ are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "Exchange Fund".
The Exchange Fund shall be for the sole benefit of the holders of record of
Company Common Shares and the holders of Company Time-Based Share Awards and
Company Performance Share Awards. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration
and payment of any amounts payable in respect of any dividends or other
distributions on shares of Park Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.3(e)_ out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Share Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers of the Company Common Shares. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates (or Book-Entry Shares)
evidencing ownership of the Company Common Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such
shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. From and after the Effective
Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Exchange Agent,
Park, Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Companys transfer agent for any
reason shall be exchanged as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ with
respect to the Company Common Shares formerly evidenced thereby.

 



21

    

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon possible after the Effective Time (but, in
any event, no later than three (3) Business Days following the Effective
Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available
for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) that immediately prior
to the Effective Time evidenced outstanding Company Common Shares whose shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration from Parent
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_ (i) a letter of transmittal (a "Letter
of Transmittal") that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof), to the Exchange Agent, which Letter of Transmittal
shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree upon, and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of
Company Common Shares evidenced by such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) will be converted at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement, together with any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other
distributions on shares of Park Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 3.3(e)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Exchange Agent, or to such other agent or agents reasonably
satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) shall be entitled, after the Effective Time, to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration from Parent payable in
respect of the Company Common Shares previously evidenced by such Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this
_ARTICLE_ __ _ III_, plus any amounts that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Park
Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.3(e)_, to be mailed or
delivered by wire transfer, within two (2) Business Days following the
Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof), together with such Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and the Certificate (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith
cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_, each Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to evidence only the
right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration from Parent
as contemplated by this _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_. No interest shall be paid or
accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof).

 



22

    

(d) _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required
to deliver a Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration from Parent that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_. In lieu thereof,
each registered holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically
upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter),
the Merger Consideration from Parent in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.1(b)_. Payment of the Merger Consideration and distributions with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon the conversion of any Book-Entry Share.

 

(e) _Dividends With Respect to Park Common Stock_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Park Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) with respect to the shares of Park
Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other
distributions shall be paid by Park to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) with respect to the shares
of Park Common Stock issuable hereunder in accordance with this Agreement.
Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), there shall be paid to the holder thereof,
without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
shares of Park Common Stock and included in the Exchange Fund to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment
date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Park
Common Stock.

(f) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares_. At the Effective
Time, holders of Company Common Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no
rights as, shareholders of the Company other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration from Parent as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_,
together with any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other
distributions on shares of Park Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.3(e)_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) representing Company
Common Shares (or automatic conversion in the case of Book-Entry Shares) in
accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_ shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the
Company Common Shares theretofore evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares as of the twelve
(12) month anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any former holders of Company Common Shares prior to the
Merger who have not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent and only as general creditors thereof for
payment of the Merger Consideration.

 



23

    

(h) _No Liability_. None of the Park Parties, the Company, the Exchange Agent,
or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be
liable to any Person if any portion of the Exchange Fund has been delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such shares
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat
to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
any claims or interest of such holders or their successors, assigns or
personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

 

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
portion of the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) no such investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent or the
Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_,
(ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay
payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) such investments
shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with
maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments and the Exchange Fund diminishes below the level required to make
prompt payments of the Cash Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration
or any of the cash payments contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.3(e)_, Parent
shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, replace or restore, or cause to
be replaced or restored, the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through
investments so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times,
maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or other income produced by, such investments
shall be paid to Parent.

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, to the
extent required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person
of a bond in customary amount, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to this _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_ _._

 

Section 3.5 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parties, each of their
respective Representatives and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration (and any other
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or deemed paid for
Tax purposes), such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to such payments under the Code, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
Any such amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid over to
the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



24

    

Section 3.6 _Dissenters_ __ _ Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights,
or rights of objecting shareholders shall be available with respect to the
Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby, including any remedy
under Sections 3-201 _et seq_. of the MGCL.

Section 3.7 _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Park Common Stock shall be delivered by Parent, or
otherwise issued, upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Park.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Company
Common Shares (including the Company Common Shares that become or are
considered to be outstanding pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_) converted
into the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration from Parent pursuant
to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Park Common Stock from Parent shall receive from Parent, in lieu
thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of
a share of Park Common Stock multiplied by the VWAP of Park Common Stock.

Securities Act (the "Securities Laws"), together with all certifications
required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the
"Sarbanes-Oxley Act") (such documents, together with any documents and
information incorporated therein by reference, collectively, the "Company SEC
Reports"), all of which were prepared in all material respects in accordance
with the requirements of the Securities Laws. As of their respective dates,
the Company SEC Reports (other than preliminary materials) (i) complied (or
with respect to Company SEC Reports filed after the date hereof, will comply)
as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities
Laws and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) at the time of filing or being

statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, except to the extent such statements have been
modified or superseded by later Company SEC Reports filed or furnished and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement and provided that no
representation or warranty is made hereunder as to statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement to the
extent based upon information supplied to the Company by or on behalf of the
Park Parties. The Company has no outstanding and unresolved comments from the
SEC with respect to the Company SEC Reports. Each of the consolidated balance
sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Company SEC Reports
(including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of income,
operations, shareholders equity and cash flows of the Company included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company SEC Reports (including any related

income, operations, shareholders equity and cash flows, as the case may be,
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the periods set forth
therein, in each case in accordance with GAAP and the applicable rules,
accounting requirements and regulations of the SEC consistently applied during
the periods involved, except to the extent such financial statements have been
modified or superseded by later Company SEC Reports, and except, in the case
of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X

Act and for normal year-end audit adjustments which would not be material in

31

    

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement, including any contract
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company
and any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any
"off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K), where the result, purpose or effect of such contract is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary in the Companys audited financial
statements or other Company SEC Reports.

 

(c) There are no liabilities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary of a
nature that would be required under GAAP to be set forth on the financial
statements of the Company or the notes thereto, other than liabilities (i)
adequately provided for on the balance sheet of the Company dated as of
December 31, 2018 (including the notes thereto) as required by GAAP, (ii)
incurred under this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) incurred in the ordinary course of business,

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Since the end of the Companys most recent audited fiscal year, there
have been no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated). There
has been no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting
that has occurred since December 31, 2018 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. Since January 1, 2017, (x) the Company has designed and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to the Company and required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure, (y) to the Companys Knowledge, such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the Company to material information
relating to the Company required to be included in the reports the Company is
required to file under the Exchange Act, and (z) the Companys principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the
Companys independent registered public accounting firm and the audit
committee of the Company Board (A) all known significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (B) any known fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
As of the date of this Agreement, the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of the Company have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder, and the statements contained in all such certifications were, as
of their respective dates made, complete and correct in all material respects.

(e) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all current
listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.

Section 4.8 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
Action by any Governmental Authority or other Person pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any of the
Company Properties is subject to any outstanding order, writ, judgment,
injunction, stipulation, award or decree of any Governmental Authority that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.9 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as expressly contemplated in
this Agreement, from December 31, 2018 through the date hereof, (a) the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and (b) there has not been any Event that has had or would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.10 _Taxes_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (i) has timely filed all
Tax Returns required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing
extension granted by a Governmental Authority), and such Tax Returns are true,

Taxes required to be paid by it, other than material Taxes being contested in
good faith and for which adequate reserves have been established in the
Companys most recent financial statements contained in the Company SEC
Reports.

 

(b) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiary REITs, (i) for all taxable
years commencing with the taxable year ended, in the case of the Company,
December 31, 2010, and, in the case of RP Holdings Trust, December 31, 2011,
and, in the case of CHSP DC Holding Trust, December 31, 2011, in each case,
through December 31, 2018 has been subject to taxation as a "real estate
investment trust" (a "REIT") within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and
has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii) has
operated since December 31, 2018 to the date hereof, and intends to continue
to operate (including with regard to the REIT distribution requirements in the
taxable year that includes and/or ends on the Closing Date) until the Closing
(and with respect to each of the Company Subsidiary REITs, each applicable
Company Subsidiary REIT Liquidation Date), in such a manner as to permit it to
continue to qualify as a REIT for its taxable year that will end, in the case
of the Company, on the Closing Date and, in the case of each
Company Subsidiary REIT, on the Company Subsidiary REIT Liquidation Date, and
(iii) has not taken or omitted to take any action that would reasonably be
expected to result in a successful challenge by the IRS or any other
Governmental Authority to its status as a REIT, and to the Companys
Knowledge, no such challenge is pending or threatened in writing. For purposes
of this representation, the Company has not treated and is not treating either
of the Company Subsidiary REITs as "taxable REIT subsidiaries" within the
meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code (each a "Taxable REIT Subsidiary") of
the Company regardless of whether the Company together with a Company
Subsidiary REIT jointly filed an election on IRS Form 8875 to treat the
Company Subsidiary REIT as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary of the Company.

 



33

    

(c) The most recent financial statements contained in the Company SEC Reports
reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the
date of such financial statements in accordance with GAAP, whether or not
shown as being due on any Tax Returns.

(d) No deficiencies for any Taxes have been claimed, proposed, asserted or
assessed in writing against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
or to the Companys Knowledge, threatened, by any Governmental Authority,
which deficiencies have not been settled except for such deficiencies which
are being contested in good faith or with respect to which the failure to
pay, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (including but not limited
to the Company Subsidiary REITs) holds any asset the disposition of which
would be subject to Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-7, nor have they
disposed of any such asset during its current taxable year.

 

(f) No entity in which the Company directly or indirectly owns an interest is
or at any time since the later of its acquisition and its formation has been
a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, other than the Company
Subsidiary REITs, entities that qualify as "qualified REIT subsidiaries"
within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the Code (each a "Qualified REIT
Subsidiary") or a Taxable REIT Subsidiary of the Company. _Section_ __ _
4.10(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct and
complete list of each entity in which the Company directly or indirectly owns
an interest and the U.S. federal income tax status of such entity as a REIT,
Qualified REIT Subsidiary, Taxable REIT Subsidiary, or entity disregarded from
its owner.

 

(g) The Companys dividends paid deduction, within the meaning of Section 561
of the Code, for each taxable year commencing with Companys year ended
December 31, 2010 and through December 31, 2018, has not been less than the
sum of (x) the Companys REIT taxable income, as defined in Section 857(b)(2)
of the Code, determined without regard to any dividends paid deduction for
such year, and (y) the Companys net capital gain for such year. Each of the
Company Subsidiary REITs dividends paid deduction, within the meaning of
Section 561 of the Code, for each taxable year commencing with such entitys
first taxable year and through December 31, 2018, has not been less than the
sum of (x) such entitys REIT taxable income, as defined in Section 857(b)(2)
of the Code, determined without regard to any dividends paid dedication for
such year, and (y) such entitys net capital gain for such year. Taking into
account all distributions to be made by each Company Subsidiary REIT prior to
the applicable Company Subsidiary REIT Liquidation Date, each of the Company
Subsidiary REITs will have distributed cash to its respective shareholders in
its taxable year ending on the Company Subsidiary REIT Liquidation Date in an
amount equal to or in excess of the amount required to be distributed
pursuant to Section 857(a) of the Code in respect of its taxable year ending
on the applicable Company Subsidiary REIT Liquidation Date.

 



34

    

(h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary (other than a Taxable REIT
Subsidiary of the Company or a Taxable REIT Subsidiary of a Company
Subsidiary REIT) has engaged at any time in any "prohibited transactions"
within the meaning of Section 857(b)(6) of the Code. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary (including but not limited to the Company Subsidiary
REITs) has engaged in any transaction that would give rise to "redetermined
rents", "redetermined deductions", "excess interest" or "redetermined TRS
service income", in each case as defined in Section 857(b)(7) of the Code.

(i) (i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority or

where the Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns; (ii)
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has entered into any "closing
agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law); (iii) neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations
in respect of material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect

(such documents, together with any documents and information incorporated
therein by reference, collectively, the "Park SEC Reports"), all of which were
prepared in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of
the Securities Laws. As of their respective dates, the Park SEC Reports
(other than preliminary materials) (i) complied (or with respect to Park SEC
Reports filed after the date hereof, will comply) as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Laws and (ii) at the time of

superseded by later Park SEC Reports filed or furnished and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement and provided that no
representation or warranty is made hereunder as to statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement that were
not supplied by or on behalf of the Park Parties. Park does not have any
outstanding and unresolved comments from the SEC with respect to Park SEC

date and each of the consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and
cash flows of Park included in or incorporated by reference into Park SEC

as the case may be, of Park for the periods set forth therein, in each case in
accordance with GAAP and the applicable rules accounting requirements and
regulations of the SEC consistently applied during the periods
involved, except to the extent such financial statements have been modified
or superseded by later Park SEC Reports, and except, in the case of the
unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the
Exchange Act and pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and for

party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar
contract or arrangement, including any contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among Park or Parent, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate of Park or Parent, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any
"off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K), where the result, purpose or effect of such contract is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of
Park or any Park Subsidiary in Parks audited financial statements or other
Park SEC Reports.

(c) There are no liabilities of Park of a nature that would be required under
GAAP to be set forth on the financial statements of Park or the notes thereto,

procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by Park in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to Parks management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, (y) to
Parks Knowledge, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of Park to material information relating to Park required to be
included in the reports Park is required to file under the Exchange Act, and
(z) Parks principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
have disclosed to Parks independent registered public accounting firm and the

financial information, and (B) any known fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parks
internal control over financial reporting. As of the date of this Agreement,

other authorities (including the NYSE), subject to extensions permitted by Law
or applicable rules or regulations;

(ix) amend or propose to amend the Organizational Documents of Park in a
manner as would cause holders of Company Common Shares that will receive the
Common Stock Consideration in connection with the Merger to be treated in a
manner materially and disproportionately adverse to the manner that other
holders of Park Common Stock are treated;

(x) adopt a plan of merger, complete or partial liquidation, dissolution,
consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization of any
of the Park Parties or adopt resolutions providing for or authorizing such
merger, liquidation dissolution, consolidation,
restructuring, recapitalization or reorganization (other than the Merger), to
the extent that such merger, liquidation dissolution, consolidation,
restructuring, recapitalization or reorganization would prevent or materially
impair the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger on a timely basis;

(xi) knowingly take any action that would, or knowingly fail to take any
action, the failure of which to be taken would, reasonably be expected to
cause Park or the Park Subsidiary REIT to fail to qualify as a REIT; or

(xii) authorize, or enter into any contract, agreement, commitment or
arrangement to take any of the foregoing actions.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Park, Parent or the board of
directors of the Park Subsidiary REIT from taking any action, at any time or
from time to time, that in the reasonable judgment of the Park Board or the
members of Parent, as applicable, upon advice of outside counsel to Park or
Parent, as applicable, is necessary for Park or the Park Subsidiary REIT to
avoid or to continue to avoid incurring entity-level income or excise Taxes
under the Code or to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Code for
any period or portion thereof ending on

 



74

    

 or prior to the Effective Time, including making dividend or other
distribution payments in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.16(c)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.16(e)_ to stockholders of Park or the Park Subsidiary REIT,
as applicable, in accordance with this Agreement, or to qualify or preserve
the status of any Park Subsidiary (other than the Park Subsidiary REIT) as a
disregarded entity or partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes or as
a Qualified REIT Subsidiary or a Taxable REIT Subsidiary under the applicable
provisions of Section 856 of the Code, as the case may be. If Park determines
in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(c)_ that it is necessary to take
any such action in reliance on this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(c)_, which action the
Park Parties would otherwise be prohibited from taking without the consent of
the Company pursuant to this Agreement, then Park shall notify the Company as
soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 7.16(e)_, if applicable) prior to taking such action (but the Park
Parties shall not be required to obtain any consent from the Company with
respect to such action).

Section 6.3 _No Control of Other Party_ __ _s Business_. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct Parks, Parents, Merger Subs or any other Park
Subsidiarys operations prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give any Park Party, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Company or any Company Subsidiarys operations prior
to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

Section 7.1 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement; Company
Shareholder Meeting; Listing Application_.

(a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and deliver
to Park, for inclusion in the Form S-4 to be filed by Park with the SEC, the
Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement or such earlier date as is reasonably practicable. Park shall
use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4,
in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement. Each of the
Company and Park shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Form
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, (B) ensure that the Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Exchange Act and Securities Act, and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective for
so long as necessary to complete the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Park shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the

with the Merger accepted by the NYSE as promptly as is practicable following
submission. Each of the Company and Park shall furnish to the other Party any
and all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its
shares of beneficial interest or capital stock, as the case may be, and
provide such other assistance as may be required or reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and
the Proxy Statement and the preparation and filing of the NYSE listing
application. The Parties shall notify

 



75

    

 each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the NYSE
and of any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form
S-4 or Proxy Statement or from the NYSE for amendments of supplements to the
NYSE listing application or for additional information. Each Party shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, (I) provide the other Parties
with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC or the NYSE, on the other hand, and all written
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 received from
the SEC or with respect to the NYSE listing application received from the
NYSE, and (II) advise the other Parties of any oral comments with respect to
the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 received from the SEC or with respect to
the NYSE listing application received from the NYSE. Each of the Company and
Park shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement, and Park shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments from the NYSE with respect to the NYSE
listing application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to (1) filing the
Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, or (2) submitting the NYSE listing
application to the NYSE or responding to any comments of the NYSE, the
Company and Park shall cooperate and provide the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the
proposed final version of such document or response) and shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments thereon made by the
other Party or its counsel and, with respect to clause (1) above, the Company
and Park also shall have consented to the filing contemplated therein (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Park
shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof (x) of the
time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order
relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the Park Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and Park shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such
stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated and (y) of
the time the NYSE listing application is accepted. Park shall take any other
action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, NYSE
rules and regulations, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue
sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the
issuance of the Park Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall
furnish to Park all information concerning the Company and the Companys
shareholders as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
actions.

 

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Park, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Park that, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Park, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Form S-4 and/or the Proxy Statement, so
that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties,
and the Company and Park shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of
any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the Form
S-4 and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to the shareholders of the Company.
Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any
Party under _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_.

 



76

    

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company
Governing Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Companys shareholders for the purpose of
seeking the Company Shareholder Approval (together with any adjournments or
postponements thereof, the "Company Shareholder Meeting"). The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the shareholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company Shareholder
Meeting. The Company Recommendation shall be included in the Proxy Statement
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the Company
Shareholder Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act and obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval, except to the extent the Company Board shall have made a Change in
Company Recommendation as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(iv)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_, if,
on a date for which the Company Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company
has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Company Common
Shares to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is
present, the Company may make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Company Shareholder Meeting solely for the purpose of and
for the times reasonably necessary to solicit additional proxies and votes in
favor of the Merger; _provided_ that the Company Shareholder Meeting shall not
be postponed or adjourned to a date that is (i) more than thirty (30) days
after the date for which the Company Shareholder Meeting was originally
scheduled (excluding any postponement or adjournments required by applicable
Law) without the consent of Park, (ii) more than one-hundred twenty (120) days
from the record date for the Company Shareholder Meeting or (iii) later than
two (2) Business Days prior to the Outside Date.

 

(d) Without the prior written consent of Park (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), adoption of this Agreement and approval of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby is the only matter,
other than any say-on-golden parachute vote that may be required pursuant to
Section 14A(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c) thereunder and one or
more proposals to approve the adjournment of the Company Shareholder Meeting,
if necessary, to solicit additional proxies, in the event there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting to obtain the
approval of the Companys shareholders, which the Company shall propose to be
acted on by its shareholders at the Company Shareholder Meeting.

Section 7.2 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including _Section_ __ _ 7.3_), each of the Company and the Park Parties
shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the other Park
Subsidiaries, respectively, and their respective Affiliates to, use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with each other in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to
any contract or agreement to consummate and make effective, as promptly as
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) the taking of all reasonable actions necessary to
cause the conditions to Closing set forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ VIII_ to be
satisfied, (ii) the 

 



77

    

 obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Authorities necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or
to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other
Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 7.9(c)_, the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed
so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and (iv)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall
the Park Parties, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates be required to agree to, enter into, or offer to enter into any
agreement or consent order requiring divestiture of any assets, hold-
separate, business limitation, conduct remedy, or similar arrangement or
undertaking in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the other may request in connection with the preparation of any required
governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any
inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including promptly informing the other
Party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations
or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each other with
copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between
either Party and any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement.
To the extent reasonably practicable and permitted by a Governmental
Authority, the Parties or their Representatives shall have the right to review
in advance and each of the Parties will consult the others on, all the
information relating to the other and each of their Affiliates that appears in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except that confidential competitively
sensitive business information may be redacted from such exchanges. The
Parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any sensitive
materials provided to the other under this  _Section 7.2_ as "outside
counsel only". Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by
such outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or trustees of the
recipient without the advance written consent of the Party providing such
materials. To the extent reasonably practicable, no Party shall, nor shall a
Party permit its Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting
or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other
Party prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, without giving the other Party the opportunity
to attend or participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such
meeting with such Governmental Authority.

 



78

    

(c) In addition to and without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parties
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable
best efforts to give any notices to Third Parties, and each of the Parties
shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any Third Party consents not covered by
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ that are necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, obtaining any approval or
consent from any Third Party pursuant to this _Section 7.2(c)_ shall not be
considered a condition to the obligations of Park to consummate the Merger.

 

Section 7.3 _Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Recommendation_.

 

(a) Except as expressly provided by this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, from and after
the date hereof, the Company shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective officers, trustees and directors not to, and shall
instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist (including by
way of furnishing non-public information), any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any nonpublic information
or data to any Person (other than Park or its Representatives), or afford to
any other Person (other than Park or its Representatives) access to the
business, properties, assets or personnel of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, in each case, in connection with, or for the purpose of
knowingly encouraging, facilitating or assisting, an Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry, (iii) terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any,
or take any other action having a similar effect with respect to, any
standstill provision or similar obligation or any Takeover Statute; _provided_
, that the Company shall be permitted to grant waivers of, and not enforce,
any such standstill provision or similar obligation in effect on the date
hereof solely to the extent necessary to permit the counterparty thereto to
make an Acquisition Proposal in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_,
or (iv) approve, authorize, execute or enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share
exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar Contract (whether
written or oral) providing for any Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _7.3(b)_ ) or
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger
(any such letter, memorandum, agreement or other Contract, an "Acquisition
Agreement") or (v) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(b) (i) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ to the contrary,
the Company shall be permitted to, and shall be permitted to authorize the
Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, take the
following actions, prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal by
such Person made after the date of this Agreement ( _provided_ that (x) the
Acquisition Proposal by such Person did not result from a breach or violation
of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and (y) the Company and the Company Board may
inquire with a Person making any such Acquisition Proposal solely to request
clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether
such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal) and which the Company Board
determines in good faith (after

 



79

    

 consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors)
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal,
if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
trustees duties under applicable Law: (A) engage in discussions and
negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal with the Person who made
such Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons Representatives) and (B) provide
any nonpublic information or data to the Person who made such Acquisition
Proposal (and such Persons Representatives) after entering into
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person; provided, however,
that, prior to taking any of the actions described in the immediately
preceding clause (A) and clause (B), the Company must comply with its
obligations under the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(ii)_ with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal and must notify Park that it intends to
take such action with respect to such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
provide Park with a copy of any nonpublic information or data provided to the
Person who made such Acquisition Proposal prior to or simultaneously with
furnishing such information to such Person to the extent such nonpublic
information or data has not been previously provided to Park. For purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_, an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means
a customary confidentiality agreement between the Company, on the one hand,
and a counterparty, on the other hand, having confidentiality and use
provisions that are not less favorable in any material respect to the Company
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to Park;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
is not required to contain any "standstill" or similar provisions or otherwise
prohibit the making, or amendment, of any Acquisition Proposal and may contain
provisions that permit the Company and the Park Parties to comply with the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_. The Company shall not enter into any
agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Inquiry that
prohibits such Person from providing information to the Park Parties in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_.

 

(ii) The Company shall as promptly as practical (but in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours after the receipt thereof) notify Park orally, and
promptly thereafter in writing, of the receipt by the Company, the Company
Board or any of their respective Representatives of any Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry. Such notice shall (A) identify the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, (B) indicate the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and
(C) include a copy thereof (if in writing) and any material documentation or
correspondence that sets forth any such terms. The Company shall as promptly
as practical (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after the
execution thereof) provide Park a copy of any executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_.
The Company shall (x) promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Park, orally and promptly thereafter in writing, of any changes
or modifications to the material terms of the Acquisition Proposal and (y)
keep Park informed on a reasonably current basis regarding material
developments, discussions and negotiations concerning any such Acquisition
Proposal, and upon the reasonable request of Park shall apprise Park of the
status of such Acquisition Proposal.

 



80

    

(iii) Except as expressly provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(iv)_,
the Company Board shall not (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify
the Company Recommendation in any manner adverse to the Park Parties, (B)
adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, (C) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (D) fail to recommend against any
Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer subject to
Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange Act (including, for these
purposes, by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer by the Companys shareholders) within ten (10)
Business Days after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer,
(E) if an Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acquisition Proposal in the
circumstances described in clause (D) above) or any material modification
thereof is made public or is otherwise sent to the holders of Company Common
Shares or if a Third Party makes a public statement stating such Third Partys
intention to make an Acquisition Proposal, fail to issue a press release or
other public communication that reaffirms the Company Recommendation within
ten (10) Business Days (or if the Company Shareholder Meeting is scheduled to
be held within ten (10) Business Days form the date of such announcement,
promptly and in any event prior to the date on which the Company
Shareholder Meeting is scheduled to be held) after Park so requests in
writing, (F) propose, resolve or agree to take any action set forth in the
foregoing clauses (A) through (E) (any such action set forth in the foregoing
clauses (A) through (F), a "Change in Company Recommendation") or (G)
authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Affiliates to enter into
any Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_).

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board
may (i) make a Change in Company Recommendation and terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_ if (A) an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that the Acquisition Proposal did not result
from a breach or violation of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_) is made to the
Company and is not withdrawn, (B) the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
(C) the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the trustees duties under applicable Law, or (ii) make a
Company Change in Recommendation, not in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal, if (A) an Intervening Event has occurred and (B) the Company Board
has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
trustees duties under applicable Law; so long as, in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii) (x) four (4) Business Days (the "Notice Period") shall
have elapsed since the Company has given written notice to Park advising Park
that the Company intends to make a Change in Company Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event (each, a "Company
Change Notice") and which Company Change Notice shall specify (I) in a case
where the Company Change Notice relates to a Superior Proposal, the identity
of the Person who made the Acquisition Proposal, the reasons for the Change in
Company Recommendation (specified in reasonable detail) and all material
terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (and including therewith
copies of all material and relevant documents and agreements relating to the
proposed Acquisition Agreement), and (II) in a case where such Company Change
Notice relates to an Intervening Event, a description of such Intervening
Event (specified in reasonable detail), (y) the Company shall have negotiated,
and shall have caused its

  



81

    

 Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Park during such Notice
Period, to the extent Park wishes to negotiate, for an adjustment or
modification to the terms of this Agreement and (z) the Company Board,
following such Notice Period, shall have again determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors and
taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by Park during any applicable Notice Period)
that, (I) in circumstances involving or relating to a Superior Proposal, the
failure to make such Change in Company Recommendation would be inconsistent
with the trustees duties under applicable Law and that such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (II) in circumstances
involving or relating to an Intervening Event, the failure to make such Change
in Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with the trustees duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , (i) with respect to
circumstances involving or relating to a Superior Proposal, if, during the
Notice Period, any material revisions are made to the terms of such Superior
Proposal (it being understood that a material revision shall include any
change in the purchase price or form of consideration in such Superior
Proposal), each such material revision shall require a new Company Change
Notice and the Company Board shall, in each case, give a new Company Change
Notice to Park prior to the expiration of the then-applicable Notice Period
and shall comply in all respects with the requirements of this  _Section_ __
_ 7.3(b)(iv)_ and the Notice Period shall thereafter expire on the third
(3rd) Business Day immediately following the date of the delivery of such new
Company Change Notice ( _provided_ that the delivery of a new Company Change
Notice shall in no event shorten the four (4) Business Day duration applicable
to the initial Notice Period), (ii) in the event the Company Board does not
determine in accordance with the preceding clause (z)(I) that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, but thereafter determines to make
a Change in Company Recommendation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ with
respect to another Acquisition Proposal (whether from the same or different
Person), the foregoing procedures referred to in this _Section_ __ _
7.3(b)(iv)_ shall apply anew; and (iii) in the event the Company Board does
not make a Change in Company Recommendation in accordance with the preceding
clause (z)(II), but thereafter determines to make a Change in Company
Recommendation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ in circumstances
involving or relating to another Intervening Event, the foregoing procedures
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(iv)_ shall apply anew.

(v) Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall prohibit the
Company from (A) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
from making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (B) issuing a "stop, look
and listen" statement to the Companys shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position
thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the disclosure therein does not in
and of itself constitute a Change in Company Recommendation. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Company Board may not make a Change in Company Recommendation
unless in compliance with  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(iv)_.

(c) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company agrees that it will and will
cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and will instruct and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, (i) cease
immediately and terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Third Parties conducted heretofore that constitute or
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
terminate any

 



82

    

 such Third Partys access to any physical or electronic data rooms with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal and (iii) request that any such Third Party
and its Representatives promptly (A) destroy or return all confidential
information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries furnished by or
on behalf of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and (B) destroy
all analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that
contain, reflect or analyze such confidential information, in the case of the
foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), to the extent required by and in accordance
with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement between the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and such Person.

(d) Notwithstanding any Change in Company Recommendation, unless such Change
in Company Recommendation is with respect to a Superior Proposal and this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_, the Company shall
cause the approval of the Merger to be submitted to a vote of its
shareholders at the Company Shareholder Meeting.

(e) The Company agrees that it will promptly instruct its and the Company
Subsidiaries respective Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_. Any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ by any officer, director, trustee or other
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be
a breach or violation of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ by the Company for purposes
of this Agreement.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) "Acquisition Inquiry" means an inquiry, indication of interest, request
for information, discussion, proposal or offer from a Third Party that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal.

(ii) "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal, offer or inquiry from any
Person or "group" (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the

Section 7.4 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification_ _and
Insurance_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, (i) Park and
the Surviving Entity shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless
each person who is at the date hereof, was previously, or is during any of the
period from the date hereof until the Effective Time, serving as a manager,
director, officer, trustee or fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and acting in such capacity (collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law as
now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim with respect to
matters occurring on or before the Effective Time and any Losses, Claim
Expenses and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments
and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any
thereof) relating to or resulting from such Claim; and (ii) Park shall cause
the Surviving Entity to promptly pay on behalf of or advance to each of the
Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Claim Expenses incurred in
defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating
with respect to any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim,
including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any
Claim Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing
any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each
case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but subject to
Parks and the Surviving Entitys receipt of (A) an undertaking by or on
behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is
ultimately determined under applicable Laws or any of the Company Governing
Documents that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified and
(B) a good faith affirmation by such Indemnified Party of such Indemnified
Partys compliance with the standard of conduct required herein; _provided_
that none of Park, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective Affiliates
shall be liable for any amounts paid in settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld
or delayed), as applicable, and shall not be obligated to pay the fees and
expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable
Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with
respect to any single Claim except to the extent the Indemnified Party is
advised by counsel that such Indemnified Party has conflicting interests with
one or more other Indemnified Parties in the outcome of such action (in which
event such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to engage separate counsel, the
fees and expenses for which the Surviving Entity shall be liable). The
Surviving Entity shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any actual or threatened Claim in respect of which indemnification
has been sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement,
compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Claim, or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents thereto.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Park agrees that all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company Governing Documents, the
Organizational Documents of each Company Subsidiary and any indemnification
agreement set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (the "Indemnification Agreements"), in each case, as in effect as of
immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective 

 



85

    

 Time, (i) Park shall cause the Surviving Entity to honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Surviving Entity to the Indemnified Parties
under the Company Governing Documents, the Organizational Documents of each
Company Subsidiary and any Indemnification Agreements and (ii) the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity shall contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification and limitations on liability
of trustees and officers than are set forth in the Company Governing Documents
and the Organizational Documents of each Company Subsidiary, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or modified with respect to acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for a period of six (6)
years following the Effective Time in a manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification shall
be required by applicable Law and then only to the minimum extent required by
applicable Law.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premium for, and Park shall cause to be maintained in full force and effect
(and the obligations under to be honored), during the six (6)-year period
beginning on the date of the Effective Time, a "tail" prepaid
insurance policy or policies (which policy or policies by their respective
express terms shall survive the Merger) from the Companys current insurance
carrier or an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier, of at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries existing policy or policies, for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with
respect to directors and officers liability, employment practices liability
and errors and omissions liability insurance for Claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall the aggregate premium payable for such "tail"
insurance policy or policies for its or their entire period exceed an amount
equal to 300% of the most recent aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company
prior to the date of this Agreement for such insurance (such amount being the
"Maximum Premium"). If the Company is unable to obtain the "tail" insurance
described in the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_ for an amount
equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the Company shall be entitled to
obtain as much comparable "tail" insurance as reasonably available for an
aggregate cost equal to the Maximum Premium.

(d) If the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Entity shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_.

(e) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ are intended to be for the
express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party (who
are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_),
his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Park, the Company and the Surviving Entity and
shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Party
(including his or her successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (including the successors, assigns
and heirs) affected thereby.

Section 7.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
contracts, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
afford to the other Party and to the Representatives of such other Party
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice to all of their respective properties, offices, books, contracts,
personnel and records and, during such period, each of the Company and Park
shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Park Subsidiaries,
respectively, to, (i) furnish to the other Party all other information
(financial or otherwise) concerning its business, properties, offices, books,
contracts, records and personnel as such other Party may from time to time
reasonably request, (ii) furnish reasonably promptly to the other Party a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by
it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities Laws, except to the extent such materials are otherwise publicly
available, and (iii) with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and subject to the terms of the Company Ground Leases and the Company Leases,
facilitate reasonable access for Parent and its authorized Representatives
during normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance notice, to all
Company Properties in order to prepare or cause to be prepared (at Parents
sole expense) surveys, inspections, engineering studies, Phase I environmental
site assessments or other environmental assessments that do not
involve invasive testing or sampling of soil, groundwater, indoor air or
other environmental media, and other tests, examinations or studies with
respect to any Company Property that Parent deems to be reasonably necessary,
so long as such access does not unduly interfere with the Companys ordinary
conduct of business; _provided_ , _however_ that Parent shall indemnify the
Company for any losses, costs or damages caused by the access described in
clause (iii) of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5(a)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that
no investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ shall affect or be
deemed to modify any of the representations or warranties made by the
Company or the Park Parties, as applicable, hereto and all such access shall
be coordinated through the Company or Park, as applicable, or its respective
designated Representatives, in accordance with such reasonable procedures as
they may establish. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor
the Park Parties shall be required by this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ to provide the
other Party or the Representatives of such other Party with access to or to
disclose information (A) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a Third Party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice (if the Company or Park, as
applicable, has used its reasonable best efforts to obtain permission or
consent of such Third Party to such disclosure), (B) the disclosure of which
would violate any Law or legal duty of the Party or any of its
Representatives (if the Company or Park, as applicable, has used its
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law or legal duty), or (C) that
is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege or would cause a risk of a loss of privilege to the disclosing Party
(if the Company or Park, as applicable, has used its reasonable best efforts
to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not
result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work product or other
legal privilege, including by means of entry into a customary joint defense
agreement that would alleviate the loss of such privilege). Each of the
Company and the Park Parties will use its reasonable best efforts to minimize
any disruption to the businesses of the other Party that may result from the
requests for access, data and information hereunder. Prior to the Effective

 



87

    

 Time, the Company and each of the Park Parties shall not, and shall cause
their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact or otherwise
communicate with parties with which the other Party has a business
relationship regarding the business of such other Party or this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of such
other Party not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __ _
7.5(a)_ shall be deemed to restrict a Party and its respective Representatives
and Affiliates from contacting such parties in pursuing its own business
activities (operating in the ordinary course)).

(b) Each of the Company and Park shall hold, and will cause its
respective Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information,
including any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, in
confidence to the extent required by and in accordance with, and will
otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall remain in full force and effect pursuant to the terms thereof
notwithstanding the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
termination of this Agreement.

 

(c) The Company shall cooperate and participate, as reasonably requested by
Park from time to time and to the extent consistent with applicable Law, in
Parks efforts to oversee the integration of the Parties operations in
connection with, and taking effect upon consummation of, the Merger, including
providing such reports on operational matters and participating on such
teams and committees as Park may reasonably request.

Section 7.6 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to a Change in
Company Recommendation or other action permitted to be taken by the Company or
the Company Board pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 7.3_, so long
as this Agreement is in effect, the Parties shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements or
filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and, none of the Parties shall issue any such press
release or make any such public statement or filing prior to obtaining the
consent of the other Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, that a Party may,
without obtaining the prior consent of the other Parties, issue any such
press release or make any such public statement or filing as may be required
by Law, order or the applicable rules of any stock exchange or quotation
system if for any reason it is not reasonably practicable to consult with the
other Party before making any public statement with respect to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Park shall not be required to consult with or provide an
opportunity to review and comment to the Company in connection with any
prospectus, "road show" materials, press release, or other written materials
in connection with any issuance of Park Common Stock or other capital raising
initiatives so long as such statements are consistent in substance with
previous written press releases, written public disclosures or other written
statements made by the Park Parties and the Company in compliance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.6_ and not adverse to the consummation of the Merger. The
Parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the
Merger and the execution of this Agreement and shall make such joint press
release no later than one (1) __ Business Day following the date on which
this Agreement is signed.

Section 7.7 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing and ending on the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing (or if earlier, the date of the
employees termination of employment with Parent or any other Park Subsidiary
(including the Surviving Entity)), Parent shall, and shall cause each other
Park Subsidiary (including the Surviving Entity), as applicable, to,
provide each individual who is an employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing and who remains employed by Parent
or any other Park Subsidiary (including the Surviving Entity and any Company
Subsidiary) immediately following the Closing (each, a "Continuing Employee")
with (i) a base salary or base wages at an annual rate that is no less than
the annual rate of the base salary or base wages provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) a target annual cash
incentive opportunity that is no less than the target annual cash incentive
opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing, (iii) long term equity incentive compensation opportunity with a
value that is not less than any long term equity incentive compensation
opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee prior to the Closing and (iv)
benefits (including severance) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the benefits provided to the Continuing Employee by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Parties acknowledge that the
decision to provide an individual who is an employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing with employment
immediately following the Closing (or at any time thereafter) is within the
sole discretion of the Park Parties.

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the other Park Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Entity) to, provide credit for each Continuing Employees length of
service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (as well as service with
any predecessor employer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary) for
purposes of (i) eligibility to participate in (but not for purposes of any
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or other post-
retirement plan) and (ii) determining levels of vacation and paid time-off
under, each plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Park or the
other Park Subsidiaries (the "Park Plans"), to the same extent that such
service was recognized under a similar plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except that no such
prior service credit will be required or provided to the extent that (A) it
results in a duplication of benefits, or (B) such service was not recognized
under the corresponding Company Employee Program.

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Park Parties shall use, and
shall cause the Surviving Entity to use, reasonable best efforts to cause
each Park Plan in which any Continuing Employee participates after the Closing
that provides health or welfare benefits to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions, waiting periods and service conditions
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
Continuing Employees, other than limitations applicable under the
corresponding Company Employee Program or to the extent that such pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company
Employee Program and (ii) honor any payments, charges and expenses of
Continuing

 



89

    

 Employees (and their eligible dependents) that were applied toward the
deductible and out-of-pocket maximums under the corresponding Company
Employee Program in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket
maximums or co-payments under a corresponding Company Employee Program during
the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.

(d) Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall (i) confer any rights upon
any Person, including any Continuing Employee or former employee of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, other than the Parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii)
constitute or create an employment agreement or create any right in any
Continuing Employee or any other Person to any continued employment or service
with or for the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Park Parties or the
other Park Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Entity), or to any
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, (iii) constitute or
be treated as an amendment, modification, adoption, suspension or termination
of any employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Park Parties or the other Park
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Entity), or (iv) alter or limit the
ability of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Park Parties or the
other Park Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Entity) to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement at any
time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

Section 7.8 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall cooperate with Park in the preparation, execution and
filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and any similar taxes that become payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with any related
interests, penalties or additions to Tax, "Transfer Taxes"), and shall
cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes. Subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_, from and after the Effective Time, the Park Parties
shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding from any
consideration or amounts payable to holders of Company Common Shares, all
Transfer Taxes.

(b) Each of Park and Parent covenants and agrees that from and after the
Closing it will, or will cause its Affiliates, to take all actions, or
forbear from taking all actions, within its control, as necessary to ensure
that the Company and Park will be classified as a REIT for the taxable year of
such entity that includes the Closing Date, and will not knowingly take
or knowingly permit any of its Subsidiaries to take, within their control,
any action that is inconsistent with such REIT qualification. Park and the
Company shall cooperate to cause each Taxable REIT Subsidiary of the Company
to jointly elect with Park to be treated as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary of
Park, effective as of the Closing Date.

(c) On the Closing Date, prior to the Merger, the Company shall deliver to
Merger Sub a duly executed certificate of non-foreign status, dated as of the
Closing Date, substantially in the form of the sample certification set forth
in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B); _provided_ , _however_
, that in the event that any such certificate of non-foreign status is not
delivered to Merger Sub at or prior to the Merger, Parents remedy shall be
limited to withholding pursuant to this Agreement.

 



90

    

(d) The Park Parties and the Company shall, upon written request, use
reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any

Agreement, the failure by the Company or the Park Parties to provide such
prompt notice under _Section_ __ _ 7.9(a)_ or this  _Section_ __ _ 7.9(b)_

Section 7.16 _Dividends and Distributions_.

 

(a) In the event that a distribution with respect to the Company Common Shares
permitted under the terms of this Agreement (i) has a record date prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) has not been paid as of the Effective Time, such
distribution shall be paid by the Company on the Closing Date immediately
prior to the Effective Time to the holders of record of such Company Common
Shares as of such record date.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(ii)_ and  _Section_ __ _
6.2(b)(ii)_, during the Interim Period (i) the Company shall be permitted to
(A) authorize and pay quarterly distributions at a rate not in excess of $0.40
per share and (B) cause each Company Subsidiary REIT to authorize and pay any
dividends required by the terms of the preferred shares of such Company
Subsidiary REIT and (ii) Park shall be permitted to (A) authorize and pay
quarterly distributions at a rate not in excess of $0.45 per share and (B)
cause the Park Subsidiary REIT to authorize and pay any dividends required by
the terms of the preferred shares of the Park Subsidiary REIT. The Parties
shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that the timing of
any regular quarterly dividend paid by either the Company or Park prior to
the Closing will be coordinated so that, if either the holders of Company
Common Shares or the holders of Park Common Stock receive a distribution for a
particular quarter prior to the Closing Date, then the holders of Park Common
Stock and the holders of Company Common Shares, respectively, shall also
receive a distribution for such quarter prior to the Closing Date as necessary
to result in the holders of Company Common Shares and the holders of Park
Common Stock receiving dividends covering the same periods prior to the
Closing Date. The Parties will also coordinate such that any such quarterly
distributions by the Company and Park shall have the same record date and the
same payment date, which shall be consistent with Parks historical record
dates and payment dates unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, in order
to ensure that the shareholders of the Company and the stockholders of Park
receive the same number of such dividends prior to the Effective Time.

 



94

    

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company,
any Company Subsidiary (including but not limited to the Company Subsidiary
REITs), Park, and any Park Subsidiary (including but not limited to the Park
Subsidiary REIT), as applicable, shall be permitted (without the consent of
the other Party) to declare and pay a dividend to its shareholders and
stockholders, respectively, distributing any amounts determined by such Party
in good faith (in each case in consultation with the other Party) to be the
minimum dividend required to be distributed in order for each of the Company,
each Company Subsidiary REIT, Park and the Park Subsidiary REIT to maintain
its status as a REIT under the Code and to avoid the incurrence of any entity-
level income or excise Taxes by any of the Company, each Company Subsidiary
REIT, Park and the Park Subsidiary REIT under the Code (any dividend paid
pursuant to this paragraph, a "Permitted REIT Dividend"); _provided_ , that
with respect to Permitted REIT Dividends by the Company and each Company
Subsidiary REIT, the amount of the Permitted REIT Dividend shall be determined
as if the current taxable year of the Company ended with the Merger and
determined as if the current taxable year of each Company Subsidiary REIT
ended on the Company Subsidiary REIT Liquidation Date; _provided_ , _further_
, that in each case the calculation of such amounts shall be provided to
Parent for its review and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

(d) If the Company or a Company Subsidiary REIT, in consultation with Park,
determines that it is necessary to declare a Permitted REIT Dividend, the
Company shall notify the Park Parties at least twenty (20) days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in the event the Company declares a Permitted REIT Dividend
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.16(c)_, the Merger Consideration shall be
decreased by an amount equal to such Permitted REIT Dividend, which shall be
effected by reducing the Cash Consideration by an amount equal to the per
share amount of the Permitted REIT Dividend (it being understood that if the
amount of the Permitted REIT Dividend exceeds the amount of the Cash
Consideration, the Common Stock Consideration shall also be appropriately
reduced to reflect the full effect of the portion of the Permitted REIT
Dividend that exceeds the amount of the Cash Consideration). The record date
and payment date for any Permitted REIT Dividend payable by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary REIT pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.16(c)_ shall be the
close of business on the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

(e) If Park or a Park Subsidiary REIT, in consultation with the Company,
determines that it is necessary to declare a Permitted REIT Dividend, Park
shall notify the Company at least twenty (20) days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
the event Park declares a Permitted REIT Dividend pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.16(c)_ that would otherwise have a record date on or prior to the Closing
Date, the Merger Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to such
Permitted REIT Dividend, which shall be effected by increasing the Cash
Consideration by an amount equal to the product of (i) the per share amount of
the Permitted REIT Dividend and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. The record date and
payment date for any Permitted REIT Dividend payable by Park or any Park
Subsidiary REIT pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.16(c)_ shall be the close of
business on the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

securities of any of the Park Parties (including for use in preparation of
pro forma financial statements of any of the Park Parties); and (ii) __
requesting the Companys independent accountants to prepare and deliver
customary "comfort letters," dated the date of each final offering document

any such offering), in compliance with professional standards (including
providing "negative assurance" comfort and Statement on Auditing Standards No.
100 review of interim financial statements) and otherwise on terms reasonably
acceptable to the Park Parties, as the case may be; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that no failure by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to comply with the
foregoing shall give Parent or Park the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_, except to the extent that such
failure prevents the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger on a timely basis on or before the Outside Date; _provided_ _further_ ,
that none of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries shall be required to pay
any fee or incur any liability in connection with any such financing, and no
personal liability shall be imposed on any officers, trustees, directors or
other Representatives of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries. Nothing in
this _Section 7.17_ shall require cooperation contemplated hereby to the
extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.17_
shall require the Company to cause its legal counsel to deliver any legal
opinions. The Park Parties shall promptly, upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs

by them in connection with any such financing transaction or public offering,
any information utilized in connection therewith or any action taken by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.17_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing indemnity shall not apply

any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company or

  _Section_ _ 9.3_ ( _Termination Fee and Expense Amount_ ), _Section 9.4_
( _Payment of Expense Amount or Termination Fee_ ) and _ARTICLE X_ (
_General Provisions_ ) and the definitions of all defined terms appearing in
such sections shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as set forth in this 
_Section 9.2_, nothing shall relieve any Party from liabilities or damages
arising out of any fraud or willful and intentional conduct by such Party of
this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, all
filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant to this Agreement,
to the extent practicable, shall be withdrawn from the Governmental Authority

Section 9.3 _Termination Fee and Expense Amount_.

 

(a) If (i) (A) in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(b)(iii)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_, an Acquisition Proposal (whether or
not conditional) shall have been publicly made, proposed or communicated prior
to the termination of this Agreement or the Company Board has otherwise
received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, and, in each case, such
Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn prior to such termination, or (B)
in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_, an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) shall have been publicly
made, proposed or communicated prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting and
shall not have been publicly withdrawn prior to the Company Shareholder
Meeting, and (ii) following the occurrence of an event described in the
preceding clause (i), this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or
the Park Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _
9.1(b)(iii)_ or by the Park Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_, and
(iii) before the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of termination
of this Agreement, the Company enters into an Acquisition Agreement that is
later consummated or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated within twelve
(12) months after the date of termination of this Agreement (provided that,
for purposes of this clause (iii), the references to "20%" in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%"), then the
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Park Parties, subject to the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_, the Termination Fee by wire transfer of
same day funds to an account designated by the Park Parties, not later than
the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) the Company pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.1(e)_ or (ii) the Park Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(f)_,
then, in each case, the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Park
Parties, subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_, the
Termination Fee by wire transfer, of same day funds to an account designated
by the Park Parties concurrently with such termination (in the case of a
termination by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_) or within
five (5) Business Days after the date of such termination (in the case of a
termination by the Park Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(f)_).

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_, the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Parent the Expense Amount, by wire transfer to an account designated by
Parent, within five (5) Business Days after the date of such termination;
_provided_ , that the payment by the Company of the Expense Amount pursuant
to this _Section 9.3(c)_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent
obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ (but in
the event such Termination Fee is or becomes payable, it shall be reduced on
a dollar for dollar basis for the Expense Amount actually paid to Parent
pursuant to this _Section 9.3(c)_). In no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Expense Amount on more than one occasion.

 



103

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that:

(i) under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion; and

 

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the Company
is required to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_
or _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ and the Termination Fee is paid to the Park Parties
(or their designee), the payment of the Termination Fee will be the Park
Parties sole and exclusive remedy against the Company arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, except in the case of fraud or a willful and
intentional breach of this Agreement by any of the Company.

 

(e) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) neither the Termination Fee nor the
Expense Amount is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Park Parties in the circumstances in which
such fee or amount is due and payable for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which fee or amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the Park Parties
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails
to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ and, in
order to obtain such payment, the Park Parties commence a suit that results in
a judgment against the Company for the payment of any amount set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, such that the Company shall pay the Park Parties
its costs and expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on
such amount at the annual rate of the prime rate as published in _The
Wall Street Journal_ on the date of payment for the period from the date such
payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually
received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 9.4 _Payment of Expense Amount or Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event that the Company is obligated to pay the Park Parties the
Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to the Park
Parties from the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee deposited into escrow
in accordance with the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the
Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, and (ii) the sum of (A)
the maximum amount that can be paid to the Park Parties (or their designees)
without causing the Park Parties (or their designees) to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant
tax year, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A) through (H) or 856(c)(3)(A) through
(I) of the Code ("Qualifying Income"), as determined by Parks independent
certified public accountants, plus (B) in the event Parent receives either (1)
a letter from Parks counsel indicating that Park has received a ruling from
the IRS described in 

 



104

    

  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_ _(ii)_ or (2) an opinion from Parks outside
counsel as described in _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_ _(ii)_ , an amount equal
to the excess of the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable,
less the amount payable under clause (A) above. To secure the Companys
obligation to pay these amounts, the Company shall deposit into escrow an
amount in cash equal to the Expense Amount or the Termination Fee, as
applicable, with an escrow agent selected by the Company and on such terms
(subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company, the Park Parties and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into
escrow of the Expense Amount or the Termination Fee, as applicable, pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_ shall be made at the time the Company is
obligated to pay the Park Parties such amount pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.3_ by wire transfer or bank check.

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Expense Amount or the
Termination Fee, as applicable, in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be
released to the Park Parties (or their designees) unless the escrow agent
receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from Parks
independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that
can be paid by the escrow agent to the Park Parties (or their designees)
without causing the Park Parties (or their designees) to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if
the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a
subsequent letter from Parks accountants revising that amount, in which case
the escrow agent shall release such amount to the Park Parties (or their
designees), or (ii) a letter from Parks counsel indicating that Parent
received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by Parent (or its
designee) of the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable,
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or
alternatively, indicating that Parks outside counsel has rendered a legal
opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Park Parties (or their
designees) of the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable,
should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code),
in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Expense
Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, to the Park Parties (or
their designees). The Company agrees to not unreasonably withhold, delay or
condition its consent to amend this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_ at the request of
Park in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Expense Amount and/or
Termination Fee, as applicable, that may be distributed to the Park Parties
(or their designees) hereunder without causing the Park Parties (or their
designees) to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code, (y) improve Parks chances of securing a favorable ruling described
in this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_ or (z) assist Park in obtaining a favorable
legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this  _Section_ __ _
9.4(b)_. Park shall reimburse the Company for any reasonable, out-of-pocket
costs or expenses incurred by the Company in achieving such amendment. The
escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Expense Amount
and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, that remains unpaid as of the end of
the taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following
taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this _Section_ __ _
9.4_; _provided_ , that the obligation of the Company to pay the unpaid
portion of the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, shall
terminate on the December 31 following the date which is ten (10) years from
the date of this Agreement and any such unpaid portion shall be released by
the escrow agent to the Company. The Company shall not be a party to such
escrow agreement and shall not bear any cost of or have liability resulting
from the escrow agreement.

 



105

    

(c) Except at set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ and this  _Section_ __ _
9.4_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such
fees and expenses whether or not the Merger are consummated.

the Confidentiality Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
Parties, or between any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

 

Section 10.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to

to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except for the
provisions of ___ARTICLE III_ __(which, from and after the Effective Time,
shall be for the benefit of holders of Company Common Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time) and ___Section 7.4_ (which, from and after the
Effective Time shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties). The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of

Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to

 



107

    

 waiver by the Parties in accordance with ___Section 10.6_ without notice or
liability to any other person. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated
with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties.
Accordingly, persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Debt Financing Source shall be
an express and intended third party beneficiary of the Lender
Designated Sections and each of such Sections shall expressly inure to the
benefit of the Debt Financing Source and each Debt Financing Source (and its

to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or

is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or
future Law or public policy in any jurisdiction, as to that jurisdiction, (a)
such term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b) this Agreement
shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable term or other
provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party, and (d) such terms or other
provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms
or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced in any jurisdiction, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 10.8  _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of
actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise
out of or be related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in

its conflicts of laws principles (whether the State of Maryland or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland, except with respect to matters
under the DLLCA relating to the Merger, which shall be governed by the laws of
the State of Delaware.

 



108

    

Section 10.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each Party irrevocably agrees (a) to
submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction and forum of the Circuit Court for
Baltimore City (Maryland) (or, if that court does not have jurisdiction to the
United States District Court for the State of Maryland, Northern Division)
(the "Maryland Courts") for the purpose of any Action (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the actions of the Parties in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement of this Agreement, (b) to request and/or consent
to the assignment of any dispute arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the Parties in
the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement
to the Business and Technology Case Management Program of the Circuit Court
for Baltimore City (Maryland), (c) that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
such jurisdiction or forum by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (d) that it will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the Parties in
the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement
in any court other than the Maryland Courts, and (e) that a final judgment in
any Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the
Parties agrees, that service of process may be made within or outside the
State of Maryland, and agree that service of process on such Party at
the address referred to in _Section 10.2_ (or such other address as may be
specified in accordance with _Section 10.2_ ) by prepaid certified mail with a
proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service
constituting evidence of valid service shall be deemed effective service of
process. Service made pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall have the same
legal force and effect as if served upon such Party personally within the
State of Maryland.

 

Section 10.10 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages
(even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_, the Parties shall be entitled to
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such order or injunction. In no event shall the
exercise of any Partys right to seek specific performance pursuant to this
_Section 10.10_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the right of a Party to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_.

 



109

Party: (1) except for claims by the Park Parties against any Debt Financing
Source pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter (as defined below) and any
definitive documents related thereto, agrees that (A) none of the Parties nor
any of their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, managers, members or shareholders shall have any

herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise and (B) no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability
(whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any Party or any of their
respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or shareholders for any obligations or liabilities
of any Party under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and any such actions are disclaimed and released in full, and
(2)(i) agrees that it will not bring or support any Person in any Action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any of the parties providing financing to the Park
Parties pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter or their Affiliates (each such
Person, a "Debt Financing Source") in respect of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including, but not limited to any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the fully executed debt commitment letter (together
with any related fee letters), dated as of the date of this Agreement, by and
among the Debt Financing Sources and the Park Parties named therein providing
for debt financing as described therein (together, including all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and any joinders thereto or amendments thereof, the "Debt
Commitment Letter") or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New York State courts
located in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York; (ii) agrees that,
except as specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, all claims or
causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or

thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York; and (iii) hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation (whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in
any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby. Each Debt Financing Source is an intended
third party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 10.10(b)_ and shall be
entitled to the protections of this provision _._

amended with the mutual agreement of the Company and the Park Parties at any
time, whether before or after the Company Shareholder Approval has been

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

We have acted as REIT tax counsel to Chesapeake Lodging Trust, a Maryland real
estate investment trust (the " _Company_ "), in connection with the merger of
the Company into PK Domestic Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_REIT Merger Sub_ ") and a wholly owned subsidiary of PK Domestic Property
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Parent LLC_ ") and an
indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of Park Hotels and Resorts Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Park_ "), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of May 5, 2019, (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among Park, Parent
LLC, REIT Merger Sub, and the Company, and certain other transactions.
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in Section 8.2(e) of the Merger
Agreement, we have been asked to provide you with a legal opinion regarding
the qualification of the Company as a REIT as set forth below under the
caption titled "Opinion." All capitalized terms used but not defined herein
have the same meaning as used in the Merger Agreement.

Bases for Opinion

 

The opinion set forth in this letter is based on relevant current provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), Treasury
Regulations thereunder (including proposed and temporary Treasury
Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court
decisions, applicable legislative history, and the administrative rulings and
practices of the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "), including its
practices and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not
binding on the IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a
ruling, all as of the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are
subject to change by the IRS, Congress and the courts (as applicable), which
may or may not be retroactive in effect and which might result in material
modifications of our opinion. Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility
of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction,
or of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury Department in
regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of
counsel with respect to an issue represents counsels professional judgment
with respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such
issue were to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the
courts, and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary
position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a
position asserted by the IRS.

The opinion set forth in this letter is premised on, among other things, the
written representations of the Company, and, to the extent set forth in
the Management Representation Letter (as hereinafter defined), of the
Subsidiary REITs, contained in a letter to us dated as of the date hereof (the
" _Management Representation Letter_ "). Although we have discussed the
Management Representation Letter with the Company, for purposes of rendering
our opinion, we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the
facts set forth in the Reviewed Documents and the Management Representation
Letter. We consequently have relied upon the representations and statements
of the Company as described in the Reviewed Documents and the Management
Representation Letter (and, to the extent set forth in the Management
Representation Letter, of the Subsidiary REITs), and assumed that the
information presented in such documents or otherwise furnished to us is
accurate and complete in all material respects.

In this regard, we have assumed with your consent the following:



     | (1) |

that (A) all of the representations and statements as to factual matters set
forth in the Reviewed Documents and the Management Representation Letter are
true, correct, and complete as of the date hereof, (B) any representation or
statement in the Reviewed Documents and the Management Representation Letter
made as a belief or made "to the knowledge of" or similarly qualified is
true, correct and complete as of the date hereof, without such qualification,
(C) each agreement described in the Reviewed Documents is valid and binding in
accordance with its terms, and (D) each of the obligations of the Company,
and its subsidiaries, as described in the Reviewed Documents, has been or will
be performed or satisfied in accordance with its terms;

     | (2) |

the genuineness of all signatures, the proper execution of all documents, the
authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to
originals of documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of the
originals from which any copies were made;

duly executed without material changes from the form reviewed by us; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (4) |

that all Reviewed Documents have been duly authorized, executed, and delivered
by all parties thereto, each of the Reviewed Documents is enforceable against
the parties thereto in accordance with their respective terms, and all of the
parties to the Reviewed Documents timely perform their obligations thereunder; 

---|---|--- 
 

Any material variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the
documents that we have reviewed and upon which we have relied (including,
in particular, the Management Representation Letter) may adversely affect the
conclusions stated herein.

Opinion

 

Based upon and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth herein,
including, without limitation, the discussion set forth below, we are of
the opinion that:



     | (1) |

for each of the Companys taxable years beginning with its taxable year ended
December 31, 2010, through and including its taxable year ended December 31,
2018, the Company has been organized and has operated in conformity with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (2) |

for each of REIT IIs taxable years beginning with its taxable year ended
December 31, 2011, through and including its taxable year ended December 31,
2018, the Company has been organized and has operated in conformity with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (3) |

for each of RP Trusts taxable years beginning with its taxable year ended
December 31, 2011, through and including its taxable year ended December 31,
2018, RP Trust has been organized and has operated in conformity with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code; and 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (4) |

each of the Companys, REIT IIs, and RP Trusts organization and method of
operation enabled the Company, REIT II, and RP Trust, respectively, to meet
the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for
its taxable year ending, with respect to the Company, on the Effective Time
and with respect to the Subsidiary REITs, on the Company Subsidiary REIT
Liquidation Date, as applicable. 

---|---|--- 

In order to qualify as a REIT, 75% of the Companys total assets must be
comprised of "real estate assets" (as that term is used for purposes of Code
Section 856(c)) and limited other assets specified in the Code as of the close
of each calendar quarter of each taxable year of the Company, and at least
75% of the Companys gross income for any taxable year for which it seeks to
qualify as a REIT must be derived from certain specified "real estate"
sources, including qualifying rents from real property. The Companys ability
to comply with this requirement is entirely dependent on the Company acquiring
and owning (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) on the relevant dates "real
estate assets" with an aggregate value equal to, or in excess of, 75% of its
"total assets" and owning throughout the relevant taxable year assets that
will produce sufficient "real estate" gross income to satisfy the 75% gross
income test. Accordingly, the accuracy of our opinion is entirely dependent
on the Companys representations contained in the Management Representation
Letter, regarding, among other things, its gross income and the value and
composition of its assets during the taxable years beginning with its taxable
year ended December 31, 2010 and ending on the Effective Time.

Our opinions set forth above do not foreclose the possibility that
the Company, REIT II and RP Trust, as the case may be, may have to utilize
one or more "savings provisions" (including the provisions of Sections
856(c)(6), 856(c)(7), and 856(g)) through the Effective Time or the Company
Subsidiary REIT Liquidation Date, as applicable, which could require the
Company, REIT II or RP Trust, as applicable, to pay an excise or penalty tax
(which could be significant in amount) in order to maintain its REIT
qualification.

Re: Old Dominion

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

We have acted as tax counsel to Park Hotels and Resorts Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Park"), in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement"), by and among Park, PK
Domestic Property LLC, PK Domestic Sub LLC ("Merger Sub"), and Chesapeake

respect to the merger of Chesapeake with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub
surviving the merger, and certain other transactions. This opinion letter is

connection with the closing thereunder on the date hereof (the "Closing").
Capitalized terms used herein which are defined in the Agreement shall have
the meanings set forth in the Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein.

The opinion set forth in this letter is based on relevant current provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Treasury

may or may not be retroactive in effect and which might result in material
modifications of our opinion. Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility
of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction,

regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of

or that a court will not sustain such a position asserted by the IRS.

Opinion

Based upon and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth
herein, including, without limitation, the discussion in the next five
paragraphs below, we are of the opinion that commencing with its taxable year
ended December 31, 2017, Park has been organized and operated in conformity
with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate
investment trust (a "REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and Parks
method of operation (as described in the Reviewed Documents and
the Management Representation Letters) should enable it to continue to meet
the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for
the taxable year that includes the Effective Time and future taxable years.

 

Parks qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code depends upon the
ability of Park to meet on an ongoing basis (through actual quarterly
and annual operating results, distribution levels, diversity of share
ownership and otherwise) the various qualification tests imposed under the
Code, and upon Park utilizing any and all available "savings provisions"
(including the provisions of Sections 856(c)(6), 856(c)(7), and 856(g) of the
Code and the provision included in Section 856(c)(4) of the Code (flush
language) allowing for the disposal of assets within 30 days after the close
of a calendar quarter, and all available deficiency dividend procedures)
available to Park under the Code in order to correct any violations of the
applicable REIT qualification requirements of Sections 856 and 857 of the
Code. Our opinion set forth in this letter does not foreclose the possibility
that Park may have to utilize one or more of these "savings provisions" in the
future, which could require Park to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could
be significant in amount) in order to maintain its REIT qualification. 

The accuracy of our opinion is entirely dependent on the representations
contained in the Park Management Representation Letter regarding the value
and composition of the assets of Park, and the nature of its income derived
therefrom. We have not undertaken at this time to review Parks compliance
with the applicable REIT qualification requirements on a continuing basis, nor
will we do so in the future. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the
actual results of Parks operations, the sources of its income, the nature of
its assets, the level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity
of its share ownership, and/or changes in the actual or constructive
ownership of Park and Hilton, which is intended to be an "eligible independent
contractor" within the meaning of Section 856(d)(9) of the Code (an "Eligible
Independent Contractor") with respect to Park for any given taxable year,
should permit Park to satisfy the requirements under the Code for
qualification and taxation as a REIT.

We note in particular that Hilton currently operates all of the hotels, that
are owned by Park immediately prior to the Effective Time except for the
hotels that are managed by Park rather than a third-party hotel management
company, consisting of the following four hotels: the Hilton Garden Inn LAX/El
Segundo in El Segundo, California; the Hampton Inn and Suites MemphisShady
Grove in Memphis, Tennessee; the Hilton Suites Chicago/Oak Brook in Chicago,
Illinois; and the Hilton Garden Inn Chicago/Oak Brook in Chicago, Illinois. A
few of the hotels that are operated by Hilton are owned by taxable REIT
subsidiaries of Park. The remainder of the hotels that are operated by Hilton
are owned by Park and are leased by Park to a TRS Lessee. Hilton is expected
to continue to operate in the foreseeable future a very substantial portion,
if not all, of the hotels owned by Park and leased to a TRS Lessee. One of the
requirements that must be satisfied for the rents that Park receives from a
TRS Lessee with respect to a Lease to qualify as "rents from real
property" under Section 856(d) of the Code (and thus for Park to satisfy the
gross income tests applicable to REITs) is that Hilton must qualify as an
Eligible Independent Contractor. An Eligible Independent Contractor means,
with respect to a Hotel, an "independent contractor" as defined in Section
856(d)(3) of the Code (an "Independent Contractor") from whom Park derives no
income, who is adequately compensated, and, at the time the Independent
Contractor enters into a management agreement to operate the Hotel, is
actively engaged in the trade or business of operating "qualified lodging
facilities" as defined under Section 856(d)(9)(D) of the Code for any person
who is not a related person with respect to Park or its TRS Lessees. For
Hilton to qualify as an Independent Contractor with respect to Park, (i)
Hilton cannot own, directly or indirectly, more than 35% of shares of Parks
stock and (ii) not more than 35% of the total combined voting power of
Hiltons stock (or 35% of the total shares of all classes of its stock) can be
owned, directly or indirectly, by one or more persons owning 35% or more of
the shares of Parks stock, in each case, taking into account certain
constructive ownership rules set forth in Section 318(a) of the Code (as
modified by Section 856(d)(5) of the Code) (collectively, the "35% Ownership
Requirement"). For the period commencing on January 4, 2017: (i) Park and
Hilton have only had common stock outstanding, and (ii) both Park Common
Shares and the shares of common stock of Hilton (the "Hilton Common Shares")
have been and are currently regularly traded on an established securities
market. Thus, only persons who own, directly or indirectly (taking into
account the constructive ownership rules), more than 5% of Park Common Shares
and more than 5% of the Hilton Common Shares (the owner of such amount of
stock, a "5% Shareholder") are taken into account as owning any of Park Common
Shares or the Hilton Common Shares for purposes of applying the limitation in
clause (ii) of the preceding sentence.

 

Prior to the Distribution, certain funds affiliated with Blackstone and
affiliated entities that directly or indirectly owned, actually or
constructively, the Hilton Common Shares (the "Blackstone Entities") were 5%
Shareholders of Hilton and would not have satisfied the 35% Ownership
Requirement. Immediately after the Distribution, but before January 4, 2017,
Blackstone undertook certain steps (the "Blackstone Restructuring") intended
to reduce Park Common Shares and the Hilton Common Shares held the Blackstone
Entities and Blackstone Investors that would be considered to be owned by 5%
Shareholders for purposes of the 35% Ownership Requirement, such that
commencing at the time of completion of the Blackstone Restructuring, those
persons treated as 5% Shareholders of Park or Hilton should not have caused
and should not cause Park or Hilton to fail the 35% Ownership Requirement.
Moreover, on March 15, 2017, certain entities affiliated with Blackstone and
HNA engaged in a transaction that resulted in HNA acquiring approximately 25%
of each of the Hilton Common Shares and Park Common Shares (the "HNA Purchase
Transaction"). The HNA Purchase Transaction had the effect of reducing the
ownership of the Blackstone Entities in each of Hilton and Park, but required
that HNA also be taken into account in applying the 35% Ownership
Requirement. Given the manner in which the rules work, the HNA Purchase
Transaction actually increased, for purposes of the 35% Ownership Requirement,
the Hilton Common Shares and Park Common Shares that are considered owned by
persons treated as 5% Shareholders. Effective March 9, 2018, HNA sold all of
its Park Common Shares.

Applying the tax ownership rules, including the constructive ownership rules,
we believe that, after the Distribution and the Blackstone Restructuring, and
both before and after the HNA Purchase Transaction, (i) Hilton and/or one or
more actual or constructive owners of 10% or more of the Hilton Common Shares
should not be considered to own, actually or constructively, more than 35% of
Park Common Shares, and (ii) the Blackstone Entities that are 5% Shareholders
with respect to Park Common Shares and the Hilton Common Shares, together with
HNA following the HNA Purchase Transaction, collectively should not be
considered to own more than 35% of Park Common Shares and the Hilton Common
Shares. Based on this conclusion and the statements in the Reviewed Documents
and the Park Management Representation Letter, we believe that, commencing
January 4, 2017, Hilton and its subsidiaries should qualify as Eligible
Independent Contractors with respect to the TRS Lessees. However, because the
tax ownership rules and constructive ownership rules are very complex and
there is no or limited authority on certain aspects of those rules that are
relevant to Blackstones ownership for purposes of the 35% Ownership
Requirement, and because the Hilton Common Shares are publicly traded and are
not subject to restrictions on ownership and transfer similar to the
restrictions on ownership and transfer applicable to Park Common Shares, there
can be no assurance that Hilton in fact has satisfied or will satisfy the 35%
Ownership Requirement. If Hilton has not satisfied that requirement at all
times since the Distribution or does not satisfy that requirement in the
future, then Park may fail to qualify as a REIT.
