Dear Sirs,

  



  

 **Offer for China Huiyuan Juice Group Limited ( _Huiyuan_ )**

  



  

The Shareholder understands that an offer is to be made by or on behalf of
the Offeror to acquire all the issued ordinary shares of Huiyuan (the
**_Share Offer_** ), to acquire all the outstanding convertible bonds of
Huiyuan (the **_Convertible Bond Offer_** ) and to cancel all the outstanding
share options of Huiyuan (the **_Option Offer_** and, together with the
Share Offer and the Convertible Bond Offer, the **_Offers_** ), substantially
on the terms of the draft announcement attached as Schedule 3 to this Deed
(the **_Announcement_** ) or on such other terms as may be agreed between the
Offeror and Huiyuan or as may be required to comply with the requirements of
the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (the **_SFC_** ),
the Hong Kong Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the **_Code_** ), The Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the **_Stock Exchange_** ) or the Rules
Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange (the **_Listing
Rules_** ). This Deed sets out the terms and conditions on which the
Shareholder will accept the Share Offer when it is made and sets out certain
undertakings to be given by the Offeror to the Shareholder. The Guarantor has
agreed to guarantee the performance by the Shareholder of its obligations
under this Deed.

  



  

A reference in this Deed to the **_Offers,_** the ** _Share Offer_** , the **
_Convertible Bond Offer_** or the ** _Option Offer_ **also includes any
new, increased, renewed or revised offers made by or on behalf of the Offeror
to acquire shares in Huiyuan, to acquire the outstanding convertible bonds
of Huiyuan or to cancel the share options of Huiyuan, as the case may be,
provided that the terms of such offers are no less favourable to acceptors
than the terms set out in the Announcement.

  



  

Terms defined in Schedule 1 hereto shall have the same meaning in this Deed.

  



  

 **Dealings and undertakings**

  



  

1. The Shareholder undertakes to the Offeror that before the Offers close, lapse or are withdrawn, it shall not:

  



        
   

  



  

(a) sell, transfer, Encumber, or otherwise dispose of any interest in any
Relevant Shares or any Convertible Bonds, other than pursuant to its
acceptance of the Share Offer or the Convertible Bond Offer;

  



  

(b) accept any other offer in respect of the Relevant Shares or the
Convertible Bonds;

  



  

(c) vote in favour of any resolution to approve any scheme of arrangement of

(d) except upon exercise of its rights of conversion under the Convertible
Bonds, acquire, and shall not permit any person acting in concert with it, to
acquire any Shares or any warrants, options, subscription rights or other
rights to subscribe for, acquire or convert into such Shares or any interest
therein or agree to do so without the prior written consent of the Offeror.

  



  

2. The Guarantor undertakes to the Offeror that before the Share Offer closes, lapses or is withdrawn, it shall not, and shall procure that none of his Affiliates shall, enter into any contract or arrangement with any Group Company without the prior written consent of the Offeror, except: (i) pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of any existing contract between the Guarantor and/or any of his Affiliates and a Group Company; and (ii) for contracts or arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business of the Group and on normal arms length commercial terms and which would be treated as de minimis transactions under Rule 14A.31 of the Listing Rules.

3. In consideration of the Offerors undertakings in paragraph 5, the Shareholder undertakes to the Offeror that it:

(c) shall not withdraw any acceptances of the Share Offer and will use its
reasonable efforts to cause HKSCC not to do so;

in all respects, take all steps required of it under the terms of the
Convertible Bonds to convert all its Convertible Bonds into Shares and:

  



  

(i) upon becoming the registered holder of such Shares, it shall accept the
Share Offer in respect of all such Shares in accordance with the procedure

  



        
   

  



  

for acceptance set out in the Composite Document not later than seven days
after becoming the registered holder of such Shares;

  



  

(ii) it shall not withdraw any acceptances of the Share Offer in respect of
such Shares; and

  



  

(iii) it shall sell such Shares free of any Encumbrance and together with all
rights of any nature attaching to those Shares, including the right to all

 **Co-operation in relation to Pre-Condition**

  



  

6. The Offeror, the Shareholder and the Guarantor shall, and, in the case of the Shareholder and the Guarantor, shall use all reasonable efforts to procure that Huiyuan shall, use all reasonable endeavours to co-operate with each other in any dealings with or submissions to any Governmental Authority in connection with the Share Offer to ensure that the Pre-Condition is satisfied promptly after the date of the Announcement and, in connection with such co-operation, the Offeror, the Shareholder and the Guarantor agree that:

7. The Shareholder warrants to the Offeror in terms set out in Schedule 2 to this Deed (the _**Warranties**_ ) as at the date of this Deed and the Completion Date, by reference to the facts and circumstances existing as at such dates respectively.

  



  

8. Each of the Warranties shall be construed as a separate and independent warranty and (except where expressly provided to the contrary) shall not be limited or restricted by reference to or inference from the terms of any other Warranty.

  



  

9. The Warranties are given subject to and are qualified by, any fact, matter or circumstance which has been Disclosed.

  



  

10. The Shareholder undertakes to the Offeror that, as soon as reasonably practicable upon it becoming aware, between the date of this Deed and the Completion Date, of any fact, matter or circumstance relating to any member of the Group, which may constitute a breach of any of the Warranties as at the date of this Deed and/or would constitute a breach if they were repeated at the Completion Date by reference to the facts and circumstances then subsisting, it will promptly disclose in writing such fact, matter or circumstance to the Offeror.

  



  

11. The liability of the Shareholder for any Claim shall be limited in the following manner:

  



  

(a) the liability of the Shareholder for any Claim shall not exceed 41.53%
of such Claim other than a Claim involving a breach of any statements set
out under Part A of Schedule 2 to this Deed (the _**Title Warranties**_ )
provided that the maximum aggregate liability of the Shareholder arising from
a breach of the Title Warranties together with all other Claims shall not
exceed an amount equal to the Consideration received by the Shareholder under
the Share Offer (or an equivalent amount in any other currency);

  



  

(b) the Shareholder shall not be liable for any Claim unless the aggregate
amount of the liability of the Shareholder for Claims brought against the
Shareholder exceeds HK$160,000,000 (or an equivalent amount in any other
currency), in which event the Shareholder will be liable for the full amount
and not just the excess;

  



  

(c) the Shareholder shall not be liable in respect of a Claim unless the
Offeror has given the Shareholder written notice of the Claim (stating in
reasonable detail the

  



        
   

  



  

nature of the Claim and, if practicable, the amount claimed) on or before the
date which is eighteen months after the Completion Date;

  



  

(d) any Claim shall (if it has not been previously satisfied, settled or
withdrawn) be deemed to have been withdrawn 6 months after the notice is
given pursuant to paragraph 11(c) above, unless legal proceedings in respect
of it have been commenced by being both issued and served. No new Claim may
be made in respect of the facts, matters, events or circumstances giving rise
to any such withdrawn Claim;

  



  

(e) if any Claim is based upon a liability which is contingent only, the
Shareholder shall not be liable to pay unless and until such contingent
liability gives rise to an obligation to make a payment (but the Offeror has
the right under paragraph 11(c) above to give notice of that Claim before
such time);

  



  

(f) the Shareholder shall not be liable for any Claim to the extent that it
would not have arisen but for, or has been increased or not reduced as a
result of, any voluntary act, omission or transaction carried out after the
Completion Date by the Offeror or any of its Affiliates (or its or their
respective directors, employees or agents or successors in title) outside the
ordinary and usual course of business of a Group Company as at the Completion
Date;

  



  

(g) the Offeror shall procure that all reasonable steps are taken to avoid or
mitigate any loss or damage which it may suffer in consequence of any breach
by the Shareholder of the terms of this Deed or any fact, matter, event or
circumstance likely to give rise to a Claim;

  



  

(h) the Shareholder shall not be liable in respect of any Claim to the extent
that the amount of such Claim is covered by a policy of insurance effected by
or for the benefit of the Group Companies;

  



  

(i) the Shareholder shall not be liable for any Claim if and to the extent it
is attributable to, or the amount of such Claim is increased as a result of:
(i) any legislation not in force at the date of this Deed; (ii) any change of
law (or any change in interpretation on the basis of case law), regulation,
directive, requirement or administrative practice; or (iii) any change in the
rates of taxation in force at the date of this Deed;

  



  

(j) the Offeror shall not be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment,
reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than once in respect of any one
liability, loss, cost, shortfall, damage, deficiency, breach or other set of
circumstances which gives rise to more than one Claim; and

  



  

(k) if a breach of the Warranties is capable of remedy, the Offeror shall
only be entitled to compensation if it gives the Shareholder written notice
of the breach and the breach is not remedied within 30 days after the date on
which such notice is served on the Shareholder.

  



  

12. Nothing in this Deed shall limit or exclude the liability of the Shareholder to the extent that such liability arises as a result of its own fraud.

  



  

13. The Shareholder undertakes, if any Claim is made against it under this Deed, not to make any claim against any member of the Group or, except where such claim arises out of any fraudulent act by the person against whom the claim is to be made, any director, employee of the Group on which the Shareholder may have relied before agreeing to any terms of

  



        
   

  



  

this Deed.

  



  

14. The Guarantor warrants to the Offeror, as at the date of this Deed and the Completion Date, by reference to the facts and circumstances existing as at such dates respectively, that:

  



  

(a) he has obtained or satisfied all regulatory and other approvals, and any
other conditions, necessary to execute and perform his obligations under this
Deed; and

  



  

(b) the execution and delivery by him of this Deed, and the performance and
completion of this Deed by him:

  



  

(i) will not infringe any applicable laws;

  



  

(ii) will not result in any breach of the terms of, or constitute a default
under, any instrument, agreement or governmental, regulatory or other
judgment, decree or order to which he is a party or by which he is bound; and

  



  

(iii) will not conflict with any certificates, licences or permits he holds
that enables him to carry on any business or operations operated by him; and

  



  

(c) this Deed constitutes legal, valid and binding obligations of him
enforceable in accordance with its terms.

  



  

15. Each of the Shareholder and the Guarantor acknowledges that the Offeror has entered into this Deed in reliance upon the Warranties and the warranties set out in paragraph 14.

  



  

 **Termination**

  



  

16. This Deed shall automatically terminate if:

  



  

(a) the Announcement is not released within ten Business Days of the date of
this Deed (or such later date as the Offeror and the Shareholder may agree);

  



  

(b) the Offers are not made (by posting of the Composite Document) by the
Latest Despatch Date;

  



  

(c) the Offers include any material terms or are subject to any conditions
other than those set out in the draft of the Announcement; or

  



  

(d) the Share Offer lapses or is withdrawn.

  



  

17. Termination of this Deed shall be without prejudice to a partys accrued rights and remedies, obligations and liabilities under this Deed as at the date of such termination.

  



  

 **Guarantee**

  



  

18. In consideration of the Shareholder entering into this Deed at the request of the Guarantor, the Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Offeror, as primary obligations of it:

  



  

(a) the due and punctual performance and observance by the Shareholder of its
obligations, commitments and undertakings under this Deed; and

  



  

(b) if and whenever the Shareholder shall be in default in the payment of any
amount payable under or in connection with this Deed or of any damages for
breach of the

  



        
   

  



  

same or any of the Warranties or any other warranties, representations or
undertakings contained herein after being given notice to that effect by the
Offeror, to pay to the Offeror all such amounts that are payable by the
Shareholder as though the Guarantor instead of the Shareholder was expressed
to be the principal debtor.

  



  

19. The liability of the Guarantor under this Deed shall not be released or diminished by any arrangements or alterations of terms or any forbearance, neglect or delay in seeking performance of the obligations hereby imposed or any granting of time or other indulgence for such performance.

  



  

20. The guarantee under paragraph 18 is to be a continuing security to the Offeror for all obligations, commitments and undertakings on the part of the Shareholder under this Deed. Any amount not paid by the Shareholder and not recoverable from the Guarantor on the basis of a guarantee (whether because of any legal limitation, disability or incapacity on the part of the Shareholder or any other matter or thing whether known to the Offeror or not) shall nevertheless be recoverable from the Guarantor on the basis of an indemnity.

  



  

21. As a separate and independent obligation, the Guarantor undertakes, as principal obligor and not only as surety, that in the event the Shareholder does not perform in full its obligations, commitments and undertakings under this Deed, the Guarantor will itself then duly and punctually perform the obligations, commitments and undertakings of the Shareholder under this Deed as if all such obligations, commitments and undertakings were obligations, commitments and undertakings of the Guarantor.

  



  

 **Appointment of attorney**

  



  

22. In order to secure the performance of the Shareholders obligations under paragraph 3, the Shareholder hereby irrevocably appoints any director for the time being of the Offeror to be its attorney and agent in its name and on its behalf to execute a form or forms of acceptance and/or such other documents and do such other acts and things as may be necessary to accept (or procure the acceptance of) the Offers in respect of the Relevant Shares and/or the Convertible Bonds PROVIDED THAT such director shall only be authorised to execute such documents and perform such actions on the Shareholders behalf if the Shareholder has failed to comply with its obligations under paragraph 3.

  



  

 **Further assurance**

  



  

23. At any time after the date of this Deed, each party shall, and shall use all reasonable endeavours to procure that any necessary third party shall, execute such documents and do such acts and things as any other party may reasonably require for the purpose of giving that party the full benefit of all the provisions of this Deed in their favour.

  



  

 **Undertaking survives**

  



  

24. The Warranties, the warranties under paragraph 14 and all other provisions of this Deed, insofar as the same shall not have been performed upon the Completion Date, shall remain in full force and effect.

  



  

 **General**

  



  

25. This Deed may be executed in any number of separate counterparts, each of which is an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  



        
   

  



  

26. The failure to exercise or delay in exercising a right or remedy provided by this Deed or by law does not impair or constitute a waiver of the right or remedy or an impairment of a waiver of other rights or remedies. No single or partial exercise of a right or remedy provided under this Deed or by law prevents further exercise of the right or remedy or the exercise of another right or remedy.

  



  

27. If at any time any provision of this Deed is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable under the laws of any jurisdiction, that shall not affect:

  



  

(a) the legality, validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any
other provision of this Deed; or

  



  

(b) the legality, validity or enforceability under the law of any other
jurisdiction of that or another provision of this Deed.

  



  

28. Each party agrees that, if it fails to perform or breaches any of the obligations under this Deed, damages may not be an adequate remedy and accordingly, the parties to whom any such unperformed or breached obligation is owed shall be entitled to the remedy of specific performance.

  



  

 **Notices**

  



  

29. A notice or other communication under or in connection with this Deed (a **_Notice_** ) shall be in writing; in the English language; and delivered personally or sent by registered post (or air mail if overseas) or by fax to the party due to receive the Notice to the address set out in paragraph 31.

35. The parties to the Dispute agree to facilitate the arbitration by: (i) cooperating in good faith to expedite, the conduct of the arbitration; (ii) conducting arbitration hearings to the greatest extent possible on successive Business Days; and (iii) using their best efforts to observe the time periods established by the Arbitration Rules or by the Arbitration Board for the submission of evidence and briefs.

  



  

36. In order to facilitate the comprehensive resolution of related Disputes, all claims that arise under or in connection with this Deed may be brought in a single arbitration. Upon the request of any party to such arbitration, the Arbitration Board for such proceeding shall be entitled to consolidate any arbitration proceeding constituted under this Deed with any other arbitration proceeding constituted under this Deed, if the Arbitration Board determines that (i) there are issues of fact or law common to the proceedings so that a consolidated proceeding would be more efficient than separate proceedings, and (ii) no party would be unduly prejudiced as a result of such consolidation through undue delay or otherwise. No such consolidation shall take place unless the parties to all the relevant arbitrations are identical. In the event of different rulings on consolidation by the Arbitration Board constituted hereunder and another Arbitration Board constituted under this Deed, the ruling of the Arbitration Board constituted first in time shall control. Such

  



        
   

  



  

Arbitration Board shall serve as the tribunal for any
consolidated arbitration, and shall have the power to make all orders
consequential upon and for the purposes of facilitating the consolidation of
the arbitrations, including orders as to costs.

  



  

37. The costs and expenses of the arbitration, including the fees of the Arbitration Board, shall be borne equally by each party to the Dispute, and each party shall pay its own fees, disbursements and other charges of its counsel; provided that the Arbitration Board shall have the right to allocate the costs and expenses between each party as the Arbitration Board deems equitable.

  



  

38. The award of the Arbitration Board shall be final and binding upon the disputing parties, and any party to the Dispute may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement of such award. Any party to the Dispute shall, prior to the appointment of the Arbitration Board, be entitled to seek preliminary injunctive relief, to prevent irreparable harm from any court of competent jurisdiction pending the constitution of the Arbitration Board. Without prejudice to such provisional remedies that may be granted by a national court, the Arbitration Board shall have full authority to grant provisional remedies, to order a party to seek modification or vacation of an injunction issued by a national court, and to award damages for the failure of any party to respect the Arbitration Boards orders to that effect.
