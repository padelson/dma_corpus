a mutually acceptable Independent Accounting Firm to resolve the dispute in
accordance with the standards contained in this Section 2.7. All of the fees

concept exists) as a foreign limited liability company, corporation or other
legal entity, as applicable, in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing
or operation of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized,
existing, in good standing or qualified, or to have such power or authority,
is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. A correct and complete copy of the Organizational
Documents of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as amended to the date
of this Agreement, has been made available to Purchaser, and each such
Organizational Document is in full force and effect.

other similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditorÂ’s rights and to general equitable principles, whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law, except for immaterial failures to be in such

Governmental Authority in connection with the CompanyÂ’s execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions,
except for those where the failure to obtain is not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (collectively, the " _Company Third Party
Consents_ ").

 



 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the compliance by the Company with the provisions hereof do not and will
not constitute or result in (i) a breach or violation of the Organizational
Documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (ii) subject to obtaining the
Company Third Party Consents, a breach or violation of, a termination (or
right of termination) or default (or an event that with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, the creation or acceleration of

Section 3.4 _Financial Information_. (a) Section 3.4(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth complete and accurate copies of (i) (x) the
audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 and (y) the audited consolidated statements
of operations, membersÂ’ capital and cash flows of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
2008 (collectively, the " _Audited Financial Statements_ "), and (ii) (x) the
unaudited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 and (y) the unaudited
consolidated statements of operations, membersÂ’ capital and cash flows of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2011 and September 30, 2010 (collectively, the " _Unaudited Financial
Statements_ "). The Audited Financial Statements and the Unaudited Financial
Statements, including the notes thereto, are sometimes collectively referred
to herein as the " _Financial Statements_ "; and the unaudited

 



      
 

 



 

consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of September
30, 2011 (the " _Most Recent Balance Sheet Date_ ") is referred to as the "
_Most Recent Balance Sheet_." The Financial Statements (including the related
notes and schedules) (x) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on
a consistent basis during the periods involved and (y) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of operations, membersÂ’ capital and cash flows of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods then ended, except that the
Unaudited Financial Statements do not include accruals for professional fees
for tax and audit services, equity compensation, and annual bonuses, which the
Company customarily accrues at year-end, and do not contain all of the
footnotes required by GAAP. Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has been no
material change in any accounting policies, principles, methods or practices
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintained systems of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with managementÂ’s general or
specific authority, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
proper accountability for items, (iii) access to their property and assets is
permitted only in accordance with managementÂ’s general or specific authority,
and (iv) the recorded accountability for items is compared with the actual
levels at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to
any differences.

 



 

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have no Liabilities (including off
balance sheet liabilities as of the date of this Agreement relating to the
acquisition or financing of Motion Pictures and any other material off balance
sheet Indebtedness) other than (i) Liabilities to the extent reflected,
accrued, disclosed or reserved in the Most Recent Balance Sheet, (ii)
Liabilities which do not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) individually
or Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) in the aggregate and were incurred by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Most Recent Balance Sheet
Date, and (iii) Liabilities disclosed in Section 3.4(c)(iii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt, if Section 3.4(c)(iii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule discloses Liabilities under clause (ii) in excess
of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) in the aggregate, then Liabilities which
do not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) do not need to be individually
scheduled.

 



 

(d) All of the material Accounts Receivable reflected in the most recent
Unaudited Financial Statements and all of the material Accounts Receivable
arising between the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date and the date of this
Agreement (i) arose in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, and (ii) subject to reasonable reserves set forth in the most recent
Unaudited Financial Statements, are not subject to any right of set-off or
counterclaim that has been asserted or is reasonably likely to be asserted
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by the respective obligor. No
Accounts Receivable have been pledged or assigned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person other than in connection with the Credit Facilities
and Foreign Rights Loans.

 



 

(e) Section 3.4(e)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Foreign
Rights Loans and all loans made against a "tax-credit" or subsidy of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are outstanding as of the date hereof.
Section 3.4(e)(ii) of the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Disclosure Schedule lists all of the participation and residual audits of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, in each case, of which the Company has received
written notice and which are not closed, as of the date of this Agreement.

payments relating to undelivered or uncompleted Motion Pictures owned and/or
controlled by the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries.

participations and residuals paid by the Company or accrued on the CompanyÂ’s
Books and Records from the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date to December 31,
2011; _provided_ that without prejudice to any other representation or
warranty in this Agreement, no representation is made with respect to (i) the
accuracy of such ultimates or (ii) whether the amount of participations will
be higher than as reflected on Section 3.4(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule as a result of the gross receipts of any such Motion Picture being
greater than as reflected on such ultimate statement.

 



 

(h) Since the Balance Sheet Date, the methodology used by the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries to compute its first cycle (10 year) film ultimates has
remained substantially the same (the " _Ultimate Methodology_ "). Each film
ultimate for a Library Motion Picture prepared by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries was created using the CompanyÂ’s Ultimate Methodology. Section
3.4(h)(1) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the ultimates used by
the Company in the preparation of the September 30, 2011 Unaudited Financial
Statements (the " _September 30 Ultimates_ "). As of September 30, 2011, the
Company had no Knowledge of any facts, circumstances or events that would
cause the Company to materially restate the September 30 Ultimates. The
schedule set forth in Section 3.4(h)(2) of the Company Disclosure Schedule of
cash amounts actually paid to third parties and received by the Company and
its Subsidiaries (other than to or from the Company to or from any Subsidiary)
as of September 30, 2011 in respect of the Library Motion Pictures and Motion
Pictures in Progress set forth in Section 3.4(h)(2) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule is true and accurate in all material respects. Section 3.4(h)(3) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the ultimates as of January 6, 2012
for the Library Motion Pictures set forth on Section 3.4(h)(3) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and which the Company expects, as of the date of this
Agreement, to be the basis for the ultimates to be provided to the CompanyÂ’s
auditors in connection with the audit of the CompanyÂ’s 2011 annual financial
statements.

Sheet Date, (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries have operated their

sponsored or contributed to, or has or had within the past six (6) years any

liability of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates following the Closing Date.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any

Affiliates, accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment
or funding of compensation or benefits under, or increase the amount payable

(h) There are no pending or, to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, Threatened Actions
relating to any Benefit Plan that could reasonably be expected to become a
liability of the Company or Purchasers. No assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries are subject to any Lien under ERISA Section 302(f). Each
individual who renders services to Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is

grant, extend or enter into any such Commitments or Contract. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations of Parent, Purchasers or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Equity

operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in a material respect ParentÂ’s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any material
fraud known to Parent that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in internal controls. Parent has made available to the

out actions or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date (including
the Transactions) (i) to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, or (ii)
if the protections afforded thereby to an Indemnified D/O Party are greater,
to the same extent and on the same terms and conditions provided for in the
Organizational Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any
indemnification agreements in effect at the date hereof (to the extent
consistent with applicable law) (and of any entity that shall succeed to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by merger, consolidation or otherwise),
which provisions shall survive the Closing Date and continue in full force and

officer insurance coverage and EPLI coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the aggregate cost of such coverage shall not be in excess of 300% of the last

Section 6.7 _Employee Related Covenants_.

 



 

(a) In the event that any person who is an employee of the Company or any of

severance benefits as set forth on Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (each an " _Affected Employee_ ") is discharged by the Company at the
direction of Purchasers or their Affiliates after the Closing Date under
circumstances entitling the Affected Employee to severance, then the Company
(on behalf of Purchasers) and not Sellers shall be responsible for those
severance costs set forth on Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
for such Affected Employee. Except for the severance benefits set forth on
such Section 6.7(a) and severance benefits provided based on PurchasersÂ’
severance policy for similarly situated employees of Purchasers (which has
previously been disclosed to Sellers), as may be amended from time to time,
following the Closing Date to employees of the Company or any of its

terminated at the direction of Purchasers following the Closing Date,
Purchasers shall not be responsible for any severance costs relating to
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who continues as
an employee of Purchasers or any of their Subsidiaries following the Closing

benefit plans that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
benefit plans generally provided to similarly situated employees of Purchasers
and their Subsidiaries as in effect from time to time; _provided_ , that, for
purposes of the foregoing, the benefit plans generally provided to employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing
Date shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing standard, it being understood
that the Continuing Employees may commence participating in the benefit plans
of Purchasers and their Subsidiaries on different

 



      
 

 



 

dates following the Closing Date with respect to different benefit plans.
Under the employee benefit plans of Purchasers and their Subsidiaries
providing benefits to Continuing Employees (each, a " _Post-Closing Plan_ "),
(i) each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company as of the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and, solely for purposes of vacation and severance, benefit accrual,
to the same extent as such service credit was provided before the Closing Date
under any similar plans of the Company, except to the extent such service
credit would result in duplication of benefits for the same period and other
than under any defined benefit retirement plan or retiree medical plan or
frozen or grandfathered plan of Purchasers or their Subsidiaries, and (ii)
each Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (A) each
Post-Closing Plan providing for healthcare benefits to waive pre-existing
condition limitations to the extent waived or not applicable under the
analogous Benefit Plan, and (B) the Continuing Employees to be given credit
under each Post-Closing Plan that provides for healthcare benefits for amounts
paid under the analogous Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date during the
year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of applying deductibles,
co-payments and out of pocket maximums, as though such amounts had been paid
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Post-Closing Plan, in each
case, _provided_ that such information is timely provided to Purchasers or the
administrator of the Post-Closing Plans, as applicable, in a form reasonably
acceptable to the plan administrator.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 10.10, the provisions of this
Section 6.7 are solely for the benefit of the Company and Purchasers, and no
current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall
be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. In
no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend,
or modify any Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by Purchasers, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of Purchasers or any of
their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan, employment
agreement or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon any current or former
employee, officer, partner, member, director or consultant, any right to
employment or continued employment or continued service with Purchasers or any
of their Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Company and
its Subsidiaries), preclude the ability of Purchasers or any of their
Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to terminate the employment or services of any employee,
officer, partner, member, director or consultant for any reason, or constitute
or create an employment agreement with any such person.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Registration_.

with the SEC its quarterly report on Form 10-Q in respect of the quarterly
period ended December 31, 2011 and in any event not later than one hundred and
twenty (120) calendar days after the date of this Agreement (the " _S-3
Deadline_ "), Parent shall file with the SEC an automatically effective shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 or, if not an automatically effective shelf
registration statement, use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
registration

 



      
 

 



 

statement to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable after
filing (and in any event no later than ninety (90) days after filing) and, in
each case, remain effective (or replace such registration statement with
another registration statement that is and remains effective) for a period of
at least two (2) years after effectiveness (as extended as necessary to
account for any periods during such two-year period that the registration
statement was not effective, usable or available, including because it
contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (each, a
" _Suspension Period_ ")) (the " _Effectiveness Period_ "), to register for
resale the Share Consideration and Additional Share Consideration (if any) in
accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof as may
be consented by Parent by the holders of the Share Consideration and
Additional Share Consideration who desire to sell their shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to such registration statement (each, a " _Holder_ ")
(the " _S-3 Registration Statement_ "); _provided_ , that as a condition to
the filing of such S-3 Registration Statement, each Holder shall provide
Purchaser with completed security holder questionnaires with responses subject
to PurchaserÂ’s reasonable approval; _provided_ , _further_ , that all expenses
incurred by Parent and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection with their
performance of or compliance with this Section 6.8 shall be borne by Parent
regardless of whether the S-3 Registration Statement becomes effective, and,
in connection with the S-3 Registration Statement, Purchasers shall reimburse
the Holders for the reasonable fees and disbursements of not more than one
counsel chosen by the Holders (which fees and disbursements shall in no event
exceed Seventy Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000)). Purchasers agree, jointly and
severally, to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, its directors, officers
and each Person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) such holder, from and
against any and all Losses actually incurred in connection with investigating
or defending any matter, including any action that could reasonably be
expected give rise to any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in the S-3 Registration Statement, related preliminary
prospectus or prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or caused
by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case
of a preliminary prospectus or prospectus, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made) not misleading, except insofar as such Losses are
caused by an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
omission that is based upon information relating to any of the holders
furnished in writing to Purchasers or Parent by or on behalf of any of the
Holders. Sellers acknowledge that pending registration of the Share
Consideration and Additional Share Consideration as contemplated by this
Section 6.8, the shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Share
Consideration and Additional Share Consideration shall bear customary
restrictive legends in accordance with applicable Securities Laws. The
provisions of this Section 6.8 shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the successors and assigns of each of Sellers, including, and without the
need for an express assignment, subsequent Holders (except with respect to any
shares of Parent Common Stock which have been registered as contemplated by
this Section 6.8 and are subsequently sold or otherwise disposed of or
transferred). The Holders shall be third party beneficiaries to this Section
6.8, and shall have the right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.8
directly to the extent they may deem such enforcement necessary or advisable
to protect such HoldersÂ’ rights hereunder.

 



 

(b) In the event that Parent (i) fails to file and have become effective the
S-3 Registration Statement on or prior to the applicable time periods set
forth in Section 6.8(a)

 



      
 

 



 

or (ii) fails to keep the S-3 Registration Statement effective for the
Effectiveness Period (each, a " _Registration Default_ "), then Parent agrees
to pay to each Holder affected thereby, as liquidated damages (which shall be
the HoldersÂ’ sole remedy for any Registration Default), from and including the
date on which any Registration Default shall occur and to but excluding the
date on which such Registration Default has been cured, cash in an amount per
calendar month equal to 1% of the value of the Share Consideration and
Additional Share Consideration held by such Holder (valued for such purposes
based on the VWAP as of the applicable Payment Date (as defined below)),
payable in arrears on each Payment Date, with payments for partial months
being prorated based on the actual number of trading days in such calendar
month during which such Registration Default continued relative to the total
number of trading dates in such calendar month; _provided_ that Parent shall
in no event be required to pay Liquidated Damages for more than one

 **ARTICLE VII _ 
TAX MATTERS_**

 



 

Section 7.1 _Tax Indemnities_.

 



 

(a) _Sellers Tax Indemnities_. Sellers shall be responsible for and shall
indemnify and hold Purchasers and their respective Affiliates harmless from
and against (i) Excluded Taxes, (ii) Taxes arising from or in connection with
any breach by Sellers of any covenant contained in this Agreement, and (iii)
all cost and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses,
attributable to any item in clauses (i) and (ii); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Sellers shall not be liable for (A) any Taxes (or costs and expense
related thereto) attributable to actions not in the ordinary course of
business not contemplated by this Agreement taken by Purchasers, the Company,
or any of their respective Subsidiaries on the Closing Date and after the
Closing, or (B) any Taxes (or costs and expense related thereto) to the extent
of the amount of the liability for such Tax set forth on Section 7.1(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) _Purchasers Tax Indemnities_. Purchasers and Parent shall be jointly and
severally responsible for and shall indemnify and hold Sellers and their
respective Affiliates harmless from and against (i) all Taxes imposed with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than Excluded Taxes,
(ii) Taxes arising from or in connection with any breach by a Purchaser of any
covenant contained in this Agreement, (iii) Transfer Taxes required to be
borne by Purchasers pursuant to Section 7.5, (iv) any Taxes attributable to
actions not in the ordinary course of business not contemplated by this
Agreement taken by Purchasers, the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date and after the Closing, and (v) all cost and
expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to any
item in clauses (i), (ii), or (iii).

 



       
 

 



 

(c) _Straddle Period Allocation_. In the case of Taxes other than Transfer
Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any
such Tax that is allocable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be:

 



 

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or measured by
reference to income, gain, or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any
sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible
or intangible) (other than conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, as provided
in Section 7.5), the Tax that would be due with respect to the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period if such period ended on and included the Closing Date. Each
Subsidiary that is treated as a partnership or "flow-through" entity for Tax
purposes shall be treated as if its taxable year ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date and Taxes attributable to the income and gain of
each such entity through the close of business on the Closing Date shall be
considered to be attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period; and

 



 

(ii) in the case of Taxes not covered by paragraph (i) above, the product of
(x) the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period, multiplied by (y)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period.

 



 

Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period that are not allocable to the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period will be allocable to the Post-Closing Straddle Period.
Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle
Period shall be prorated based upon the method employed in this Section
7.1(b), taking into account the type of Tax to which such credit or refund
relates.

 



 

(d) _Tax Payments_. Payment of any amount due under this Section 7.1 shall be
made within fifteen (15) Business Days following written notice that payment
of related Taxes to the appropriate Governmental Authority is due; _provided_
that neither party shall be required to make any payment earlier than five (5)
Business Days before the related Taxes are due to the appropriate Governmental
Authority; _provided_ , _further_ , that for so long as there are sufficient
shares of Parent Common Stock or cash in the Indemnification Escrow Fund, the
indemnification obligations of Sellers pursuant to Section 7.1(a) may only be
satisfied by the release by the Escrow Agent to Purchasers, pursuant to the
terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, of all or a portion, as
applicable, of such shares of Parent Common Stock or cash in the
Indemnification Escrow Fund having a determined value (determined using the
VWAP as of the release date) equal to the amount of the indemnification
obligation of Sellers pursuant to Section 7.1(a). In the case of a Tax that is
contested in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.2, payment of the Tax
to the appropriate Governmental Authority shall be considered to be due no
earlier than the date a Final Tax Determination to such effect is made by the
appropriate Governmental Authority.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Tax Contests_. (a) After the Closing, Purchaser shall notify
Sellers in writing within fifteen (15) days of receiving any proposed claim,
assessment, deficiency, review, examination or commencement of any Tax audit
or administrative or judicial

 



      
 

 



 

proceeding and of any Tax demand or claim (a " _Contest_ ") that either
relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, a Pre-Closing Straddle Period or any
other Contest for which a Seller may be liable for Taxes (whether pursuant to
indemnification under this Agreement, or otherwise). Such notice shall contain
factual information describing the asserted Contest in reasonable detail and
shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any
Governmental Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability. A
failure by Purchaser to give such notice shall not affect PurchasersÂ’ right to
indemnification under Section 6.1, except to the extent that SellerÂ’s right to
contest such Tax liability is materially prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(b) In the case of Contest that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, SellersÂ’
Representative shall have the sole right, at SellersÂ’ expense, to control the
conduct of the Contest.

 



 

(i) To the extent SellersÂ’ Representative elects to direct a Contest relating
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, SellersÂ’ Representative shall within fifteen (15)
days of receipt of the notice of asserted Tax liability notify Purchaser of
its intent to do so, and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate and shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate in each phase of such
Contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) SellersÂ’ Representative shall
consult with Purchaser before taking any significant action in connection with
such Contest if such Contest could reasonably be expected to have an adverse
effect on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries), and (2) Sellers shall not compromise,
settle or abandon any Contest if such action could reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) , without obtaining PurchaserÂ’s
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) unless Sellers have agreed to indemnify Purchasers against any
such increased Tax liability.

 



 

(ii) If SellersÂ’ Representative elects not to direct the Contest, then
Purchaser or its Affiliates may assume control of such Contest at SellersÂ’
sole expense. In such event, (1) Purchaser shall keep SellersÂ’ Representative
reasonably informed on a timely basis regarding the progress and substantive
aspects of any Contest, including providing SellersÂ’ Representative with all
written materials relating to such Tax proceeding submitted to and received
from any Governmental Authority, (2) SellersÂ’ Representative shall be entitled
to participate in any Contest at SellersÂ’ expense, including having an
opportunity to comment on any written materials prepared in connection with
any Contest and attending any conferences relating to any Contest, and (3)
neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall compromise, settle or
abandon any Contest if such action could reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on Sellers or any of their Affiliates without obtaining
SellersÂ’ prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) unless Purchaser has agreed to indemnify Sellers
against any such increased Tax liability.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) In the case of a Contest that relates to a Post-Closing Tax Period,
Purchaser or its Affiliates shall have the sole right, at PurchaserÂ’s sole
expense, to control the conduct of the Contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that
SellersÂ’ Representative shall be permitted, at SellersÂ’ expense, to be present
at all proceedings and review all correspondence and submissions related to
any such Contest if such action could reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on Sellers or any of their Affiliates. Neither Purchaser nor
any of its Affiliates shall compromise, settle or abandon any Contest if such
action could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Sellers or
any of their Affiliates without obtaining SellersÂ’ prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless
Purchaser has agreed to indemnify Sellers against any such increased Tax
liability.

 



 

(d) In the case of a Contest for a Straddle Period of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the Controlling Party shall have the right to control, at its
own expense, such Contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Controlling
Party shall provide the Non-controlling Party with a timely and reasonably
detailed account of each stage of such Contest, (ii) the Controlling Party
shall consult with the Non-controlling Party and offer the Non-controlling
Party an opportunity to comment before submitting any written materials
prepared or furnished in connection with such Contest, (iii) the Controlling
Party shall defend such Contest diligently and in good faith as if it were the
only party in interest in connection with such Contest, (iv) the Non-
controlling Party shall be entitled to participate in such Contest, at its own
expense, if such Contest could have an adverse impact on the Non-controlling
Party or any of its Affiliates and (v) the Controlling Party shall not settle,
compromise or abandon any such Contest without obtaining the prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, of the Non-controlling Party if such settlement, compromise or
abandonment could have an adverse impact on the Non-controlling Party or any
of its Affiliates. " _Controlling Party_ " shall mean whichever of the
SellersÂ’ Representative or Purchaser is reasonably expected to bear the
greater Tax liability in connection with a Straddle Period Contest, and "
_Non-controlling Party_ " shall mean whichever of the SellersÂ’ Representative
or Purchaser is not the Controlling Party with respect to such Straddle Period
Contest.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. Sellers shall prepare and file, on a basis
consistent with past practice, all Tax Returns that relate to or include the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and are required to be filed with respect
to any taxable period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Pre-
Closing Tax Period. Sellers shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes shown as
due thereon. Except where counsel of Sellers determines that a contrary
position is required by law, all such Tax Returns of the Company shall be
prepared in a manner reasonably consistent with past practices employed by the
Company to the extent that failing to do so could reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on Purchasers. Sellers shall provide Purchaser with a
copy of each Pre-Closing Tax Return at least twenty (20) calendar days prior
to the applicable due date, along with supporting work papers, for PurchaserÂ’s
review and comment. Seller shall consider any comments of Purchaser in good
faith to the extent such comment relates to a position taken by the Seller on
such Tax Return that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on
Purchasers. Any Tax Return that relates to or includes a Pre-Closing Tax
Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prepared by Sellers and
required to be filed by the Company after the Closing shall be furnished by
Sellers to Purchaser

 



      
 

 



 

or the applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be, for signature and filing at
least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return (taking into account extensions); _provided_ that signing and filing a
Tax Return pursuant to this subsection shall not be considered an
acknowledgment that such Tax Return complies with the requirements of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Straddle Period Tax Returns_. Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause
to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Straddle Period.
Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes shown as due thereon. All
such Tax Returns will be prepared in a manner reasonably consistent with past
practices employed by the Company, except where counsel of Purchaser or the
Company determines that a contrary position is required by Law. Purchaser
shall provide SellersÂ’ Representative with a copy of each Straddle Period Tax
Return at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the applicable due date,
along with supporting work papers, for SellersÂ’ RepresentativeÂ’s review,
comment and approval, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

 



 

(c) _Disputes_. SellersÂ’ Representative and Purchaser shall attempt in good
faith to resolve any disagreement with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Return or
a Straddle Period Tax Return, including any allocation pursuant to Section
7.1(c). In the event that SellersÂ’ Representative and Purchaser are unable to
do so at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the due date for filing, such
dispute will be resolved by an Independent Accounting Firm, which resolution
will be binding on the parties.

 



 

Section 7.4 _[Intentionally Omitted]_

 



 

Section 7.5 _Tax Cooperation; Refunds and Credits_. (a) SellersÂ’
Representative and Purchasers shall provide each other, upon request, as
promptly as practicable, with such cooperation and information as either of
them may reasonably request of the other (and Purchasers shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to provide such cooperation and information) in
connection with preparing and finalizing the Allocation pursuant to Section
2.7 and in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund,
making any Tax election, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a
refund of Taxes, or participating in or conducting any audit or other
proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include
providing copies of relevant Books and Records, Tax Returns or portions
thereof, together with related work papers and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by Governmental Authorities. Sellers and Purchasers
shall make themselves (and their respective employees) reasonably available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide explanations of any documents or
information provided under this Section 7.5. Any information obtained under
this Section 7.5 shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or
in conducting an audit or other proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Purchasers shall not have any access to any books
and records, Tax Returns or other information of Sellers or their Affiliates
that do not relate directly to the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Purchaser shall
make available appropriate Company personnel as may be reasonably requested by
SellersÂ’ Representative at no cost to the SellersÂ’ Representative to assist
SellersÂ’ Representative in the preparation of all Tax Returns required to be
filed by the Sellers including without limitation the Pre-Closing Tax Returns
and to work with SellersÂ’

 



      
 

 



 

Representative in the review of any Straddle Period Tax Returns; _provided_
that no assistance provided pursuant to this Section 7.5(a) shall include or
constitute the provision of tax advice.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in the following sentence, Purchaser shall
pay or cause to be paid to Sellers any refunds of Taxes (including interests
thereon) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period received by or credited to
Purchasers, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of such
refund. Purchaser shall be entitled to any refunds of Taxes of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (including any combined, consolidated, unitary or
affiliated group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or has
been a member) that is attributable to the carryback of any Tax attribute
arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period. Any refunds of Taxes of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning after the Closing
Date shall be for the account of Purchaser. Any refunds of Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period shall be equitably
apportioned between Sellers and Purchaser in accordance with the principles
set forth in Section 7.1(b). Each Purchaser shall forward, and shall cause its
Affiliates to forward, to the party entitled pursuant to this subsection to a
refund of Taxes, the amount of such refund within ten (10) Business Days after
such refund is received or applied against another Tax liability, in each
case, net of any costs to the party receiving such refund.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Transfer Taxes_. All Tax Returns with respect to all federal,
state, local or foreign taxes, sales, use, value added, transfer (including
real property transfer or gains), stamp, stock transfer and similar Taxes
together with any interest, additions or penalties with respect thereto and
any interest in respect of such additions or penalties (but excluding any
income or franchise Taxes) (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") imposed with
respect to the purchase and sale of the Membership Interests pursuant to this
Agreement shall be timely filed by the party responsible for such filing under
applicable Law, and all such Transfer Taxes (and all out-of-pocket costs for
preparation of such Tax Returns) shall be borne equally by Purchasers (in
accordance with the allocation between Purchasers as set forth on _Schedule B_
) and Sellers. Purchasers and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate to reduce or
eliminate any Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable Law. If
Sellers or Purchasers pay a Transfer Tax at the Closing or pursuant to a post-
Closing assessment by a Governmental Authority, the other party will reimburse
the paying party for fifty percent (50%) of the amount of such Transfer Tax
within fifteen (15) days of the paying partyÂ’s written demand therefor.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Other Tax Matters_. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (i) the covenants and agreements of Sellers and
Purchasers contained in this Article VII shall survive the Closing and shall
remain in full force and effect until ninety (90) days after the expiration of
the relevant statutes of limitation (except that the indemnification
obligations of Sellers with respect to any breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.6(p)_ shall survive until the seventh
anniversary of the Closing Date), and (ii) indemnification for any and all Tax
matters, and the procedures with respect thereto, shall be governed
exclusively by this Article VII and shall not be governed by Article IX
(except that the limitations set forth in Sections 9.4(b)(i), 9.4(b)(iii),
9.4(c) and 9.4(d) shall apply to any indemnification by Seller pursuant to
this Article VII other than, with respect to _Section 9.4(b)(i)_, any
indemnification by Sellers with respect to a breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.6(p)_).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement between Sellers or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be terminated, and
all payments thereunder shall be settled, immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

(c) The parties agree to treat any indemnity payments pursuant to this Article
VII and Article IX as an adjustment to the purchase price of the Membership
Interests for income Tax purposes, except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a Final Tax Determination.

 



 

(d) The parties agree to treat a portion of any Bonus Amount paid pursuant to
Section 2.2(e) as interest for income Tax purposes in accordance with Section
483 of the Code (or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign Law).

 



 

(e) Purchasers shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental
Authority and give Sellers reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such Books and Records.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Section 754 Election_. The Company and each Subsidiary (other
than any such Subsidiary that is properly classified as a disregarded entity
or a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that does not have a
valid election under Section 754 of the Code in effect shall make such a valid
election effective prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 7.9 _IRS Form 8308_. Within thirty (30) days following the Closing
Date, Purchasers shall cause the Company to furnish a copy of IRS Form 8308 to
each Seller and the Purchaser of such SellerÂ’s Membership Interests (or, to
the extent Purchasers each acquire a portion of a SellerÂ’s Membership
Interests, one copy of IRS Form 8308 to Seller and each respective Purchaser
with respect to each respective PurchaserÂ’s purchase of such Membership
Interests).

Section 9.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations
and warranties of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement shall survive

and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.6(p), 3.23, 4.1, 4.4, 4.5,
5.1, 5.2, 5.6(b), 5.9 and 5.14 which shall survive until the seventh
anniversary of the Closing Date (such sections, collectively, the "
_Indefinite Survival Sections_ ") and (ii) the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.6 (other than Section 3.6(p)), which shall survive the
Closing until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a written notice of an
indemnifiable claim has been given in good faith prior to the applicable
expiration date under this Section 9.1, then the party giving such notice
shall continue to have the right to be indemnified with respect to the matter
or matters to which such claim relates until such claim has

 



      
 

 



 

been finally determined by (i) mutual written agreement of Purchasers and
Sellers or (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Indemnification by Sellers_. Except with respect to Taxes, which
shall be governed exclusively by Article VII and subject to Section 9.4 and
the provisions of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, Sellers shall
indemnify and hold harmless Purchasers and their respective Affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates,
successors and assigns (each, a " _Purchaser Indemnified Party_ "):

 



 

(a) severally and not jointly for and against all Losses suffered or incurred
by them in connection with, arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement (disregarding for purposes of determining the amount of Losses any
materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualification contained in
any such representation or warranty but subject to the dollar limitations set
forth in Section 9.4(b)), (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company in this Agreement, including failure to adhere to the
Limit Amount, and (iii) any Action brought by a holder or former holder of
Unit Appreciation Rights with respect to such Unit Appreciation Rights or the
treatment thereof pursuant to Section 2.6 and any Action brought with respect
to the 2007 Plan or by a holder of Membership Interests in connection with any
exercise of Drag-Along Rights pursuant to the Company LLC Agreement;

 



 

(b) severally and not jointly for and against all Losses suffered or incurred
by them in connection with, arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by such Seller in this
Agreement (disregarding for purposes of determining the amount of Losses any
materiality qualification contained in any such representation or warranty but
subject to the dollar limitations set forth in Section 9.4(b)) or, and (ii)
any breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of such Seller in this
Agreement; and

 



 

(c) for so long as there are sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock or cash
in the Indemnification Escrow Fund, the indemnification obligations of each
Seller pursuant to this Section 9.2 may only be satisfied by the release by
the Escrow Agent to Purchasers, pursuant to the terms of the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement, of all or a portion, as applicable, of such shares of Parent
Common Stock or cash in the Indemnification Escrow Fund having a determined
value (determined using the VWAP as of the release date) equal to the amount

Section 9.3 _Indemnification by Purchasers and Parent_. Except with respect to
Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by Article VII, Purchasers and
Parent shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and
their respective Affiliates and their respective directors, officers,

Indemnified Party_ ") for and against all Losses suffered or incurred by them
in connection with, arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Purchasers in this
Agreement (disregarding for purposes of determining the amount of Losses any
materiality or "Purchaser Material Adverse Effect" qualification contained in
any such representation or warranty but subject to the dollar limitations set
forth in Section 9.4(b)) or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement on
the part of Purchasers in this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement; _provided_ that Purchaser shall have no indemnification obligation
in respect of Section 2.2(a)(iii) or Section 2.2(e) and Purchaser 2 shall have
no indemnification obligation in respect of Section 2.2(a)(i) (other than in
respect of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) of the Cash Consideration) or Section

Section 9.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_. (a) No claim may be made or
asserted nor may any Action be commenced against any party hereto for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3, unless written notice of such
claim or Action has been given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying
Party, on or prior to the date on which the representation, warranty or
covenant on which such claim or Action is based ceases to survive as set forth
in Section 9.1.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Article VII or Section 9.2 or 9.3 (other than with
respect to a breach of any of the representations and warranties in the
Indefinite Survival Sections), unless and until the aggregate amount of
indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from the Sellers or Purchasers, as
applicable, pursuant to Article VII or Section 9.2 or 9.3, equals or exceeds
Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), in which case
the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for the amount of all Losses
indemnifiable in excess of such Threshold Amount, excluding, for avoidance of
doubt, the Threshold Amount, it being understood that any Losses not exceeding
Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000) (the " _De Minimis Amount_ ") shall
not be considered for purposes of determining whether the aggregate amount of
Losses under Article VII or Section 9.2 or 9.3 exceeds the Threshold Amount;
_provided_ that any group of Losses, each of which individually is less than
the De Minimis Amount, but all of which relate to a common incident or cause
and which in the aggregate exceed the De Minimis Amount, may all be subject to
claims for indemnification hereunder, subject to exceeding the Threshold
Amount;

 



 

(ii) the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from an
Indemnifying Party for any amounts due as a result of a claim for
indemnification under Article IX (other than with respect to a breach of any
of the representations and warranties in the Indefinite Survival Sections, or
a claim in respect of Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by Article
VII) shall be an amount equal to (A) in the case of Section 9.2, each SellerÂ’s
Selling Percentage of Seventy Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($78,500,000), which amount shall include the amount paid by each Seller out
of the Indemnification Escrow Fund, and (B) in the case of Section 9.3,
Seventy Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($78,500,000); and

 



 

(iii) no party hereto shall have any Liability under any provision of this
Agreement for any special or punitive damages, consequential, incidental or
indirect damages, loss of business reputation, lost opportunity or

 



      
 

 



 

(except as set forth in the following proviso) lost profits; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for purposes of determining any Liability of Sellers under
Section 9.2, Losses may, to the extent reasonably capable of being proven,
include lost profits solely with respect to the loss of the Distribution
Rights in and to any Library Motion Picture and _Breaking Dawn 2_ , in each
case to the extent the same are direct damages; _provided_ , _further_ , that
with respect to all Motion Pictures, direct damages shall include (i) any
costs and expenses of satisfying obligations under or arising in connection
with Foreign Rights Loans to the extent that a liability arises under a
Foreign Rights Loan as a result of a breach of a representation and warranty
of Sellers hereunder and (ii) out of pocket costs necessary to obtain
Distribution Rights (" _DR Cost_ ") in the applicable Motion Picture, provided
that such DR Cost does not exceed the total cost expended in connection with
the applicable Motion Picture; _provided_ _further_ , that for the avoidance
of doubt, direct damages shall not include any damages or other Losses in
respect of derivative productions.

 



 

For avoidance of doubt, none of the limitations set forth in Section 9.4(b)(i)
or 9.4(b)(ii) shall be applicable to liability for indemnification with
respect to Losses relating to or arising out of (A) a breach of any of the
representations and warranties in the Indefinite Survival Sections, (B) in the
case of Section 9.4(b)(ii), a claim in respect of Taxes, which shall be
governed exclusively by Article VII (except that the limitations set forth in
Sections 9.4(b)(i), 9.4(b)(iii), 9.4(c) and 9.4(d) shall apply to any
indemnification by Sellers pursuant to Article VII) other than, in the case of
_Section 9.4(b)(i)_, any indemnification by Sellers with respect to a breach
of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.6(p), (C) a
breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of a party to this Agreement
(including Purchaser 2Â’s obligations to pay the Additional Amount and the
Bonus Amount, as applicable) (D) any Action brought by a holder or former
holder of Unit Appreciation Rights with respect to such Unit Appreciation
Rights or the treatment thereof pursuant to Section 2.6 and any Action brought
with respect to the 2007 Plan or by a holder of Membership Interests in
connection with any exercise of Drag-Along Rights pursuant to the Company LLC
Agreement; _provided_ that the De Minimis Amount shall apply in calculating
Losses with respect to any such Actions brought with respect to any exercise
of such Drag-Along Rights; _provided_ _further_ that in applying such De
Minimis Amount for purposes of this sentence, all individual Actions shall be
aggregated, or (E) any claim in respect of fraud.

 



 

(c) Regardless of anything else contained in this Agreement, except with
respect to any fraud, in absolutely no event shall (i) any Seller be liable in
the aggregate to Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article IX for
more than the total Purchase Price actually received by such Seller under this
Agreement (including for avoidance of doubt the portion of the Share
Indemnification Escrow Amount allocable to such Seller, and with the Share
Consideration, actually received, valued, for this purpose, at the Parent
Common Stock Reference Price) or (ii) Purchasers be liable in the aggregate to
Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article IX for more than the
amount specified in Section 9.4(b)(ii).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, with respect to
any claim for indemnification made pursuant to Section 9.2 or Article VII, the
maximum amount for any indemnifiable Losses for which a Seller may be required
to indemnify and hold harmless a Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be such
SellerÂ’s Selling Percentage of

 



      
 

 



 

such Loss up to the aggregate amount set forth in Section 9.4(b)(ii)(A). By
way of example, if there is an indemnifiable Loss of $10,000,000 and if there
are four Sellers each with a 25% Selling Percentage, then each Seller would be
responsible to pay $2,500,000. By way of further example, if three Sellers
elected to replace the Parent Common Stock in the Indemnification Escrow Fund
with cash and one of the Sellers elected to keep Parent Common Stock in the
Indemnification Escrow Fund and at the time of payment of an indemnifiable
Loss the Parent Common Stock deposited into the Escrow Indemnification Fund
was equal to 50% of the Parent Common Stock Reference Price then the Purchaser
Indemnified Party would be entitled to $2,500,000 from each of the three
Sellers that placed cash in the Indemnification Escrow Fund, $1,250,000 from
the fourth Seller through the sale of such SellerÂ’s Parent Common Stock
deposited into the Indemnification Escrow Fund and $1,250,000 directly from
the fourth Seller outside of the Indemnification Escrow Fund.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims_. (a) Other than with respect
to any Third Party Claim that is provided for in Section 9.5(b), an
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party (or SellersÂ’
Representative if the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified Party) notice
of any matter that an Indemnified Party determines in good faith has given
rise to a right of indemnification under this Article IX, promptly following
(and not later than thirty (30) days of) such determination; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to provide such prompt notice shall not release
the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
such failure. The notice of claim shall describe in reasonable detail the
facts known to the Indemnified Party that it believes gives rise to such
indemnification claim, and the amount, or good faith estimate of the amount,
of Losses arising therefrom.

 



 

(b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, (each, a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") against it that may give rise to a claim for
indemnification under this Article IX, promptly following (and not later than
twenty (20) days of) receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure. The notice of claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts
known to the Indemnified Party that it believes gives rise to such
indemnification claim, and the amount, or good faith estimate of the amount,
of Losses arising therefrom. The Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified PartyÂ’s receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to a Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to assume and
control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through
counsel of its choice (which shall be a recognized law firm with the
experience and resources to defend the Indemnified Party against any such
Third Party Claim), if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the
Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days after the receipt of notice by the
Indemnifying Party, and if it so elects the Indemnifying Party will not be
liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, but the
Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel
and at its own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to assume and control the defense of a Third Party Claim
brought by or

 



       
 

 



 

involving a Governmental Authority. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect
to assume the defense and control of a Third Party Claim pursuant to this
Section 9.5(b), the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control
such defense and the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party
reasonably informed on the progress of such defense.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the actual or potential defendants in,
or targets of, such Third Party Claim include both the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have concluded in good
faith based on the advice of outside counsel that there are or are reasonably
likely to be legal defenses available to it that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or that there exists
or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest, in either case that
would make it inappropriate in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified
Party based on the advise of outside legal counsel for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall use diligent
and good faith efforts in such defense.

 



 

(d) The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in the defense and settlement of any Third Party Claim and make
available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent records,
materials and information in the Indemnified PartyÂ’s possession or under the
Indemnified PartyÂ’s control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control over the defense of such
Third Party Claim as provided in Section 9.5(b), then the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to defend such Third Party Claim, and the portion of any
such claim or demand as to which the defense by the Indemnified Party is
unsuccessful (and the reasonable costs and expenses pertaining to such
defense) shall be a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

 



 

(f) Except if the Indemnified Party has taken over control of any Third Party
Claim pursuant to Section 9.5(c) or Section 9.5(e), the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to take over and assume the control of the defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim. Neither the Indemnifying Party nor the
Indemnified Party may consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, any Third Party Claim, without the prior written consent of the
other, provided that such consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that no such consent of the Indemnified
Party will be needed if any such settlement effected by the Indemnifying Party
obligates the Indemnifying Party to (i) pay or cause to be paid all amounts
arising out of such settlement or judgment, (ii) not encumber any of the
assets of any Indemnified Party or agree to any restriction or condition that
would apply to or adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any
Indemnified PartyÂ’s businesses, and (iii) obtain, as a condition of any such
settlement, a complete release of the Indemnified Party, and(iv) ensure that
such settlement does not include any admission of wrongdoing or misconduct.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Indemnification Net of Insurance Proceeds and Tax Benefits_. With
respect to each indemnification obligation contained in this Article IX, all
Losses shall be (A) net of (i) any third-party insurance proceeds that have
been actually recovered by the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification and (ii) the net Tax benefit actually realized or recovered,
including a reduction in Taxes otherwise payable, by the Indemnified Party
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Losses (it being agreed
that if third-party insurance proceeds or Tax benefit proceeds in respect of
such facts are recovered by the Indemnified Party subsequent to the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s making of an indemnification payment in satisfaction of
its applicable indemnification obligation, such proceeds shall be remitted to
the Indemnifying Party to the extent of the applicable indemnification
payments made) and (B) increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred
by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments
hereunder (grossed up for such increase). The Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall use reasonable efforts to pursue such insurance policies or collateral
sources, and in the event Purchaser Indemnified Parties receive any recovery,
the amount of such recovery shall be applied first, to refund any payments
made by the Indemnifying Parties in respect of indemnification claims pursuant
to this Article IX which would not have been so paid had such recovery been
obtained prior to such payment, and second, any excess to Purchaser
Indemnified Parties.

 



 

Section 9.7 [ _Intentionally Omitted_ ].

 



 

Section 9.8 _Duty to Mitigate_. Purchasers shall, and shall cause the other
Purchaser Indemnified Parties to, use reasonable best efforts to mitigate any
Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by Purchasers or the other Purchaser
Indemnified Parties arising out of any matter for which any Purchaser
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant hereto. Sellers
shall, and shall cause the other Seller Indemnified Parties to, use reasonable
best efforts to mitigate any Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by Sellers
or the other Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of any matter for which
any Seller Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant hereto.
Notwithstanding which party assumes or controls the defense of an
indemnifiable claim pursuant to Section 9.5, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right, but not the obligation (in its sole discretion), and shall be
afforded the opportunity by the Indemnified Party, to make commercially
reasonable efforts, at the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s expense, to minimize or
otherwise mitigate any Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by the
Indemnified Parties arising out of any matter for which such Indemnified Party
is entitled to indemnification pursuant hereto.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Subrogation of Rights_. In the event any payment is made in
respect of Losses pursuant to this Article IX or Article VII, the Indemnifying
Party who made such payment shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment
to any related rights of recovery of the Indemnified Party receiving such
payment against any unaffiliated Third Party.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Tax Indemnity_. Indemnification with respect to Taxes shall be
governed exclusively by Article VII, except as provided in Section 9.4(b)(iii)
and 9.4(c).

 



 

Section 9.11 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for (x) a partyÂ’s right to specific
performance under this Agreement or (y) as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, (a) this Article IX shall be the exclusive remedy of the parties
hereto following the Closing for any Losses arising out of any
misrepresentation or breach of the representations or warranties and covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement of the parties hereto (except as
provided in the last paragraph of Section 9.4(b)), and (b) each of the parties
hereto hereby

 



      
 

 



 

waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action (other than with respect to willful
misconduct or fraud or criminal acts) it may have against the other parties
hereto, arising under or based upon any Law or Governmental Order, other than
the right to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article IX.

 



 

Section 9.12 [ _Intentionally Omitted_ ].

 



 

Section 9.13 _Representations and Warranties of Parent_. Parent hereby
represents and warrants to Sellers, except as (i) set forth in the applicable
sections and subsections of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule or (ii)
disclosed in any report, schedule, form or other document filed with, or
furnished to, the SEC by Parent prior to the date hereof (but excluding any
risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," any
disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or
any other statements that are similarly non-specific or predictive or forward-
looking in nature), as of the date hereof, as follows:

 



 

(a) Parent is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Parent has the
requisite corporate power and authority, and has taken all corporate action
necessary, to authorize this Agreement (to the extent it is a party hereto),
to perform its obligations under Articles VII and IX, and no approval of the
shareholders or any holder of any Equity Interests or Commitments of Parent is
required in connection with ParentÂ’s execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement (to the extent it is a party hereto). This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Parent, and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, Sellers and Purchasers, constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of Parent, enforceable against Parent in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy Exceptions. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent (to the extent
it is a party hereto) will not constitute or result in (a) a breach or
violation of the Organizational Documents of Parent, (b) a breach or violation
of the Icahn Agreements, (c) a breach or violation of, a termination (or right
of termination) or default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or
both would become a default) under, the creation or acceleration of any
obligations under or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of Parent
pursuant to, or require any consent, waiver or approval with respect to, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, Contract, lease, license, permit, franchise
or other instrument or obligation applicable to Parent or any of its
respective Subsidiaries or any of its respective properties or assets, or (d)
conflict with or violate any Law or Governmental Authorization to which Parent
or any of its respective properties or assets is subject. No notices, reports
or other filings are required to be made by Parent with, nor are any
Governmental Authorizations required to be obtained by Parent from, any
Governmental Authority in connection with ParentÂ’s execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement (to the extent Parent is a party hereto). There
are no Actions or Governmental Orders pending or, to ParentÂ’s Knowledge,
Threatened against Parent or its Subsidiaries, except for those that are not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to materially adversely
affect the ability of Parent to timely perform its obligations under Articles
VII and IX of this Agreement.

amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement, or in
the case of a waiver, by the party hereto against whom the waiver is to be
effective. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or
condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. No
failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right.

Company and/or S Representative LLC, on the other hand.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by a party
hereto by operation of Law or otherwise without the express written consent of
the other party hereto. Any purported assignment or delegation not in
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement is void.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.5 _Governing Law;_ _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. (a) This
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware with respect to all Actions arising or
relating to this Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or the
Transactions, or, in the event (but only in the event) that such court does
not have subject matter jurisdiction over such Action, the Superior Court of
the State of Delaware located in the County of New Castle, or, in the event
(but only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such Action, any Federal court of the United States of
America, sitting in the State of Delaware, and, in each case, any appellate
court from any thereof, in any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or the Transactions or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating hereto or thereto, and
each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to
commence any such Action except in such specified courts, (ii) agrees that any
claim in respect of any such Action may be heard and determined in such
specified courts, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such Action in any such specified court, (iv) waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum
to the maintenance of such Action in any such specified court, and (v) to the
extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State
of Delaware, appoints Corporate Trust Company as such partyÂ’s agent in the
State of Delaware for acceptance of legal process and agrees that service made
on any such agent shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon
such party personally within such state. Each of the parties hereto agrees
that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in **** Section 10.1. Nothing
in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party to this Agreement to
serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT, THE INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH
OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT, THE INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 10.5(C).

 



 

Section 10.6 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto recognize and agree
that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not
performed in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and
irreparable harm or damage may be caused for which money damages would not be
an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that, in addition to
any other available remedies, each other party shall be entitled to seek to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement or an
injunction restraining any breach or violation or threatened breach or
violation of the provisions of this Agreement without the necessity of posting
a bond or other form of security. In the event that any Action should be
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall
allege, and each party hereto hereby waives the defense, that there is an
adequate remedy at law.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or electronic mail PDF transmission) in one or more
counterparts, and each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. The electronic facsimile or electronic mail PDF transmission of any
signed original counterpart of this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
delivery of an original counterpart of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Entire Agreement; Severability_. (a) This Agreement, together
with the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Exclusivity Agreement, and the certificates,
documents, instruments and writings that are delivered pursuant hereto and
thereto, constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

(b) If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Disclosure Schedules_. There may be included in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule items and
information, the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof
or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
Article III, Article IV, Article V or to one or more covenants contained in
Article VI, as applicable. Inclusion of such items or information in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, as
applicable, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or agreement that any
such item or information is "material", is outside of the ordinary course of
business, or is reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect or a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or to affect the
interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement. The Company
Disclosure Schedule and the Purchaser

 



      
 

 



 

Disclosure Schedule set forth items of disclosure with specific reference to
the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the items or
information in such Company Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule relates; _provided_ , _however_ , that any information set forth in
one section or subsection pertaining to representations, warranties and
covenants of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule,
as applicable, shall be deemed to apply to each other section or subsection
thereof pertaining to representations, warranties and covenants to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent on its face from a reading of such disclosure
that it is relevant to such other sections or subsections of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, as applicable.

 



 

Section 10.10 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and, except as provided in
Sections 6.5 and 6.6, nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any Person other than Sellers, Purchasers and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Acknowledgement_. Each of Sellers, the Company and the
Purchasers acknowledge and agree that none of Jeff Skoll, the Skoll
Foundation, or Capricorn Management, LLC, individually or collectively, is
party to this Agreement or any agreement provided for herein. Accordingly, the
parties hereto hereby agree that in the event (a) there is any alleged breach
or default by any party under this Agreement or any agreement provided for
herein; or (b) any party hereto has any claim arising from or relating to any
such agreement, no party to this agreement, nor any Person claiming through
such party, shall commence any proceedings or otherwise seek to impose any
liability whatsoever against Jeff Skoll, The Skoll Foundation or Capricorn
Management, LLC by reason of such alleged breach, default or claim.
