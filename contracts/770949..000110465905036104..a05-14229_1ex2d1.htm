# ARTICLE II 
  
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
 OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

  

# 

  

SECTION 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
the holders of any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub or any shares of
capital stock of the Company:

  



  

### (a) Subject to Section 2.1(c), each share of Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company the " _Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or that remain
outstanding pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined
in Section 2.4(a)) (all such shares of Common Stock, the " _Shares_ ") shall
be automatically converted into the right to receive Fifty-Nine Dollars
($59.00) in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of
the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and, subject to Section
2.4(a), each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto except the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) upon the surrender of
such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.

conversion thereof and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each Share owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company shall remain outstanding and continue to exist as shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (d) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par

### 

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if,
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and
outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or a different class by reason of any stock split or combination,
recapitalization _,_ stock dividend, reclassification, redenomination,
adjustment of par value, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, the
Merger Consideration and any other dependent items, as the case may be, shall
be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of the Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action
and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the
Merger Consideration or other dependent item, as applicable, subject to any
further adjustment in accordance with this sentence.

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

SECTION 2.2 _Surrender of Shares_.

  



  

### (a) Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging certificates representing
Shares (" _Certificates_ ") or Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-
Entry Shares_ "), as the case may be, for Merger Consideration. At the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Such funds delivered to the
Exchange Agent are herein referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The
Exchange Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;
_provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Shares entitled to receive such
consideration. Any interest or income provided by such investments shall be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as directed by Parent.

  

### 

  

### (b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in any event within five (5)
days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of
Shares, (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
held by such holder representing such Shares shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
Shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. ** **Each
stockholder, upon surrender by such holder to the Exchange Agent of its
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, together with the letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash (in U.S. dollars) that such stockholder has the right to
receive pursuant to this Article II, after giving effect to any required
withholdings pursuant to Section 2.2(f). ** **No interest shall be paid or
accrue for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. If payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment or issuance that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed, with signatures
guaranteed, and shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such payment or issuance shall have paid to the Exchange
Agent any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment or
issuance of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax either has been paid or
is not applicable. Until so surrendered, each Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the
right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Article II.

  

### 

  

### (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and, subject to Section 2.4(a), no holder of Shares shall have
any rights with respect thereto except the right to receive Merger
Consideration in respect of such Shares pursuant to this Article II, without
interest, and only upon compliance with the applicable provisions of this

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

Article II. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time.
 After the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented
to the Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for
the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article II.

  

### 

  

### (d) At any time following the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to
deliver to it any funds (including any interest or income received with
respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund. To the extent permitted
by applicable Law, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of
shares of Common Stock for any amount properly paid from the Exchange Fund or
otherwise delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  

### 

  

### (e) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement requirements
established by the Exchange Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by
the holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares represented by the
Certificate pursuant to this Article II.

  

### 

  

### (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former
holder of Shares pursuant to this Agreement any amounts as may be required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of this payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing
authority by or on behalf of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall be treated as though it
withheld an appropriate amount of consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any former holder of Shares and paid these cash proceeds to
the appropriate Taxing authority. Such withheld amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or Merger
Sub.

  

### 

  

SECTION 2.3 _Options; Restricted Stock; Company ESPPs_.

  



  

### (a) The Company shall provide that, as of the Effective Time, each option
to purchase Common Stock (" _Company Stock Options_ ") granted under any
stock option plans or other equity-related plans of the Company (the "
_Company Stock Plans_ "), which, in each case, is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested, exercisable or not
exercisable), shall be canceled by the Company, and the holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive promptly following the Effective Time from the
Surviving Corporation, in consideration for such cancellation, an amount
(less applicable withholdings and without interest) equal to the product of
(i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration per share of Common
Stock over (B) the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

Option. In the event that the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option
shall be cancelled without payment therefor and have no further force or
effect.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each share of Common Stock granted subject to vesting or other lapse
restrictions pursuant to any Company Stock Plan (collectively, " _Restricted
Shares_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
vest and become free of such restrictions as of the Effective Time to the
extent provided by the terms thereof (as such plans may be amended prior to
the Effective Time in accordance with the terms hereof) and, at the Effective
Time, the holder thereof shall, subject to this Article II, be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each such Restricted Share
in accordance with Section 2.1, less applicable withholdings and without
interest.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Company shall provide that, as of the Effective Time, any award
of deferred shares of Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan (the
" _Deferred Share Awards_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be canceled by the Company
and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive promptly following the
Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation, in consideration for such
cancellation, an amount (less applicable withholdings, if any, and without
interest) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration per share of
Common Stock, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such Deferred Share Award.

  

### 

  

### (d) The foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3 shall not apply to the
Companys 1987 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 1992 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan or any other plan, program or arrangement intending to qualify as a
stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code (the " _Company ESPPs_ ").
 The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions necessary
to terminate the Company ESPPs effective as of the Effective Time and all
outstanding rights thereunder at the Effective Time, and ensure that no
new offering periods thereunder commence during the period from the date of
this Agreement through the Effective Time.  The offering periods currently
in effect as of the date of this Agreement shall end in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Company ESPP; _provided_ that there will be no
increase in the amount of payroll deductions permitted to be made by the
participants therein during such period; and _provided_ further that, on the
last day of the current offering periods, each participant in the applicable
Company ESPP will be credited with the number of share(s) of Common Stock
purchased for his or her account(s) under the applicable Company ESPP in
respect of the applicable offering period in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company ESPP.

  

### 

  

### (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary in order to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.3.

  

### 

  

SECTION 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

### (a) Shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who have perfected
their rights to dissent from the Merger under the MBCA and who have not
effectively withdrawn or lost such right to dissent under the MBCA as of the
Effective Time (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

converted into, or represent the right to receive, Merger Consideration, and
the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by
the applicable provisions of the MBCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
such stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect or shall effectively
withdraw or lose such right to dissent under the applicable provisions of the
MBCA, such stockholders shares of Common Stock in respect of which the
stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive fair value under the
applicable provisions of the MBCA shall thereupon be deemed to have been
canceled, at the Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration less applicable withholdings and without
interest as compensation for such cancellation.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notice
received by the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any shares of
Common Stock, withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments or
notices served under the applicable provisions of the MBCA relating to
dissenters rights and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to the exercise of dissenters rights under the
applicable provisions of the MBCA.  The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an order, decree,
ruling or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction, make any payment
or other commitment with respect to any such exercise of dissenters rights
or offer to settle or settle any such rights.

standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good
standing) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where any such failure to be in good standing or to have such power or
authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each of the
Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business,
and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the
concept of good standing) in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the conduct of its business or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary,

standing which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. " _Company Material
Adverse Effect_ " means any change, event, circumstance or effect that, taken
as a whole, is or would be materially adverse to the business, assets,
properties, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of the

that those changes have a disproportionate effect on the Company or
its subsidiaries relative to other participants in the industry in which
the Company and its subsidiaries operate), (ii) general changes after the
date of this Agreement in the industry in which the Company and its
subsidiaries operate (except to the extent that those changes have a
disproportionate effect on the Company or its subsidiaries relative to other
participants in such industry), or (iii) the announcement of this Agreement
or of the transactions contemplated hereby, including without limitation
terminations or other negative impacts on relationships with customers,

Company subsidiary, and other than as set forth in Section 3.1 of the

including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known on a timely basis to
the management of the Company (including those members of management who are
responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and
other public disclosure documents) by others within those entities and (B)
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and
Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, and (ii) disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company (A) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and
(B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other

SECTION 3.10 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

### (a) Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true
and complete list of each material Company Plan. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Company Plan_ " shall mean any "employee benefit plan"
(within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), including
"multiemployer plans" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, and any
stock purchase, stock option, severance, employment, change-in-control,
fringe benefit, bonus, incentive, deferred compensation and all other
employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies or other arrangements,
whether or not subject to ERISA (including any funding mechanism therefor now
in effect or required in the future as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), whether formal or informal, oral or written,
whether contained in any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise, (i)
under which (A) any current or former employee, or director, independent
contractor or consultant, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") has any present or future right
(determined as of the date of this Agreement) to benefits and which are
contributed to, sponsored by or maintained by

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (B) the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is reasonably expected to have any present or future liability
(determined as of the date of this Agreement) (other than such benefits as
may be provided by Law or otherwise required by Law to be provided by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries (" _Government Plans_ ")), and (ii)

the most recent determination letter; (iii) any summary plan description and
other written communications (or a description of any oral communications) by

been established and administered in accordance with its terms, and in
compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Laws; (ii) no event has occurred and no condition exists that
would subject the Company or its subsidiaries, either directly or by reason
of their affiliation with any member of their " _Controlled Group_ " (defined
as any organization which is a member of a controlled group of organizations
within the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code) to any
Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or
other applicable Laws; and (iii) no "reportable event" (as such term is
defined in Section 4043 of the Code), no nonexempt "prohibited transaction"
(as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Code) or "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is defined in Section
302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code (whether or not waived)) has
occurred with respect to any Company Plan. Each Company Plan which is intended
to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination letter as to its qualification, and
nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that could
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification. Neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred, or is expected to incur,
any current or projected liability in respect of post-employment or post-
retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for current, former or
retired employees of Company or any of its subsidiaries, and no Company Plan
provides for any such benefits, except as required to avoid an excise Tax
under Section 4980B of the Code or as otherwise required by any other
applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (d) No Company Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA and neither the

threatened, and there exist no facts or circumstances that could reasonably
be expected to give rise to any such action, suit or claim; and (ii)
except as described in Section 3.10(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there is no administrative investigation, audit or other
administrative proceeding by the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue
Service or other Governmental Entity pending or in progress or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, in either case, that could give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (f) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or by reason of the transactions contemplated in Section 2.3 or
Section 6.5 of this Agreement, no material Company Plan exists that, as a
result of the execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this
Agreement, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (whether alone or in connection with any termination of employment
occurring on the Closing Date), will: (i) result in severance pay or any
increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date
of this Agreement under any Company Plan; or (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount
payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the
Company Plans. Except as set forth in Section 3.10(f) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no Company Plan exists that contains terms which could
result in payments under any of the Company Plans which would not be fully
deductible by operation of Section 280G of the Code or Section 162(m) of the
Code.

  

### 

  

### (g) With respect to any plan, program or arrangement that would be a
Company Plan but for the fact that it is maintained outside the jurisdiction

outside the United States (any such Company Plan, a " _Foreign Benefit Plan_
"), except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) all Foreign Benefit
Plans have been established, maintained and administered in compliance with
their terms and all applicable Laws and Orders of any controlling
Governmental Entity or instrumentality; (ii) all Foreign Benefit Plans that
are required to be funded are fully funded to the extent so required by Law
or Order and, with respect to all other Foreign Benefit Plans, adequate
reserves therefore have been established on the accounting statements of the
Company or its applicable subsidiary in accordance with local
generally accepted accounting principles; and (iii) no liability or
obligation of the Company or its subsidiaries exists with respect to such
Foreign Benefit Plans (other than any such Foreign Benefit Plan that is a
Government Plan) that has not been disclosed on Section 3.10(g)(iii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

### 

  

### (h) Each Company Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code has been
operated in material compliance with, and no circumstances exist that would
reasonably be expected to result in any participant in any such Company Plan
incurring any tax under, Section 409A of the Code and for which the Company
is reasonably expected to have material liability and the applicable guidance
thereunder.

of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no labor organization or group of
employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has made a pending demand
for recognition or certification, and there are no representation or
certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding
presently pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing

with the Leased Real Property, the " _Real_

#### 

  

#### (iv) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any

Parent or its affiliates); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if requested to do
so by a third party who has contacted the Company to inform it that it
desires to make an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, but would be
unable to do so without a waiver or modification of its existing standstill
provisions, the Company may waive, modify or fail to enforce such standstill
provisions (A) if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined
in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its

faith (A) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its

Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal (as defined below) from the party that made the applicable
Acquisition Proposal;

provisions of Section 6.4(a); and

timing, and similar aspects of, and conditions to, the proposal, the
likelihood of obtaining necessary financing and the person making the
proposal, and the Board of Directors of the Company determines, in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, is more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal).

other Contract with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,

stockholders of the Company which is limited to the statements described in
Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act in connection with the commencement of a
tender offer or exchange offer with respect to the Common Stock shall not be
deemed to constitute a Change in Company Recommendation.

  

### 

  

### (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 6.4(d), if, at any time prior
to the approval of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, the Company
receives an unsolicited Superior Proposal and the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable
Law, following the expiration of the Notice Period (as defined below) the
Companys Board of Directors may (x) effect a Change in Company
Recommendation and/or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_  that the Board

written agreements relating to the transaction that

  

#### 

  

#### 35   

     
   

  

#### 

  

#### constitutes such Superior Proposal, including the identity of the person
making such Superior Proposal;

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) during the three business day period following receipt of such
notice by Parent (or longer period if extended by the mutual agreement of the
Company and Parent) (the " _Notice Period_ "), the Company and the Company
Representatives have negotiated in good faith with Parent and the Parent
Representatives (if Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such
modifications to the terms of this Agreement as would make the Acquisition
Proposal no longer a Superior Proposal;

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) following receipt of any proposal with respect to modifications to
the terms of this Agreement by Parent, which proposal must be made prior to
the expiration of the Notice Period, the Companys Board of Directors has
again determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, and after taking into account any such modifications proposed by
Parent, that failure to effect a Change in Company Recommendation in response
to such Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal would reasonably
be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to stockholders
under applicable Law; and

  

#### 

  

#### (v) in the event of any termination of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to clause (y) of this Section 6.4(e), the Company pays the

negotiations with any persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
