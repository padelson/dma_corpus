partners (" _Parent_ ") and Mario II Finance Corp., a Delaware corporation and

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") and

directors of Merger Sub have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into
the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation in the merger (the
" _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement; and

representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in

satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement, by electronic exchange
of documents and signatures, or at such other place, time and date as the
parties to this Agreement may agree in writing (the actual time, and date of
the Closing being referred to herein   as the " _Closing Date_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "

acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings,
recordings or publications required under the DGCL in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with, and accepted for record by, the office of the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, or at
such later time or date as the Company and Parent shall agree in writing and
specify in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with applicable Law (the

Time_ ").

with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (subject to Section 7.11).

2.2 _The Bylaws_. The by-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the "

2 ARTICLE IV

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;_

 

 _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, the
holder of any capital stock of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the "
_Shares_ ") of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the "
_Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including each outstanding restricted share granted under the Stock
Plans) other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct
or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, in each case not held on behalf
of third parties, (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined below), and (iii) Shares
owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company (each Share referred to in clause (i) through (iii) above being an "
_Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive $140 in cash (the " _Per
Share Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. At the Effective Time, all
of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated
Share represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") formerly
representing any Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares and shall represent only the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of
such Shares formerly represented thereby, without interest.

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall cease
to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to the right of the Record Holder
of any Dissenting Shares to receive the payment to which reference is made in
Section 4.2(f) with respect to such Dissenting Shares. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Record Holder_ " means, with respect to any Shares
(whether represented by Certificate or Book-Entry Shares), a Person who was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the holder of record of such Shares.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, any certificates
representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

 



3 4.2 _Payment_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent, which
is a U.S.-based nationally recognized bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
Record Holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available
funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make the aggregate payments under
Section 4.1(a) for the Shares other than the Excluded Shares (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), and, in connection
therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. If a Dissenting Stockholder
effectively withdraws its demand for, or loses its, appraisal rights pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent
shall, reasonably promptly thereafter, make available or cause to be made
available to the Paying Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the number of Dissenting Shares for which the Dissenting
Stockholder has withdrawn its demand for, or lost its, appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the Per Share Merger
Consideration. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1.0 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available). Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the aggregate amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly
returned to the Surviving Corporation or Parent (at Parents election). To the
extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments such
that the Exchange Fund diminishes below the level required for the Paying
Agent to make prompt cash payment under Section 4.1(a) or the Exchange Fund
otherwise is insufficient to make the payments required under Section 4.1(a),
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly deposit,
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make
such aggregate payments under Section 4.1(a).

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. Reasonably promptly (and in any event, within
three (3) business days) after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (or cause to be mailed) to each Record
Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) (x) a letter of transmittal for
use in collecting the amount to which such Record Holder is entitled as a
result of the Merger, such letter of transmittal to be in such customary form
as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree and (y) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

 



4 (ii) _Payment for Shares_. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent by any Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with its instructions, and
surrender to the Paying Agent of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (if any)
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)), such Record
Holder shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange Fund a cash amount equal
to the number of such Shares multiplied by the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and, if applicable, the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable as provided above. Payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Risk of loss of
and title to any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will pass only upon proper
delivery as provided above. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares
represented by a Certificate that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, a check for any cash to be delivered upon compliance with the
procedures described above may be issued to the transferee if the applicable
letter of transmittal is accompanied by all documents reasonably required by
the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. The Per
Share Merger Consideration, paid in full with respect to any Share in
accordance with the terms hereof, shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Share.

(iii) _Special Payment Procedures for DTC_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to establish customary
procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ")
to ensure that (x) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (New York
time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its
nominee on the Closing Date an amount in cash from the Exchange Fund in
immediately available funds equal to the number of Shares held of record by
DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by
the Per Share Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and
(y) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing
Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first
business day after the Closing Date an amount in cash from the Exchange Fund
in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Person presents
to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Paying Agent any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares or any transfer instructions relating to Shares cancelled in
the Merger, such Person shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal and
related instructions referred to in Section 4.2(b)(i) and instructed to comply
with the instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled pursuant to
this Article IV.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that
remains undistributed to the Record

 



5  Holders of Shares for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder of Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws) for payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration for such Shares upon compliance with the instructions in the
form of letter of transmittal referred to in Section 4.2(b)(i), without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable
to any Record Holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.
If any Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on
which any cash payable in respect of such Shares would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such cash shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit),
general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity
of any kind or nature, and any permitted successors and assigns of such
Person.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit (satisfactory to the Paying Agent, acting reasonably)
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent or Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms
as may be required by the Paying Agent or Parent as indemnity against any
Action that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount equal
to the number of Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen, mutilated
or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon. When used in this Agreement, " _Action_ " shall
mean any action, claim, complaint, investigation, audit, petition, charge,
suit, grievance, arbitration, hearing or other proceeding, whether civil or
criminal, at law or in equity, by or before any Governmental Entity.

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Shares included in clauses (i) and (iii) of the
definition of Excluded Shares) and which are held by a stockholder who did not
vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "),
shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost its right to appraisal under the DGCL. If
any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right,

 



6  such holders Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such Share, in
accordance with Section 4.1(a), without interest. The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt written notice and a copy of any written demands for
appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to
Company stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal by Company stockholders under the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or
approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable in respect of Shares cancelled in the Merger or pursuant to
Section 4.3 such amounts required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts

issuable pursuant to such Company Performance RSU Award upon attainment of
the target level of performance applicable to such Company Performance RSU
Award (the " _Company Vested Performance RSU Shares_ "), and, at the Effective
Time, the Company Vested Performance RSU Shares shall entitle the holder of
such Company Performance RSU Award to receive an amount in cash (subject to
applicable withholding) equal to (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration
multiplied by (B) the number of Company Vested Performance RSU Shares
attributable to such Company Performance RSU Award (such amount, the "

RSU Awards, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be fully vested (except that any Company
Other Equity Award that is subject to performance-based vesting shall vest at
the target level of performance), and, at the Effective Time, the vested

Amounts, aggregate Company Performance RSU Amounts, aggregate RSU Amounts and
aggregate Company Equity Amounts, and the term " _Equity Award Amount_ " means
the portion of the aggregate Option Amounts, Company Performance RSU Amounts,
RSU Amounts or Company Equity Amounts (as applicable) payable to any holder of
a Company Equity Award. Except as otherwise required under the terms of the
applicable award or as necessary to avoid the imposition of any additional
taxes or penalties on any Equity Award Amount pursuant to Section 409A of the
Code, all amounts payable pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall be paid as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, without interest.

 



8 (c) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after
the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be
required to deliver Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company
to any person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Equity Awards or
otherwise.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, Parent shall make a cash contribution to the
Surviving Corporation in immediately available funds sufficient to permit the
Surviving Corporation to make the payments required under this Section 4.3,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make such payments as promptly as
practicable thereafter. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay through a payroll agent appointed by Parent the applicable Equity Award
Amounts, if any, to the holders of Company Equity Awards, subject to Section
4.2(g).

 

4.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer or other similar transaction, the Per Share
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change so as
to provide the Record Holders the same economic benefit as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event and as so adjusted shall, from and after
the date of such event, be the Per Share Merger Consideration. Nothing in
this Section 4.4 shall be construed to permit any party to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this
Agreement.

properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where any such failure to have such power and authority or to be so
organized, qualified, in good standing or to have such power or authority,
individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect (as defined below).

 

(b) The Company has, prior to the date hereof, made available to Parent
complete and correct copies of the Companys certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, each as amended to the date hereof, and each as so delivered is in

indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management
and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of securities,
partnership interests, other ownership interests, by contract or otherwise,
and (iii) " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any change, effect,
event, development, occurrence, or circumstance that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than any change, effect,
event, development, occurrence, or circumstance relating to (i) the economy
or securities, credit, capital or financial markets in general (including any
general suspension of trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market or any other stock
exchange), (ii) the economic, business, financial, technological
or regulatory environment generally affecting the industries in which the
Company operates, (iii) changes in Law or applicable accounting regulations or
principles or interpretations thereof, (iv) any change, in and of itself, in
the Companys stock price or trading volume, any change, in and of itself, in
the ratings or ratings outlook for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or

revenue or earnings projections for any period ending on or after the date
hereof (it being understood that the underlying causes of such change or
failure shall not be excluded by this clause (iv)), (v) an act of terrorism or
an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or war (whether or not declared) or
the existence, occurrence or continuation of any natural disasters or any
national or international calamity or crisis, (vi) (A) announcement or
pendency of this Agreement or (B) the entry into this Agreement or the

or threatened adverse change in, the relationship of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with its customers, employees, financing sources, suppliers or
business partners

 



10  resulting or arising therefrom; _provided_ that when used (1) to qualify any
representation or warranty of the Company set forth in Section 5.4, Section
5.9(b) or Section 5.14(f) and (2) in the conditions to the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 8.2(a)(i), "Company Material
Adverse Effect" shall be read without giving effect to this clause (vi)(B) to
the extent that the required action relates to the obligation of the Company
under Section 7.1(a) or the action would result in a breach of the
representation set forth in Section 5.4, Section 5.8(f), Section 5.9(b),
Section 5.11 or Section 5.14(f), (vii) the failure to obtain any approvals or
consents from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions

Transactions, (ix) any actions or claims made or brought by any of the current
or former stockholders of the Company (or on their behalf or on behalf of the
Company, but in any event only in their capacities as current or former
stockholders) against the Company or any of its directors, officers or
employees arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or (x) actions (or
omissions) of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken (or not taken) with the
prior written consent or at the prior written request of Parent; _provided_ ,
that changes, effects, events, developments, occurrences or circumstances

to be a Company Material Adverse Effect if and to the extent such change,
effect, event, development, occurrence or circumstance has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a disproportionate adverse effect on the
Company and its Subsidiaries, as compared to other companies operating in the
industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

with a fair market value in excess of $10,000,000. As of the date hereof,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to make any

5.5 _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act from January 1, 2011 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the forms, statements,
certifications, reports and documents filed or furnished since the Applicable
Date and those filed or furnished on or subsequent to the date hereof,
including any supplements, modifications or amendments thereto made prior to
the date hereof, the " _Company Reports_ "). Each of the Company Reports, at
the time of its filing or being furnished, or, if supplemented, modified or
amended by a subsequent filing with the SEC since the time of filing but prior
to the date hereof, as of the date of the most recent such
supplement, modification or amendment, complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements

 



14  of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable to the Company Reports, including any applicable
accounting requirements. As of their respective dates (or, if supplemented,
modified or amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such
supplement, modification or amendment), the Company Reports did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. As of the date hereof, none of the Subsidiaries of the Company is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) under the
Exchange Act. As of the date hereof, there are no material outstanding or
unresolved comments received from the SEC or the staff of the SEC with
respect to any of the Company Reports.

(b) Since the Applicable Date, subject to any applicable grace periods, the
Company has been and is in compliance with (A) the applicable provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (B) the applicable rules and regulations of the
NASDAQ, except in each case for any failures to be in compliance that
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Transactions by the Company.

(c) The Company has established, implemented and maintains "disclosure
controls and procedures" and "internal control over financial reporting" (as
such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act and as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to provide reasonable assurances that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The chief executive officer
and chief financial officer of the Company have made all certifications
required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Rule 13a15
under the Exchange Act, and the statements contained in all such
certifications were as of their respective dates complete and correct. The
Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the Companys most
recently completed fiscal year, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent
evaluation of its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer
prior to the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of
the Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information or
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting.

 

(d) Since the Applicable Date, except as would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
Knowledge of the

 



15  Company, any director, officer, or auditor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has received any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices.

(e) Each of the consolidated balance sheets and statements of stockholders
equity included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports
(including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of income,
statements of comprehensive income and statements of cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents, in all material respects, the net
income (or loss) and cash flows, as the case may be, of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments). Each
such statement has been prepared in all material respects in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") consistently
applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein or as
permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC. None of the Subsidiaries of
the Company is required to file periodic reports with the SEC.

 

5.6 _Absence of Certain Changes_.

 

(a) Since June 30, 2014, the Company and its Subsidiaries (x) have conducted
their respective businesses in all material respects in accordance with the
ordinary course of these businesses, except in connection with this Agreement

directors, officers, employees, controlled Affiliates, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any

information or data to any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry that may reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal,

(E) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing. Promptly (but in any event
within two (2) business days) after the date hereof, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their respective Representatives to request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished in
connection therewith and immediately terminate all physical and electronic
dataroom access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives
(other than any Person with whom the Company is in negotiations or discussions
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section 7.2(b)).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be permitted to reimburse or
agree to reimburse the expenses of any other person (or group of persons) who
makes an Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time from the date hereof and prior to, but not after, the time the
Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if the Company receives a written
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal from any Person then (A) the Company and its
Representatives may provide information in response to a request therefor by
such Person if the Company receives from such Person (or has received from
such Person), prior to providing such information, an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to
the Company than those contained in the Company Confidentiality Agreement
(and the Company shall have provided written notice to Parent of the execution
and delivery of such a confidentiality agreement); _provided_ that such
confidentiality agreement shall not be required to contain a standstill
provision; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall promptly (but in

42  available to Parent or Merger Sub, (B) the Company and its Representatives
may engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and
(C) after having complied in all respects with Section 7.2(d), the Company
and the Company Board may adopt, approve or recommend or propose to adopt,
approve or recommend (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if
and only if (y) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, in
the case of an Acquisition Proposal, prior to taking any action described in
clause (A) or (B) the Company Board determines in good faith based on the
information then available and after consultation with its outside financial
advisor and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal ( _provided_ , that the Company may request clarifications
of the terms and conditions of a written unsolicited Acquisition Proposal
prior to such a determination so as to determine whether such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal) and the Company shall have notified Parent of such
determination and (z) in each such case referred to in clause (C) above, prior
to taking any action described in clause (C), the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal (taking into account any
adjustment or revisions made by Parent in response to such Acquisition
Proposal). The Company shall not release or waive any "standstill" agreement
to which it is a party; _provided_ , that the Company may release or waive
any "standstill" agreement to which it is a party if, prior to such release or
waiver, the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal counsel that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ that the Company shall advise Parent
orally and in writing no later than 24 hours prior to any such release or
waiver that the Company shall provide such release or waiver.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement:

respect to a merger, consolidation, tender offer, recapitalization, share
exchange, business combination, acquisition or similar transaction or series
of transactions involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (A) the
direct or indirect acquisition of more than 20% of the total voting power of
the capital stock or other ownership interests of the Company, (B) more than
20% of the consolidated assets (based on the fair market value thereof,
determined by the Company Board in good faith) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or (C) pursuant to which any Person or group (or the
shareholders of any Person) would own, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of
the equity securities of the Company or of the surviving entity in a merger
involving the Company or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such surviving entity or (ii) any other _bona fide_ proposal or
offer involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which, if consummated,
would result in a direct or indirect acquisition of more than 20% of the
total voting power of the capital stock or other ownership interests, or more
than 20% of the consolidated assets (based on the fair market value thereof,
determined by the Company Board in good faith), of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in one transaction or a series of transactions, in each case
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



43 " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Acquisition Proposal that if
consummated would result in a third Person or group (or the shareholders of
any Person) owning, directly or indirectly, (i) 50% or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company or of the surviving entity in a merger
involving the Company or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such surviving entity or (ii) 50% or more (based on the fair market
value thereof, as determined by the Company Board in good faith) of the assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including capital stock of the
Subsidiaries of the Company, and by means of any tender offer for the capital
stock of, or any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, binding share exchange or
similar transaction involving, any Subsidiary of the Company), taken as a
whole, that the Company Board has determined in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, would result in a
transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders taking into account
all relevant factors (including the timing, likelihood of consummation,
ability to finance, legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal) than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (taking into
account any adjustment or revisions made by Parent in response to such
Acquisition Proposal or otherwise).

 

(d) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 7.2, the Company Board shall
not:

 

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify, change or modify (or propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify, change or modify), in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation or fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement;

 

(ii) adopt, approve, recommend or endorse or approve (or publicly propose or
publicly resolve to adopt, approve, recommend or endorse) an Acquisition
Proposal;

(iii) make any recommendation to the stockholders of the Company with respect
to a tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal
other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange
Act or fail to recommend against acceptance of such a tender offer or
exchange offer, including by taking no position with respect to acceptance,
within ten (10) business days after commencement (any of the actions or
failures described in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or this clause (iii)
being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ");
_provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, a statement that the Company
Board recommends against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer but, in
accordance with Section 7.2 of this Agreement, is engaging in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such tender or exchange offer, shall not
be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;

(iv) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement or a
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or agreement in principle with
respect thereto (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
7.2(b)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ "); or

(v) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(a).

 



44 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to, but not after, the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the
Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (a " _Company Change of
Recommendation_ ") and, in the event of a Company Change of Recommendation
involving any Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined in
its good faith judgment constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may
also cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(a)
of this Agreement in connection with accepting such Acquisition Proposal as
contemplated herein; _provided_ , that prior to any Company Change of
Recommendation or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(a) of
this Agreement in connection with accepting such Acquisition Proposal as
contemplated herein:

(A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger
Sub, at least ninety-six hours in advance, of its intention to effect a
Company Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.3(a) (it being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by
the Company nor the public announcement that the Company Board has delivered
such notice shall constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), which
notice, if the intended Company Change of Recommendation is not the result of
a Superior Proposal, shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons for such
Company Change of Recommendation and, if concerning an intended Company Change
of Recommendation that is the result of a Superior Proposal, shall specify the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and the material
terms thereof;

(B) during the ninety-six hour period after providing such notice and prior to
effecting such Company Change of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.3(a), the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger
Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate)
with respect to adjustments proposed by Parent and Merger Sub to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company not to effect a
Company Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.3(a) in response to such an Acquisition Proposal; and

(C) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement offered by Parent in a written, binding offer and (x) if the
intended Company Change of Recommendation is the result of such an Acquisition
Proposal, shall have determined in good faith after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were
to be given effect and (y) if the intended Company Change of Recommendation
is not the result of such an Acquisition

 



45  Proposal, shall have determined in good faith after consultation with its
outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel that failure to effect a
Company Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law if such
changes were to be given effect;

 

 _provided_ , that, if the intended Company Change of Recommendation is the
result of such an Acquisition Proposal or in the case of a termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(a), in the event of any material
revision to such Acquisition Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
increase in purchase price shall be deemed a material revision), the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and Merger Sub
and to comply with the requirements of clauses (A) through (C) of this Section
7.2(d) with respect to such new written notice, except that the deadline for
such new written notice and the negotiation period shall be reduced to forty-
eight hours before the Company Change of Recommendation or termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(a) (rather than the ninety-six hours
otherwise contemplated by this Section 7.2(d)).

(e) Subject to the Companys compliance with Section 7.2(d), nothing contained
in this Section 7.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company
Board from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or
state Law, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act, or (ii)
making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

of any of the applicable actions or the applicable proposal or documents
being delivered, the Company shall (i) notify Parent that it has provided any
nonpublic information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) notify
Parent it has entered into discussions or negotiations as provided in Section
7.2(b) and (iii) provide to Parent a copy of any proposals with respect to, or
draft agreements or similar documents to effect any, Acquisition Proposal
delivered to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including the identity
of the party or parties making such Acquisition Proposal. In addition, the
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt basis,
of the status and material terms of any proposals or offers (including by
providing copies of any amendments or other documents thereto) and the status
of any discussions and negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company hereby agrees that it shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries
to, enter into any agreement that prohibits or restricts it from providing to
Parent the information contemplated by this Section 7.2(f) or complying with
Section 7.2(d).

 

7.3 _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably
possible following the date hereof, a proxy statement in preliminary form
relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, including

shall include, subject to Section 7.2(d), the Company Recommendation.

 



46 (b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of
the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of
any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for any amendment or supplement
thereto or for additional information and shall promptly provide to Parent
copies of all correspondence between the Company and/or any of its
Representatives and the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (with the
reasonable assistance of Parent) to promptly provide responses to the SEC
with respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the
staff of the SEC as soon as reasonably possible after the date hereof. Parent
shall provide to the Company such information concerning Parent and Merger Sub
as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy
Statement and shall otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the
Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and resolution of comments
referred to herein. The Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to
be mailed as promptly as reasonably possible after the date the SEC staff
advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may
commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

 

(c) Subject to applicable Law, notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated
above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other
required filings (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response and shall in good faith
consider for inclusion in such document or response comments reasonably
proposed by Parent.

as promptly as reasonably possible after the date of mailing of the Proxy
Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, with the
record date and meeting date of the Company Stockholders Meeting to be
selected after reasonable consultation with Parent; _provided_ , that, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting solely (i) with the written consent of Parent; (ii) due
to the absence of a quorum (in which case the Company shall, and shall cause
its proxy solicitor to, solicit the presence, in person or by proxy, of a
quorate number of shares expeditiously, it being understood that time shall be
of the essence); (iii) to solicit additional votes in order to obtain the
Requisite Company Vote; or (iv) to the extent the Company Board determines
failure to postpone or adjourn such meeting would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , that with respect to items (i)
through (iv) above, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
reconvene and hold a Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably
possible. Subject to the right of the Company Board to make a Company Change
of Recommendation in accordance with Section 7.2, the Company Board shall
recommend adoption of this Agreement and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to solicit the Requisite Company Vote.

applicable Antitrust Law, and any notice or other filings with the Committee
on Foreign Investment in the United States (" _CFIUS_ "). Parent and the
Company each shall (i) file (and cause its Affiliates to file), or cause to be

and (iii) act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in

under any Antitrust Laws. Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange
of information, Parent and the Company shall provide outside legal counsel
for the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any
proposed notifications or filings and any written communications or
submissions, and with respect to any such notification, filing, written
communication or submission, any documents submitted therewith to any

connection with the Proxy Statement or any other analysis, statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the Transactions, including under
the HSR Act, the EUMR, any other applicable Antitrust Laws and any applicable
filings with CFIUS or any other Governmental Entity; _provided_ , that

confidentiality concerns and (iii) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) _Status_. Subject to applicable Law, to the extent reasonably practicable,
the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the Transactions, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices and other written communications
and summaries of oral communications (other than those pertaining to
scheduling or ministerial matters) received by Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions. Except as
required by Law or by a Governmental Entity, neither the Company nor Parent
shall permit, to the extent reasonably practicable, any of its officers or any
other Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect
to the Merger and the other Transactions unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

 

(d) _Antitrust Matters_.

 

(i) Subject to the terms of this Section 7.5, each of the Company and Parent
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain from any
Governmental Entity all consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or orders required to be obtained by such party under Antitrust
Laws or to avoid the entry or enactment of any permanent, preliminary or
temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination,
judgment, or investigation relating to any Antitrust Law that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the proffer and
agreement by Parent of its willingness to sell or otherwise dispose of, or
hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly effect the sale, disposal
and holding separate of, such assets, categories of assets or businesses or
other segments of the Company or Parent or eithers respective Subsidiaries
(and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant
Governmental Entity giving effect thereto) if such action is necessary to
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened
issuance or enactment of any order, decree, decision, determination, or
judgment that would restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Merger by any Governmental Entity.

(ii) In addition to the foregoing, Parent shall be required to take all such
other lawful actions necessary as promptly as reasonably possible (taking
into account reasonable discussions and negotiations) to obtain from any
Governmental Entity

 



49  all consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or
orders required to be obtained under Antitrust Laws or to avoid the entry or
enactment of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other
order, decree, decision, determination, judgment, or investigation relating to
any Antitrust Law that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to sell or
otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly
effect the sale, disposal and holding separate of, such assets, categories of
assets or businesses or other segments of the Company or Parent or eithers
respective Subsidiaries (and the entry into agreements with, and submission to
orders of, the relevant Governmental Entity giving effect thereto).

 

(iii) Each of the Company and Parent shall, in the event that any permanent,
preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination, or decree is entered or issued or threatened to be entered or
issued that would make consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, prevent, enjoin
or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, use, subject to the last paragraph in this
Section 7.5(d), their respective reasonable best efforts (including commencing
or defending litigation) to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend,
prevent, eliminate or remove such injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination, or decree so as to permit such consummation as promptly as
reasonably possible.

 

Nothin _g_ in this Agreement shall require or be construed to require Parent
or its Subsidiaries to commit to any undertaking, divestiture, license
or hold separate or similar arrangement or conduct of business arrangement or
to terminate or modify any relationships, rights or obligations or to do any
other act to obtain any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or orders required to be obtained under Antitrust Laws or to
avoid the entry or enactment of any permanent, preliminary or temporary
injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination, judgment, or
investigation relating to any Antitrust Law, to the extent such commitment,
divestiture, license, hold separate, arrangement, termination, modification or
action, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect (after giving effect to the proceeds and other
consideration received with respect to any required divestitures or other
actions) on the combined business or financial condition of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and the life science tools and performance materials
businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (an " _Antitrust
MAE_ "). Nothing in this Section 7.5 shall require the Company, Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect
to their business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or
action is conditioned upon Closing.

(e) _CFIUS_. In furtherance of the other undertakings and limitations on
undertakings pursuant to this Section 7.5, each of the Company and Parent

contemplated hereby; (B) as promptly as reasonably possible provide all
necessary information within their respective control for the Joint Notice
and (C) use reasonable best

 



50  efforts to provide as promptly as reasonably possible all necessary
information which is not within such partys control, in each case, to
complete the Joint Notice in a timely manner and to timely respond to any
requests by CFIUS for additional information, and they shall keep each other
generally apprised of communications with, and requests for additional
information from CFIUS, and use their respective reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Completion of CFIUS Process as promptly as reasonably possible
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, may require Parent and its Subsidiaries to
offer or commit to an undertaking, divestiture, license or hold separate or
similar arrangement or conduct of business arrangement or to terminate or
modify any relationships, rights or obligations that is consistent with the
standard of reasonable best efforts).

 

(f) Parent shall have the right to direct all matters with any Governmental
Entity in a manner consistent with its obligations hereunder (including
Section 7.5(d)(ii)) relating to any antitrust, competition or CFIUS matters.
In addition, Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition
or CFIUS clearances and shall take the lead in all meetings and
communications with any Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining any
necessary antitrust, competition or CFIUS clearances, in each case, in a
manner consistent with its obligations hereunder (including Section
7.5(d)(ii)).

(g) No party shall voluntarily extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or
any antitrust or competition law or with respect to CFIUS or enter into any

delay such consent.

(h) From the date hereof through the earlier of the termination of this

reasonably be expected to materially delay or impede the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(i) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7.5 shall not limit or
modify its rights under Section 7.2. The obligations of the Company with
respect to the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Proxy Statement shall be
governed by Section 7.3 and 7.4 and not this Section 7.5. This Section 7.5
shall not apply to any actions related to the Financing as to which Sections
7.13 and 7.14 shall apply exclusively in determining the parties obligations
with respect thereto.

 

7.6 _Access and Reports_.

shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers and other authorized
Representatives of Parent, potential sources of capital and any rating
agencies and prospective lenders reasonable access, during normal business
hours throughout the period from the date hereof to the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, to its
employees (including officers), properties, books, contracts, personnel files
and records and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) promptly furnish to Parent all

 



51  information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may

material whose distribution is restricted by the U.S. government, or (iii) to
disclose any information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would
waive the protection of attorney-client privilege; _provided_ , that, with
respect to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) if such information cannot be disclosed
pursuant to such clauses, the Company shall disclose as much of such
information as is practicable (through redactions, summaries or
other appropriate means) without violating the applicable restrictions on
disclosure of such information or waiving such privilege. All such information
shall be governed by the terms of the Company Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent shall
give prompt written notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain
such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, (ii) of any Actions commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or otherwise affecting such party of any of
its Subsidiaries which relate to the transactions contemplated by this

reasonably likely to, constitute a material breach of this Agreement by the
other party; _provided_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 7.6(b) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

7.7 _Stock Exchange De-listing; Exchange Act Deregistration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall provide reasonable cooperation to Parent and
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper

NASDAQ and SEC to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the
Common Stock from the NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Common Stock under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

7.8 _Publicity_. The parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the Merger shall be in the form agreed to by the
parties. The Company and Parent each shall consult with each other prior to
issuing any other press releases or otherwise making public announcements
(unless and until a Company Change of Recommendation has occurred or in
connection with Section 7.2(d)) with respect to the Merger and the other
Transactions with respect thereto, and, to the extent practicable, none of
the parties or their Affiliates shall issue any such press release or make any
such public announcement prior to obtaining the other partys written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except that no such consent shall be required to the extent prohibited by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange or by the written request of any
Governmental Entity. This Section 7.8 shall not apply to any announcement,
document or publication in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, Superior
Proposal, Company Change of Recommendation or any amendment to the terms
hereof proposed by Parent that would increase the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

 



52 7.9 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
12-month anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "),
or if shorter, during the period of employment, provide to each individual who
is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing, (i) base compensation, bonus opportunities and annual incentive
opportunities (short and long term) which, in the aggregate, are no less
favorable than the base compensation, bonus opportunities and annual incentive
opportunities (short and long term) provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) employee benefits that
are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to either (x) those provided
to such employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the

in effect at the date hereof, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event), without any
amendment or modification, other than any amendment or modification required
to comply with applicable Law.

 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to cause any
employee benefit plans in which the individuals who are employed by the

entitled to participate following the Closing to take into account for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and benefit accrual
thereunder (other than for benefit accruals under defined benefit pension
plans, retiree medical programs or other retiree welfare benefit programs),
service by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service
were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under a

employee benefit plans maintained for the benefit of the individuals who are
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing, to (i) waive any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition

comparable plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) give effect, in
determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket

Effective Time, the terms and conditions of employment for any individual who

subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be governed by such
Collective Bargaining Agreement until its expiration, modification or
termination in accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

provided in Section 7.9(b), prohibit Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
their respective Affiliates from amending or terminating any Benefit Plan in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law, (ii) require Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to keep any person employed for any period of time, or

of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification

Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, or will,
indemnify and hold harmless (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall also advance expenses to) the Indemnified Parties, against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or Liabilities incurred in connection with any
Actions, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or related to such Indemnified Parties service as a director, officer or
employee of the Company or its

 



54  Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at the request of the
Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the fullest extent provided as
of the date hereof in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, comparable
governing documents or existing contractual arrangements of the Company or
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that any person to whom any funds are advanced
pursuant to the foregoing must provide a written undertaking to repay such
advances if it is finally determined by a body of competent authority that
such person is not entitled to indemnification.

do so, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain and fully pay
the premium for the extension of (i) the directors and officers liability

policies, and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies, in each case, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of Liability
that are at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with
respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement,
act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of
him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , that in no event
shall the Company or Surviving Corporation expend for such policies pursuant
to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the last annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Company or Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as reasonably possible for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 7.11.

to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with

unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), including using commercially reasonable efforts to:

 

(i) furnish Parent and its financing sources with the following information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries (it being understood and agreed
that such material shall be deemed furnished if it is filed by the Company

the prior year), prepared in accordance with GAAP and reviewed as per
applicable "U.S. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards" (the " _Unaudited
Consolidated Interim Financial Statements_ ") as soon as reasonably possible
after the end of such interim period, consistent with the timing achieved by
the Company in respect of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for such period in
2014, but in no event later than the date the Company is required to file
with the SEC its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the applicable interim

Unaudited Consolidated Interim Financial Statements,

in each case of (A) through (E) above together with any report (unqualified,
if reasonably obtainable) of an independent registered public accounting firm

Credit Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2012, as amended on December 2, 2013, by
and among the Company, as borrower, certain lenders party thereto (as defined
therein) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent
(the " _Existing Credit Facility_ ") and releasing Liens and the pledges of
collateral securing such Existing Credit Facility and (ii) any other
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is repayable by its
terms in connection with the Merger at or immediately following the Effective
Time, in each case to take effect at the Effective Time (it being understood
that the Company shall have no obligation to pay or discharge any such
indebtedness prior to the Effective Time) or otherwise as a result of the
Merger, to take effect at the Effective Time (it being understood that the
Company shall have no obligation to pay or discharge any such indebtedness
prior to the Effective Time).

 

(b) The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos in connection with the
Financing; _provided_ , that such logos are used in a manner that is not
intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.13, until the
Effective Time occurs, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor
any of their respective Representatives shall:

 

(i) be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee under the
Financing;

 

(ii) be required to pass resolutions to approve or authorize the Financing (or

in connection with the Financing.

 



58 (d) Parent shall promptly, upon written request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all (i) reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including
reasonable attorneys and accountants fees) incurred by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with their respective obligations pursuant to,
and in accordance with, this Section 7.13, and (ii) damages, losses, costs,
Liabilities or expenses suffered or reasonably incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used in
connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) and all other actions taken by the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives pursuant to this Section
7.13.

 

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of
financing is not a condition to Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if any
financing contemplated to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with the Merger has not been obtained prior to Closing, Parent and Merger Sub
shall continue to be obligated, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VIII, to consummate the Merger and the
Transactions at the Closing in accordance with this Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in
Section 8.2(a)(ii), as it applies to the Companys obligations under this
Section 7.13 (other than Section 7.13(a)(x)), shall be deemed satisfied unless
the Financing has not been obtained primarily as a result of the Companys or
its Subsidiaries willful and material breach of their obligations under this
Section 7.13 with respect to the Financing.

 

7.14 _Financing_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange
and obtain the Credit Agreement Financing on the terms and conditions
(including the "flex" provisions applicable to the Credit Agreement) of the
Credit Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy on a
timely basis (and in a manner that will not impede the ability of the parties
to consummate the Merger as promptly as reasonably possible) all conditions
and covenants applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Credit Agreement,
(ii) consummate the Credit Agreement Financing at or prior to Closing (subject
to termination, replacement or reduction as contemplated in this Section
7.14), (iii) enforce their rights under the Credit Agreement with respect
thereto and (iv) unless the commitments under the Credit Agreement are
terminated as provided below in this Section 7.14(a), maintain in effect the
Credit Agreement until the Transactions are consummated (or until this
Agreement otherwise terminates). Parent and Merger Sub shall not agree to any
amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or
other provision under the Credit Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) that (I) would impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise
expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Credit Agreement Financing to fund the Transactions in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to make the consummation of the Credit Agreement
Financing less likely, (II) would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
Parent or Merger Subs ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement

 



59  or (III) would delay the timing of the funding of commitments under the
Credit Agreement; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, (1) Parent may amend the Credit Agreement solely to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed the Credit Agreement as of the date hereof; _provided_
that, where consent of Parent is required, such amendment would not
reasonably be expected to materially delay the availability of the Financing
or in any material respect, the ability or likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub
to consummate the Transactions, in each case, determined as of the date
of such amendment, and (2) Parent and Merck Financial Services GmbH shall
have the right to reduce the commitments under the Credit Agreement by an
amount not to exceed the aggregate amount of (x) the aggregate amount of any
net cash proceeds received by Parent and/or its Subsidiaries after the date
hereof from Financings and/or dispositions consummated after the date hereof
so long as (A) an amount equal to any such reduction in commitments is
retained by Parent and/or its Subsidiaries in the form of Retained Current
Financial Assets, and (B) to the extent any of such proceeds are from
securities or Indebtedness that has a scheduled redemption or mandatory
redemption or put right (other than customary change of control redemption or
put rights), such scheduled redemption is not scheduled to occur prior to, and
such right is not exercisable prior to, a date that is earlier than the
Termination Date or (y) other Retained Current Financial Assets of Parent
and/or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that, in the case of clause (x) or (y),
such Retained Current Financial Assets may be replaced by increased
commitments under the Credit Agreement or any commitments under any New
Financing (which shall not expand in any respect upon the conditions
precedent or contingencies to the funding on the closing date of the Credit
Agreement Financing as set forth in the Credit Agreement in effect on the date
hereof in a manner that would reasonably be expected to make the consummation
of such New Financing less likely than consummation of the Credit Agreement
Financing or otherwise adversely affect the ability or likelihood of Parent or
Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); _provided_ , _further_ , that it is agreed that Parent may
terminate the commitments of a defaulting lender under the Credit Agreement to
the extent such commitment has been replaced, or will be replaced
substantially contemporaneously with such termination, by a commitment at
least equal to the terminated commitment. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Retained Current Financial Assets_ " are Current Financial Assets of
Parent and/or its Subsidiaries (x) that are identified by Parent for the
purpose of funding the Transactions (it being understood and agreed that any
such Current Financial Assets may at any time and from time to time be
substituted for with other Current Financial Assets that would satisfy at the
time of such substitution the requirements of this definition of "Retained
Current Financial Assets"), (y) as to which there are no conditions or
restrictions on Parents ability to use such Current Financial Assets to fund
the Transactions (including any restriction as to which a Subsidiary of Parent
is subject, to the extent such restriction prohibits such Subsidiary from
transferring, directly or indirectly, such Current Financial Asset to Parent)
and (z) to the extent any of such Retained Current Financial Assets were
generated from securities or Indebtedness that has a scheduled redemption or
mandatory redemption or put right (other than customary change of control
redemption or put rights), such scheduled redemption is not scheduled to occur
prior to, and such right is not exercisable prior to, a date that is earlier
than the Termination Date.

 

(b) If any portion of the Credit Agreement Financing expires or otherwise
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex"
provisions applicable thereto) contemplated in the Credit Agreement (other
than as contemplated by Section 7.14(a)),

 



60  Parent and Merger Sub shall, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain a new credit agreement or other debt financing or commitments (a "
_New Financing_ ") from alternative sources providing for debt financing in an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (taking into account the Retained Current Financial Assets meeting
the requirements described in Section 7.14(a)), on terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) that are at least as favorable to Parent and
the Company in the aggregate as those contained in the Credit Agreement,
which shall not expand in any respect upon the conditions precedent or
contingencies to the funding on the closing date of the Credit Agreement
Financing as set forth in the Credit Agreement in effect on the date hereof in
a manner that would reasonably be expected to make the consummation of such
New Financing less likely than consummation of the Credit Agreement Financing
or otherwise adversely affect the ability or likelihood of Parent or Merger
Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent and Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company true, correct and complete
copies (subject to redactions of pricing related information and other
economic terms) of any definitive documentation related to a New Financing.
In the event Parent and Merger Sub enter into any definitive documentation
relating to a New Financing, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the "
_Credit Agreement Financing_ " shall mean the debt financing contemplated by
the Credit Agreement as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below, and (ii) any
reference in this Agreement to the " _Credit Agreement_ " shall be deemed to
include the Credit Agreement to the extent not superseded by the definitive
documentation relating to a New Financing at the time in question and any
definitive documentation relating to a New Financing to the extent then in
effect.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis of any material developments or breaches under the Credit
Agreement which, in each case, are reasonably expected to render all or any
portion of the Credit Agreement Financing that would be required to consummate
the Transactions unavailable, including the receipt from the Facility Agent
(as defined in the Credit Agreement) of written notice alleging the
occurrence of any such breach, and shall promptly provide the Company with any
additional information reasonably requested by the Company from time to time
relating to Parents and Merger Subs efforts to obtain the Credit Agreement
Financing, Financing and New Financing, as applicable. Parent shall furnish
the Company complete, correct and executed copies of any amendments to the
Credit Agreement promptly upon their execution (it being understood and
agreed that any such amendment that solely would add a lender, lead arranger,
bookrunner, syndication agent or similar entity who had not executed the
Credit Agreement as of the date hereof in accordance with the terms
of Section 7.14(a) shall not be subject to this sentence).

7.15 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such
steps as may be reasonably required to cause dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

7.16 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors arising after the date hereof as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including providing
Parent the opportunity to review and comment on proposed additional
disclosure in the Proxy Statement), and unless such settlement is solely (a)
for

 



61  monetary damages entirely paid for with proceeds of insurance (other than
the deductible under insurance policy(ies) in effect as of the date hereof) or
(b) to provide additional disclosure in the Proxy Statement that does not
disparage Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any of
their respective Affiliates or any of their respective businesses, no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, it being
understood that, in determining whether to consent, Parent is required only to
consider its own interests relating to such settlement).

 

7.17 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations. 

7.18 _Adoption by Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub_. As promptly as practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall cause the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub to authorize and approve the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and approve and adopt the form,
terms and provisions of this Agreement.

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.2(a) shall not be
available to any party if the failure of the Merger to have been consummated

the Requisite Company Vote shall not have been obtained at such Company
Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof; or

cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the Termination Date or (y) if capable of
being cured, shall not have been cured (A) within 30 calendar days following
delivery of written notice by the Company to Parent of such breach or (B) any
shorter period of time that remains between the date the Company delivers
written notice of such breach and the Termination Date; _provided_ , that the
Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.3(b) if it is then in breach of any representation, warranties,
covenants or other agreements hereunder that would result in the closing
condition set forth in Section 8.2(a) not being satisfied.

 

9.4 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action of the

Company by the Termination Date or (y) if capable of being cured, shall not
have been cured (A) within 30 calendar days following delivery of written
notice by Parent to the Company of such breach or (B) any shorter period of
time that remains between the date Parent delivers written notice of such
breach and the Termination Date; _provided_ , that Parent shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.4(b) if it is
then in breach of any representation, warranties, covenants or other
agreements hereunder that would result in the closing condition set forth in
Section 8.3(a) not being satisfied.

 

9.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article IX, this Agreement
shall become void and of no effect with no Liability to any Person on the part
of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates or
Financing Sources); _provided_ , _however_ , and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, that in the event of termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms (i) no such termination shall
relieve the Company from any Liability to pay the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to this Section 9.5 if and when due

 



66  in accordance with the provisions hereof, (ii) no such termination shall
relieve Parent from any Liability to pay the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant
to this Section 9.5 if and when due in accordance with the provisions hereof,
(iii) neither the Company nor Parent shall be relieved or released from
Liability for willful and material breach of this Agreement or for fraud, (iv)
the provisions set forth in this Section 9.5 and the second sentence of
Section 10.1 shall operate in accordance with their terms and (v) no such
termination shall release the Financing Sources from any Liability to Parent
and its Subsidiaries, or the Parent and its Subsidiaries from any Liability
to the Financing Sources, in each case, under or arising out of the Credit
Agreement or any related or replacement agreement (excluding this Agreement)
or any other agreement entered into with Parent or its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any of the Financing Sources, on the other hand. For the
avoidance of doubt, any failure by Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the date the Closing should
have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2 because the Financing has not been
obtained when (x) all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VIII
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver
(to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of those conditions) shall be
satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to such date
and (y) the Company has not willfully and materially breached Section 7.13 of
this Agreement with respect to the Financing in a manner that materially
contributed to such failure to obtain the Financing, shall be deemed to be a
"willful and material" breach of this Agreement by Parent for purposes of
this Agreement.

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.2(a) (relating to
the Termination Date) before obtaining the Requisite Company Vote or this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.2(b) (relating to failure to
obtain the Requisite Company Vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting), (B)
any Person shall have made or renewed a _bona fide_  Acquisition Proposal
after the date hereof that is publicly disclosed or publicly announced by such
Person and shall not have been irrevocably publicly withdrawn (x) with respect
to a termination pursuant to Section 9.2(a), prior to such termination or (y)
with respect to a termination pursuant to Section 9.2(b), prior to a date that
is at least five (5) business days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting
(in either case, a " _Qualifying Proposal_ "), and (C) within nine (9) months
of such termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal is
consummated (in each case whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the
same as the original Qualifying Proposal referred to in clause (B));
_provided_ , that for purposes of this Section 9.5(b), the term "Acquisition
Proposal" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in Section 7.2(c),
except that all references to 20% therein shall be deemed to be references to
50%;

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.4(a)
(relating to a Company Change of Recommendation and similar events); or

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.3(a)
(relating to an Alternative Acquisition Agreement);

 



67 then the Company shall promptly (but in no event later than (A) in the case of
clause (i) above, on the earlier of the date on which the Company (x) enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and (y)
consummates the Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (i) above, (B) in
the case of clause (ii) above, three (3) business days after the date of such
termination or (C) in the case of clause (iii) above, immediately prior to or
concurrently with termination of this Agreement by the Company), pay Parent
(or, at Parents direction, an Affiliate of Parent) the Company Termination
Fee (as defined below), it being understood that in no event shall the Company
be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The
term " _Company Termination Fee_ " shall mean $552,135,000, except in the
event the Company Termination Fee becomes payable as the result of the
termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 9.3(a) to
accept a Superior Proposal with respect to which (1) the Person making such
Superior Proposal first made its Acquisition Proposal that resulted in such
Superior Proposal within thirty (30) days following the date hereof, (2) the
Company Board determined during such period that such Acquisition Proposal is
or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal (the first
date of such Company Board determination, the " _Company Board Determination
Date_ ") and (3) the Company terminates this Agreement to accept such
Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 9.3(a) no later than thirty (30) days
following the Company Board Determination Date, in which case " _Company
Termination Fee_ " shall mean $318,540,000. Any Company Termination Fee paid
to Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent to the Company for such purpose. The parties hereby acknowledge that
in the event that the Company Termination Fee (together with the reimbursement
contemplated by Section 9.5(d)) is paid by the Company pursuant to this
Section 9.5(b), the Company Termination Fee (together with the reimbursement
contemplated by Section 9.5(d)) shall be Parents and Subs sole and exclusive
remedy for monetary damages under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Agreement shall limit Parents rights with respect to
losses or damages incurred or suffered as a result of a willful and material
breach by the Company of this Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
(i) pursuant to Section 9.2(c) as a result of an Order in connection with any
Antitrust Law, or (ii) Section 9.2(a), and all of the conditions to Closing of
Parent set forth in Article VIII (other than (A) the conditions set forth in
Sections 8.1(b)(i), (ii) and (iii) and 8.1(c) with respect to or relating to
Antitrust Laws or approvals and (B) those other conditions that, by their
nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but, in the case of clause
(B), which conditions would be capable of satisfaction if the Closing Date
were the date of such termination, in each case other than any failures of
such conditions to be satisfied that result from a breach by Parent of this
Agreement where such breach materially contributed to the failure of
such conditions to be satisfied or capable of being satisfied) have been
satisfied or waived on or prior to the date of such termination, then Parent
shall promptly, but in no event later than three (3) business days after the
date of such termination, pay to the Company a fee of $934,383,000 (the "
_Reverse Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall
Parent or Merger Sub be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more
than one occasion. Any Reverse Termination Fee paid to the Company pursuant
to this Agreement shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Company to Parent
for such purpose.

 



68 (d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 9.5
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement
and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 9.5 do not constitute a
penalty; accordingly, if either party (the " _Paying Party_ ") fails to
promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 9.5 and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company, or Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable
(the " _Payment Recipient Party_ ") commences a legal action that results in
a judgment against the Paying Party for any amounts due pursuant to this
Section 9.5, the Paying Party shall pay to the Payment Recipient Party its
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such legal
action, together with interest on the amount of such amount or portion thereof
at the latest U.S. prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except in the case of a
willful and material breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations in
Section 7.5 with respect to or relating to Antitrust Laws or approvals or
specific performance prior to termination of this Agreement, the Reverse
Termination Fee (together with the reimbursement contemplated by Section
9.5(d)) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its
Affiliates against Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates and any of
their respective former, current, or future stockholders, directors,
officers, Affiliates or agents (and of the Company and its Affiliates against
the Financing Sources) for any losses or damages of whatsoever nature suffered
as a result of any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations
in Section 7.5 with respect to or relating to Antitrust Laws or approvals,
and upon payment of the Reverse Termination Fee (together with the
reimbursement contemplated by Section 9.5(d)) if and when due, (i) none of
Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
former, current, or future stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates or
agents or Financing Sources shall have any further Liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement ( _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not limit any
Liability or obligation of the Financing Sources to Parent or its Subsidiaries
or of Parent or its Subsidiaries to the Financing Sources, in each case,
under or arising out of the Credit Agreement or any related or replacement
agreement (excluding this Agreement) or any other agreement entered into with
any of the Financing Sources, on the one hand, and Parent or
its Subsidiaries, on the other hand) in connection with such breach by Parent
or Merger Sub, (ii) payment and receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee
(together with the reimbursement contemplated by Section 9.5(d)) shall
extinguish any right of the Company, on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries, to sue or pursue any claim for any such losses or damages
against any of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates, any of their
respective former, current, or future stockholders, directors, officers,
Affiliates or agents and the Financing Sources with respect to, in connection
with or arising out of such breach by Parent or Merger Sub, and (iii) the
Company shall terminate with prejudice any pending claims in
litigation pursuing any such claim for such losses or damages commenced prior
to receiving the Reverse Termination Fee with respect to, in connection with
or arising out of such breach by Parent or Merger Sub. For purposes of this
Section 9.5(e), a "willful" breach shall mean the failure by any individual
set forth on Section 9.5(e) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, acting on
behalf of Parent, to take action with specific knowledge and belief that such
action is required to be taken by Parent pursuant to Section 7.5 with respect
to or relating to Antitrust Laws or approvals. For the avoidance of doubt, it
is understood that a failure to take action shall not be "willful" if the
person claimed to have 

 



69  willfully failed to take any action had a good faith belief (after
consultation with relevant outside counsel) that such action (a) was not
lawful, (b) would reasonably be expected to, in conjunction with all other
actions contemplated to be taken to obtain antitrust approval, result in an
Antitrust MAE, or (c) otherwise was not necessary to obtain antitrust
regulatory approval on the timing and in the manner contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event of a willful and material breach by Parent of its
obligations under Section 7.5 with respect to or relating to Antitrust Laws or
approvals, any Reverse Termination Fee paid to the Company shall be deducted
from any damages awarded for such breach. For purposes of Section 7.5 and
this Section 9.5(e), "not lawful" shall mean that an action violates any
statute, rule or regulation of a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
in any respect (for the avoidance of doubt, (i) the violation or breach of
any Contract, in and of itself, shall not be deemed to make an action not
lawful and (ii) the fact that a sale or other disposition of assets or any
other action may require consents, approvals, licenses or authorizations from
Governmental Entities, in and of itself, shall not make such sale or other
disposition or other action (or agreeing to such sale or disposition or other
action) not lawful).

 

ARTICLE X

_MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL_

10.1 _Survival_. This Article X and the covenants and agreements of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement that expressly
contemplate performance after the Effective Time shall survive the
consummation of the Merger in accordance with their terms. This Article X and
the agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section
7.10 (Expenses), the indemnification and reimbursement provisions of Section
7.13 (Financing Cooperation) and Section 9.5 (Effect of Termination and
Abandonment) and the Confidentiality Agreements shall survive the
termination of this Agreement (in the case of the Confidentiality Agreements,
subject to the terms thereof). All other representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall not survive the consummation
of the Merger or the termination of this Agreement.

10.2 _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of the applicable
Law, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may modify
or amend this Agreement, by written agreement executed and delivered by duly
authorized officers of the respective parties, whether before or after Company
stockholder approval hereof; _provided_ , that after Company stockholder
approval hereof, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires the further
approval of such shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, without such
further approval. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Sections 9.5(a), 9.5(e), 10.2, 10.5(a), 10.5(b), 10.8 and 10.15 hereof (and
any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification,
waiver or termination of such provision would modify the substance of
Sections 9.5(a), 9.5(e), 10.2, 10.5(a), 10.5(b), 10.8 or 10.15 hereof) may
not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse in
any respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the
arrangers of the Credit Agreement Financing. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Financing Source_ " means the entities that have committed to
provide or otherwise entered into agreements with Parent and/or its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Credit Agreement Financing or other
financings in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the parties to any loan or credit agreements (or other

 



70  definitive documentation) relating thereto, together with their respective
Affiliates and their and their respective Affiliates former, current or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, agents,
representatives, employees, directors, or officers and their respective
successors and assigns.

 

10.3 _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the parties
obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party
and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

10.4 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (including by facsimile, by electronic mail in "portable document
format" (.pdf) form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the
original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document), each such

counterparts shall together constitute the same agreement. This Agreement
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered (by telecopy, facsimile, electronic mail, .pdf or
otherwise as authorized by the prior sentence) to the other parties.

 

10.5 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Remedies_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CHOICES OR
CONFLICTS OF LAW (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION)
THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN
THE STATE OF DELAWARE. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action
or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contained in or contemplated by this Agreement,
or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the
other party hereto or its successors or assigns, exclusively in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (and any state appellate court therefrom),
or to the extent such Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any
federal court located within the State of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ "),
and in connection with claims (including counterclaims and defenses) arising
under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this
Agreement (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen
Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or
proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen
Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party
hereto, (iv) waives any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for any reason other than the failure to
serve in accordance with this Section 10.5(a), (v) waives any claims that
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by the
Chosen Courts, and (vi) agrees that service of process upon such party in any
such action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance
with Section 10.6 of this Agreement. The agent for service of process for
Parent shall be Merger Sub and any claim form, judgment or notice of legal
process shall be sufficiently served on Parent if delivered to such agent at
its address set forth above. THE COMPANY AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT (AND WILL
CAUSE ITS AFFILIATES NOT TO) BRING OR SUPPORT ANY ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION,
CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIM OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION,

 



71  WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE,
AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCES IN ANY WAY RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY
FORUM OTHER THAN THE FEDERAL AND NEW YORK STATE COURTS LOCATED IN THE CITY OF
NEW YORK, BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN (AND APPELLATE COURTS THEREOF); _PROVIDED_ THAT
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY SUCH ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM OR
THIRD PARTY CLAIM BROUGHT SUBSEQUENT TO THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY AND ALL RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY
LITIGATION AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii)
EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.5(b).

(c) _Remedies_.

 

(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy.

 

(ii) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such
damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article
IX, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one
hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective
covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by 

 



72  the other, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this
Agreement to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable Law. Each
party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party, and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of such party under this Agreement. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. The parties hereto further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this Section 10.5(c), a party shall not in any respect waive
its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party
under this Agreement (including monetary damages) in the event that the
remedies provided for in this Section 10.5(c) are not available or otherwise
are not granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this Section 10.5(c) shall
require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section
10.5(c) prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
Article IX (and/or receipt of any amounts due pursuant to Section 9.5), nor
shall the commencement of any legal action or legal proceeding pursuant to
this Section 10.5(c) or anything set forth in this Section 10.5(c) restrict
or limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of Article IX including termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.3(a) in which case as provided in Section 9.5 the payments required
to be made by the Company under Section 9.5, shall be paid, or pursue any
other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.
For the avoidance of doubt, (i) Parent may pursue a grant of specific
performance of the type described in this Section 10.5(c) and the payment of
the Company Termination Fee under Section 9.5, but under no circumstances
shall Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance and the Company Termination Fee and (ii) the Company may pursue a
grant of specific performance of the type described in this Section 10.5(c)
and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee under Section 9.5, but under
no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance and the Reverse Termination Fee. If on the
Termination Date, there is a pending Action that has been brought by a party
hereto seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 10.5(c)(ii), then,
without further action, the Termination Date shall be automatically extended
until the date that is five (5) business days after the dismissal, settlement
or entry of a final order with respect to such Action.

10.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
shall not, confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto) any rights
or remedies hereunder, except (a) as specifically set forth in the terms and
provisions of Section 7.11, and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the
rights of Record Holders to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and

(other than in circumstances where the Reverse Termination Fee is payable) as

efforts to obtain specific performance of such obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub and all requests for such relief shall have been judicially denied

of the premium offered to such stockholders) for such willful and material
breach by Parent or Merger Sub (other than a willful and material breach by
Parent or Merger Sub of Section 7.5 of this Agreement with respect to
Antitrust Laws or approvals) shall be available under this clause (d) subject
to the provisos and other limitations herein; _provided_ , that the rights

its sole and absolute discretion, on behalf of the stockholders of the
Company, and any amounts received by the

 



75  Company in connection therewith may be retained by the Company; _provided_ ,

relevance, applicability, validity or existence of any such damages and it is
agreed that Parent and Merger Sub may contest such damages (as to
appropriateness, relevance, applicability, validity or existence and as to
amount asserted) in any such claim; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no
event shall Parent or its Subsidiaries be required to pay in respect of any
damages asserted by the Company of more than an aggregate of $700,000,000
less the sum of all amounts, if any, paid by Parent or its Subsidiaries to the
Company, its Subsidiaries or the Companys stockholders in connection with the
termination of this Agreement or any claim relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any breach thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, except as
provided in clauses (b) and (d) of the first sentence of this Section 10.8,
the Companys stockholders are not third party beneficiaries of this
Agreement, and no damages may be claimed by the Company on behalf of the
Companys stockholders or directly by the Company based in any respect on
claimed loss or damage incurred by the Companys stockholders, including loss
of economic benefit or any premium attributable to the Merger. Except as
provided above in this Section 10.8, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set
forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement
is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person (including
any Person claiming any rights arising from or through the parties hereto)
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties and covenants set forth
herein. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party
beneficiaries under clause (b) of this Section 10.8 and Section 7.11 shall not
arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date hereof or as of any other date.

10.9 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

10.10 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such similar Taxes and fees (including penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation when due.

 

10.11 _Definitions_. For convenience of reference only, each of the terms set
forth in Annex A is defined in the Section of this Agreement set forth
opposite such term.

 



76 10.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

10.13 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents, Annex A and headings herein are for convenience of
reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a
reference in this Agreement is made to a Section, such reference shall be to a
Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. 

(c) Each party here has or may have set forth information in its respective
Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of
this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

 

(d) The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular
as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to
the feminine and neuter genders of such terms.

(e) The parties intend that each representation, warranty and
covenant contained herein will have independent significance. If any party
has breached or violated (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 7.1),
or if there is an inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty or covenant
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 7.1) contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
covenant related to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels
of specificity), which the party has not breached or violated, or with
respect to which there is not an inaccuracy, will not detract from or mitigate
the fact that the party has breached or violated, or there is an inaccuracy
in, the first representation, warranty or covenant.

 



77 10.14 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any
of or all of its rights, interest and obligations under this Agreement to
Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and
Parent and Merger Sub may so assign to any parties providing debt financing to
the Surviving Corporation for purposes of creating a security interest herein
or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of such debt financing, but no
such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Parent shall cause Merger Sub, and any assignee
thereof, to perform its obligations under this Agreement and shall be
responsible for any failure of Merger Sub or such assignee to comply with any
representation, warranty, covenant or other provision required to be performed
on or prior to the Closing, under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in
violation of this Agreement is void.

10.15 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
Action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made
against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto
(including any third party beneficiaries hereto) and none of (a) Parents or
any of its Affiliates or any direct or indirect stockholders (other than
Parent or Merger Sub), members, managers, directors, officers, employees,
agents, representatives, Financing Sources or assignees of any of
the foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") or (b) the
Companys or any of its Affiliates stockholders (other than the Company),
members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or
assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Company Related
Parties_ "), in each case, shall have any Liability for any obligations or
Liabilities of the other parties to this Agreement or for any Action (whether
in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights
of the parties hereunder against the other parties to this Agreement, in no
event shall (i) the Company or any of its Affiliates, and the Company agrees
not to and to cause its Affiliates not to, seek to enforce this Agreement
against, commence any Actions for breach of this Agreement against, or seek
to recover monetary damages from, any Parent Related Party, or (ii) Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, and Parent and Merger Sub
agree not to and to cause their respective Affiliates not to, seek to enforce
this Agreement against, commence any Actions for breach of this Agreement
against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Company Related Party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Financing Sources (in their capacity as such) shall not have any liability to
the Company or any of its equity holders, representatives or Affiliates (in
each case, with respect to such equity holders, representatives or Affiliates,
prior to the Closing of the Merger) relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
whether at law or equity, in contract or in tort or otherwise, and the Company
and its equity holders, representatives and Affiliates (in each case, with
respect to such equity holders, representatives or Affiliates, prior to the
Closing of the Merger) shall not have any rights or claims, and shall not seek
any loss or damage or any other recovery or judgment of any kind, including
direct, indirect, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages,
against any Financing Source (in its capacity as such) under this Agreement or
the Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract or in tort or
otherwise.
