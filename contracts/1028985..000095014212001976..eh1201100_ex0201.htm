anything to the contrary herein, the foregoing provisions of this Section
2.01(c) shall not apply with respect to the HHI Companies Equity Interests,

Section 2.07(b)(ii), Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, not less
than three (3) Business Days before the First Closing Date, a written
statement certified by an officer of Seller setting forth Seller's good faith
estimate of: (i) the Modified Working Capital (such amount, the "Estimated
Modified Working Capital"), (ii) the HHI Closing Net Indebtedness (which shall

the categories described in clauses (a) through (d) of the definition of "Cash
and Cash Equivalents") (the "Estimated HHI Closing Net Indebtedness"), and
(iii) the Estimated Purchase Price. Seller agrees that it shall prepare such
statement in accordance with, as applicable, the definition of "HHI Closing
Net Indebtedness" and, in the case of the Estimated Modified Working Capital,
such statement shall be prepared in accordance with Exhibit K, and Seller
shall deliver together with such statement any supporting documentation and
additional information as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser with
respect to any estimated amounts used by Seller in calculating the amounts set
forth on such statement. Seller shall consult in good faith with Purchaser in
the preparation of such statement and shall provide Purchaser with a draft

shall consider in good faith the reasonable comments provided by Purchaser
prior to preparing the final calculation of the Estimated HHI Purchase Price.

  

  

(d) As used in this Agreement, the "Estimated TLM Purchase Price" shall mean
an amount equal to the Base TLM Purchase Price plus the amount, which may be
positive or negative, equal to the Estimated TLM Closing Net Indebtedness. For
purposes of determining the amount of cash to be paid as the Estimated TLM
Purchase Price by Purchaser at the Second Closing pursuant to Section
2.08(b)(ii), Seller shall prepare and deliver, not less than three (3)
Business Days before the Second Closing Date, a written statement certified by

(e) The Base HHI Purchase Price shall be allocated as provided in Exhibit J.
Within thirty (30) days after the HHI Purchase Price shall have been deemed to
be final pursuant to Section 2.04 below, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a
certificate which shall reasonably allocate the HHI Purchase Price and the
Assumed HHI Liabilities among the HHI Companies, the HHI Company Subsidiaries
and the Transferred HHI Assets based on the allocation of the Base HHI
Purchase Price in Exhibit J and in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
(the "HHI Allocation Certificate"). Seller shall have a period of five (5)
Business Days after the delivery of the HHI Allocation Certificate (the "HHI
Response Period") to present in writing to Purchaser notice of any objections
Seller may have to the allocation set forth therein (an "HHI Objections
Notice"). Unless Seller timely objects, such HHI Allocation Certificate shall
be binding on the parties without further adjustment, absent manifest error.
If Seller shall raise any objections within the HHI Response Period, Purchaser
and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts
to resolve such dispute. If the parties fail to agree within fifteen (15) days
after the delivery of the HHI Objections Notice, then the disputed items shall
be resolved by the Accounting Arbitrator, whose determination shall be final
and binding on the parties. The Accounting Arbitrator shall resolve the
dispute within thirty (30) days after the item has been referred to it. The
costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne equally
by Seller and Purchaser. Purchaser and Seller shall (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries, or, in the case of Purchaser, its Affiliates, to)
report the national, federal, state, provincial and local income and other Tax
consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner
consistent with the HHI Allocation Certificate. Except as otherwise required
by applicable Law, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall (and neither party shall
permit its respective Subsidiaries, or, in the case of Purchaser, its
Affiliates, to) take a position inconsistent with the HHI Allocation
Certificate on any Tax Return or filings (including any forms required to be
filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code). Each of Seller and Purchaser
shall cooperate with the other in preparing IRS Form 8594 or any equivalent
statements required by any Governmental Authority charged with the collection
of any income Tax for filing within a reasonable period before its filing due
date.

  

  

(f) The Base TLM Purchase Price shall be allocated as provided in Exhibit J.
Within thirty (30) days after the TLM Purchase Price shall have been deemed to
be final pursuant to Section 2.05 below, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a
certificate which shall reasonably allocate the TLM Purchase Price and the
Assumed TLM Liabilities among TLM Philippines and the Transferred TLM Assets
based on the allocation of the Base TLM Purchase Price in Exhibit J and in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code (the "TLM Allocation Certificate").
Seller shall have a period of five (5) Business Days after the delivery of the
TLM Allocation Certificate (the "TLM Response Period") to present in writing
to Purchaser notice of any objections Seller may have to the allocation set
forth therein (a "TLM Objections Notice"). Unless Seller timely objects, such
TLM Allocation Certificate shall be binding on the parties without further
adjustment, absent manifest error. If Seller shall raise any objections within
the TLM Response Period, Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith
and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such dispute. If the parties
fail to agree within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the TLM
Objections Notice, then the disputed items shall be resolved by the Accounting
Arbitrator, whose determination shall be final and binding on the parties. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after

Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser.
Purchaser and Seller shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, or,
in the case of Purchaser, its Affiliates, to) report the national, federal,
state, provincial and local income and other Tax consequences of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the
TLM Allocation Certificate. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law,
neither Purchaser nor Seller shall (and neither party shall permit its
respective Subsidiaries, or, in the case of Purchaser, its Affiliates, to)
take a position inconsistent with the TLM Allocation Certificate on any Tax
Return or filings (including any forms required to be filed pursuant to
Section 1060 of the Code). Each of Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate with

Section 2.04 HHI Purchase Price Adjustment.

  

  

(a) Seller has prepared the attached Exhibit K, which lists certain current
assets and current liability accounts and certain accounting principles,
methodologies and policies used in the determination of such accounts, as well
as an illustrative calculation of Modified Working Capital as of September 1,
2012 for informational purposes only (and not as a representation or
warranty). Such accounts of the HHI Business, cumulatively, as of immediately
before the effective time of the First Closing (as set forth in Section
2.06(a)), determined in accordance with this Section 2.04, Exhibit K, and the
principles, methodologies and policies set forth in Exhibit K and, to the
extent not set forth therein, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which shall be
applied on a basis consistent with the Audited Financial Statements, shall
constitute the "Modified Working Capital." For the avoidance of doubt, amounts
included in the determination of HHI Closing Net Indebtedness or TLM Closing
Net Indebtedness shall be excluded from the determination of the Modified
Working Capital.

  

  

(b) If the HHI Purchase Price as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2.04 is less than the Estimated HHI Purchase Price, Seller shall pay
to Purchaser the total amount of such deficit, and if the HHI Purchase Price
as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.04 exceeds the
Estimated HHI Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the total amount
of such excess, in either case by wire transfer of immediately available U.S.
dollar funds to an account designated by the party receiving payment, within
three (3) Business Days after the final determination of the HHI Purchase
Price, plus interest on such amount, accrued from the First Closing Date to
the date of such payment at the prime rate applicable from time to time as
announced by Citibank, N.A.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) As promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within sixty (60) days
after the First Closing), Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a
statement setting forth Seller's calculation of (i) Modified Working Capital,
(ii) HHI Closing Net Indebtedness (which shall set forth with specificity the
amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents for each of the categories described in
clauses (a) through (d) of the definition of "Cash and Cash Equivalents"), and
(iii) the HHI Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.04 (the "HHI Closing
Statement"). The parties agree to provide each other and their respective
Representatives access to their respective books, records and personnel to the
extent relating to the HHI Business throughout the periods during which the
HHI Closing Statement is being prepared or evaluated and any disputes that may
arise under this Section 2.04 are being resolved. If Purchaser disagrees with
the determination of the HHI Closing Statement, Purchaser shall notify Seller
in writing of such disagreement within sixty (60) days after delivery of the
HHI Closing Statement, which written notice shall set forth any such
disagreement in reasonable detail ("Disagreement Notice"). If Purchaser fails
to deliver a Disagreement Notice by the end of such 60-day period, Purchaser
shall be deemed to have accepted the HHI Closing Statement delivered by
Seller. Matters included in the calculations in the HHI Closing Statement to
which Purchaser does not object in the Disagreement Notice shall be deemed
accepted by Purchaser and shall not be subject to further dispute or review.
Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such
disagreement, and any resolution agreed to in writing by Purchaser and Seller
shall be final and binding upon the parties.

  

  

(d) If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement as
contemplated by Section 2.04(c) within thirty (30) days after delivery by
Purchaser of a Disagreement Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly select
a mutually acceptable third party accounting firm, the retention of which will
not give rise to present or potential future auditor independence problems for
Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries, as
determined by the reasonable discretion of Seller and Purchaser, to resolve
such disagreement (the firm so selected shall be referred to herein as the
"Accounting Arbitrator"). The parties shall instruct the Accounting Arbitrator
to consider only those items and amounts set forth in the HHI Closing
Statement as to which Purchaser has disagreed pursuant to a Disagreement
Notice and Purchaser and Seller have not resolved their disagreement. The
scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
limited to whether such calculation was done in accordance with the terms
hereof, the accounting methods, standards, policies, practices,
classifications, estimation methodologies, assumptions or procedures used to
prepare the HHI Closing Statement, and whether there were mathematical errors
in the calculation of the HHI Closing Statement, and the Accounting Arbitrator
shall not make any other determination. The Accounting Arbitrator shall make
its determination based solely on written submissions, presentations and
supporting material provided by Purchaser and Seller and not pursuant to any
independent review. In resolving any such disagreement, the Accounting
Arbitrator may not assign a value to such item greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by Seller in the HHI Closing Statement or by Purchaser
in the Disagreement Notice or less than the lowest value for such item claimed
by Seller in the HHI Closing Statement or by Purchaser in the Disagreement
Notice. Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Accounting Arbitrator to deliver to all parties, as promptly as
practicable, a written report setting forth the resolution of any such
disagreement determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Such
report shall be final and binding upon the parties, absent manifest error. The
fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator arising in connection
with this Section 2.04 shall be borne by the parties in such proportion to
reflect the relative amount of each party's determination that has been
modified pursuant to the Accounting Arbitrator's report. For example, if
Purchaser claims in the Disagreement Notice that it is entitled to an
adjustment payment of $100,000, but the Accounting Arbitrator determines that
Purchaser has a valid claim for only $30,000, then Seller shall bear 30% of
the fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator and Purchaser shall
bear the other 70% of such fees, costs and expenses.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Purchaser and Seller agree that any payments made pursuant to this Section
2.04 shall be allocated in a manner consistent with any allocation agreed to
pursuant to Section 2.03(e).

  

  

(f) With respect to Cash and Cash Equivalents and Indebtedness of the HHI
Business denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, the current
foreign exchange rate for each such currency as of immediately before the
effective time of the First Closing as published by Reuters, shall be used to
convert such amounts into U.S. dollars for purposes of determining HHI Closing
Net Indebtedness in connection with the adjustments pursuant to this Section
2.04.

  

  

Section 2.05 TLM Purchase Price Adjustment.

  

  

(a) If the TLM Purchase Price as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2.05 is less than the Estimated TLM Purchase Price, Seller shall pay
to Purchaser the total amount of such deficit, and if the TLM Purchase Price
as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.05 exceeds the
Estimated TLM Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the total amount
of such excess, in either case by wire transfer of immediately available U.S.
dollar funds to an account designated by the party receiving payment, within
three (3) Business Days after the final determination of the TLM Purchase
Price, plus interest on such amount, accrued from the Second Closing Date to
the date of such payment at the prime rate applicable from time to time as
announced by Citibank, N.A.

  

  

(b) As promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within 60 days after the
Second Closing), Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement
setting forth Seller's calculation of (i) TLM Closing Net Indebtedness (which
shall set forth with specificity the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents for
the category described in clause (e) of the definition of "Cash and Cash
Equivalents"), and (ii) the TLM Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.05
(the "TLM Closing Statement"). The parties agree to provide each other and
their respective Representatives access to their respective books, records and
personnel to the extent relating to the TLM Business throughout the periods
during which the TLM Closing Statement is being prepared or evaluated and any
disputes that may arise under this Section 2.05 are being resolved. If
Purchaser disagrees with the determination of the TLM Closing Statement,
Purchaser shall notify Seller of such disagreement within 60 days after
delivery of the TLM Closing Statement by delivering a Disagreement Notice. If
Purchaser fails to deliver a Disagreement Notice by the end of such 60-day
period, Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the TLM Closing Statement
delivered by Seller. Matters included in the calculations in the TLM Closing
Statement to which Purchaser does not object in the Disagreement Notice shall
be deemed accepted by Purchaser and shall not be subject to further dispute or
review. Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such
disagreement, and any resolution agreed to in writing by Purchaser and Seller
shall be final and binding upon the parties.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement as
contemplated by Section 2.05(b) within thirty (30) days after delivery by
Purchaser of a Disagreement Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly refer
the matter to the Accounting Arbitrator. The parties shall instruct the
Accounting Arbitrator to consider only those items and amounts set forth in
the TLM Closing Statement as to which Purchaser has disagreed pursuant to a
Disagreement Notice and Purchaser and Seller have not resolved their
disagreement. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be limited to whether such calculation was done in accordance
with the terms hereof, the accounting methods, standards, policies, practices,
classifications, estimation methodologies, assumptions or procedures used to
prepare the TLM Closing Statement, and whether there were mathematical errors
in the calculation of the TLM Closing Statement, and the Accounting Arbitrator
shall not make any other determination. The Accounting Arbitrator shall make
its determination based solely on written submissions, presentations and
supporting material provided by Purchaser and Seller and not pursuant to any
independent review. In resolving any such disagreement, the Accounting
Arbitrator may not assign a value to such item greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by Seller in the TLM Closing Statement or by Purchaser
in the Disagreement Notice or less than the lowest value for such item claimed
by Seller in the TLM Closing Statement or by Purchaser in the Disagreement
Notice. Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Accounting Arbitrator to deliver to all parties, as promptly as
practicable, a written report setting forth the resolution of any such
disagreement determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Such
report shall be final and binding upon the parties, absent manifest error. The
fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator arising in connection
with this Section 2.05 shall be borne by the parties in such proportion to
reflect the relative amount of each party's determination that has been
modified pursuant to the Accounting Arbitrator's report. For example, if
Purchaser claims in the Disagreement Notice that it is entitled to an
adjustment payment of $100,000, but the Accounting Arbitrator determines that
Purchaser has a valid claim for only $30,000, then Seller shall bear 30% of
the fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator and Purchaser shall
bear the other 70% of such fees, costs and expenses.

  

  

(d) Purchaser and Seller agree that any payments made pursuant to this Section
2.05 shall be allocated in a manner consistent with any allocation agreed to
pursuant to Section 2.03(f).

  

  

(e) With respect to Cash and Cash Equivalents and Indebtedness of the TLM
Business denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, the current
foreign exchange rate for each such currency as of immediately before the
effective time of the Second Closing as published by Reuters, shall be used to
convert such amounts into U.S. dollars for purposes of determining TLM Closing
Net Indebtedness in connection with the adjustments pursuant to this Section
2.05.

coverage contemplated by the preceding sentence at least annually and as
otherwise reasonably requested by Seller. The transfer of such assets pursuant

(g) Permits and Licenses. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be required

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 2.11 Withholding. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as Purchaser is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the proper Governmental Authority by Purchaser, such withheld and deducted
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to Seller and the Subsidiary Transferors (as applicable) in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Purchaser.

  

  

Section 2.12 Net Xiaolan Cash.

  

  

(a) As promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within 60 days after the
First Closing), Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement
setting forth Seller's calculation of Closing Xiaolan Cash (the "Xiaolan Cash
Statement"). The parties agree to provide each other and their respective
Representatives access to their respective books, records and personnel to the
extent relating to the HHI Business throughout the periods during which the
Xiaolan Cash Statement is being prepared or evaluated and any disputes that
may arise under this Section 2.12 are being resolved. If Purchaser disagrees
with the determination of the Xiaolan Cash Statement, Purchaser shall notify
Seller of such disagreement within 60 days after delivery of the Xiaolan Cash
Statement by delivering a Disagreement Notice. If Purchaser fails to deliver a
Disagreement Notice by the end of such 60-day period, Purchaser shall be
deemed to have accepted the Xiaolan Cash Statement delivered by Seller.
Matters included in the calculations in the Xiaolan Cash Statement to which
Purchaser does not object in the Disagreement Notice shall be deemed accepted
by Purchaser and shall not be subject to further dispute or review. Purchaser
and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreement, and
any resolution agreed to in writing by Purchaser and Seller shall be final and
binding upon the parties.

  

  

(b) If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement as
contemplated by Section 2.12(a) within thirty (30) days after delivery by
Purchaser of a Disagreement Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly refer
the matter to the Accounting Arbitrator. The parties shall instruct the
Accounting Arbitrator to consider only those items and amounts set forth in
the Xiaolan Cash Statement as to which Purchaser has disagreed pursuant to a
Disagreement Notice and Purchaser and Seller have not resolved their
disagreement. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be limited to whether such calculation was done in accordance
with the terms hereof, the accounting methods, standards, policies, practices,
classifications, estimation methodologies, assumptions or procedures used to
prepare the Xiaolan Cash Statement, and whether there were mathematical errors
in the calculation of the Xiaolan Cash Statement, and the Accounting
Arbitrator shall not make any other determination. The Accounting Arbitrator
shall make its determination based solely on written submissions,
presentations and supporting material provided by Purchaser and Seller and not
pursuant to any independent review. In resolving any such disagreement, the
Accounting Arbitrator may not assign a value to such item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by Seller in the Xiaolan Cash Statement
or by Purchaser in the Disagreement Notice or less than the lowest value for
such item claimed by Seller in the Xiaolan Cash Statement or by Purchaser in
the Disagreement Notice. Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Arbitrator to deliver to all
parties, as promptly as practicable, a written report setting forth the
resolution of any such disagreement determined in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. Such report shall be final and binding upon the parties,
absent manifest error. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting
Arbitrator arising in connection with this Section 2.12 shall be borne by the
parties in such proportion to reflect the relative amount of each party's
determination that has been modified pursuant to the Accounting Arbitrator's
report. For example, if Purchaser claims in the Disagreement Notice that it is
entitled to an adjustment of $100,000, but the Accounting Arbitrator
determines that Purchaser has a valid claim for only $30,000, then Seller
shall bear 30% of the fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator
and Purchaser shall bear the other 70% of such fees, costs and expenses.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Within three (3) Business Days following the dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of the Chinese Joint Venture, Purchaser shall pay, without set-off,
to Seller the Net Xiaolan Cash, by wire transfer, in the local currency of the
Closing Xiaolan Cash, of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Seller. Within three (3) Business Days following the sale by Purchaser of
any or all of the Transferred Equity Interests held by Purchaser or its
designated Affiliate in the Chinese Joint Venture to a third party who is not
an Affiliate of Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay a portion of the proceeds
received from such sale, in an aggregate amount from such sale or series of
sales not to exceed the Net Xiaolan Cash ("Sale Proceeds"), without set-off,
to Seller, by wire transfer, in the local currency of the Closing Xiaolan
Cash, of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller.

  

  

(d) Following the First Closing and to the extent that (i) the Chinese Joint
Venture has terminated, or (ii) relocation of the Equipment and other non-real
property assets and the operations of the HHI Business located at the Xiaolan
Site is requested by any Governmental Authority, or is required pursuant to
any Governmental Order prior to December 31, 2015, Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries (including the Chinese Joint Venture) to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to apply the Closing Xiaolan Cash toward any
amounts that Seller would otherwise bear pursuant to Section 12.01(a)(viii)
and (ix); provided, that such amounts were due and payable prior to Purchaser
paying the Net Xiaolan Cash or Sale Proceeds to Seller pursuant to Section
2.12(c).

  

  

Section 2.13 Foreign Acquisition Agreements. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the parties shall, or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, enter into such agreements or instruments (the "Foreign
Acquisition Agreements") providing for the sale, transfer, conveyance,
assignment or delivery of any Transferred HHI Assets or Transferred TLM
Assets, and/or the assumption of any Assumed HHI Liabilities or Assumed TLM
Liabilities, located outside the United States of America as the parties
jointly determine would be required or advisable pursuant to requirements of
applicable local Law to be documented separately from this Agreement, which
Foreign Acquisition Agreements shall be negotiated in good faith between the
parties, but in all events shall be consistent with the terms of this
Agreement and have appropriate provisions to pay the applicable portion of the
HHI Purchase Price or TLM Purchase Price, as applicable, in local currency if
necessary (which will reduce the corresponding obligation to make payment
under this Agreement) in such amounts and such countries as jointly determined
by the parties. Any amounts payable in local currency shall be determined by
reference to the applicable spot rate published by Reuters on the date that is
three (3) Business Days prior to the applicable Closing.

(without needing to examine any underlying documentation or fact) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule that such disclosure is applicable. The inclusion
of any information in any section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or other

establish a standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

benefits received in the ordinary course under an Assumed Benefit Plan,

(e) If Purchaser complies with its obligations to make offers of employment to
the Employees who are required to receive offers of employment pursuant to
Section 7.01(a) (for purposes of this Section 4.09(e), the "Offered
Employees") in accordance with Section 7.01, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall (i) cause any material
payment (including severance, change in control or otherwise) to become due to
any Offered Employee under any HHI Benefit Plan, TLM Benefit Plan, Listed
Employee Benefit Plan or Deferred Transfer Employee Benefit Plan, (ii)
materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any HHI Benefit Plan,
TLM Benefit Plan, Listed Employee Benefit Plan, or Deferred Transfer Employee
Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in the acceleration of time of payment or
vesting of any such benefits under any HHI Benefit Plan, TLM Benefit Plan,
Listed Employee Benefit Plan or Deferred Transfer Employee Benefit Plan,
except, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), and (iii), for any
payments or benefits for which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
any Transferred Entities) shall be solely liable, provided that nothing herein
shall be intended to address the consequences of any actions taken by
Purchaser or its Affiliates in respect of Transferred Employees under any
Assumed Benefit Plan following the Closing Date.

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

by the terms of such plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued in
accordance with normal accounting practices, and (ii) each such plan required
to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing
with applicable Governmental Authorities.

  

  

(i) Except as set forth in Article VII, neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall cause Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates to incur or become subject to, either directly or indirectly or
secondarily, or on a contingent basis, any Liabilities under any HHI Benefit
Plan, TLM Benefit Plan, Listed Employee Benefit Plan or Deferred Transfer
Employee Benefit Plan (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any withdrawal
liability under ERISA with respect to any "multiemployer plans" (within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA)), other than the Assumed Benefit
Plans.

  

  

(j) Section 4.09(j) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a good faith
estimate of the aggregate amount of required severance and other termination
payments and benefits owing to the Employees employed by the Chinese Joint
Venture, whether under any Benefit Plan or applicable Law, assuming a

Section 4.10 Employee Matters. For the avoidance of doubt, the representations
contained in this Section 4.10 shall not apply to any Listed Employees until
sixty (60) days after the date hereof, at which time Seller will update the
Seller Disclosure Schedule with respect to the employee matters of the Listed
Employees pursuant to Section 7.06, and shall not apply to any Deferred
Transfer Employees until Seller has updated the Seller Disclosure Schedule
with respect to the employee matters of the Deferred Transfer Employees
pursuant to Section 7.07.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth on Section 4.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
(i) no Employee is represented by a labor union, labor organization or works
council (or representatives thereof) (collectively, a "Labor Organization"),
no Labor Organization has been certified or recognized as a representative of
any Employee, and neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or

or any other labor-related agreements or arrangements with any Labor
Organization pertaining to or which determines the terms or conditions of
employment of any Employee or Former Employee (collectively, "Labor

lock-outs of any kind, or threats thereof, by or with respect to any Employee
or any representatives thereof with respect to the Business; (iv) neither
Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in, admitted committing or been

claims, demands, grievances or arbitrations pending or, to Seller's Knowledge,
threatened with respect to the Business, between Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of the Employees or any representative

grievances or arbitrations, that individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has made
available to Purchaser complete and correct copies of each Labor Agreement
listed in Section 4.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. No Labor
Agreement or applicable Law requires Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to
consult with any Labor Organization or take any action with respect to any
Labor Agreement in connection with the execution of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  

  

(b) With respect to Employees, except as has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect, (i) Seller and each of its Subsidiaries has complied in all material
respects with each, and is not in violation in any material respect of any,
Law applicable to the employment of the Employees, including Laws relating to
anti-discrimination, equal employment opportunities and health and safety
regulations and (ii) there are no material violations of any other Law
respecting the hiring, hours, wages, occupational safety and health,
employment, promotion, termination or benefits of any Employee. Each Employee
who is required to maintain a work permit, visa, employment pass, or other
regulatory approval for his employment with Seller or its Affiliates in the
jurisdiction in which he is employed has provided to Seller a copy of such
work permit, visa, employment pass or to Seller's Knowledge, received such
other regulatory approval. Section 4.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a correct and complete list of each such Employee, the jurisdiction
in which he or she is employed, and the necessary requirements for his or her
employment in such jurisdiction.

  

  

(c) Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has, during the 90-day period
preceding the date hereof, effectuated a "plant closing" or a "mass lay-off"
(as such terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988 (the "WARN Act")), in either case affecting any site
of employment or facility of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the
Business, except in accordance with the WARN Act. Section 4.10(c) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the applicable Closing Date, a
list of each U.S. Former Employee who has been terminated involuntarily within
the ninety (90) day period prior to the applicable Closing Date, together with
such U.S. Former Employee's work location. With respect to any non-U.S. Former
Employees, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to determine whether any
notification may be required under Laws similar to the WARN Act as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with any such
statute with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" or similar event
affecting the Transferred Employees.

  

  

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Section 4.10(d) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of the name, date

independently conduct and operate the Business in the manner and to the extent
currently conducted by Seller and its Subsidiaries.

the Business, no Lien has been filed against either the personal or real
property of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries under any Environmental Law.

the Seller Policies and those Contracts entered into in connection with, as
contemplated by or otherwise related to the Overhead and Shared Services, HHI

(c) Except for terminations in accordance with the terms of such Material
Contracts after the date hereof, each Material Contract is a legal, valid and

other party thereto, and is in full force and effect subject in all cases to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles
of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at
Law, except for such failures to be a legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable, or in full force and effect that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Seller has made available to Purchaser a complete and
correct copy of each written Material Contract and a summary of the material
terms and conditions of each oral Material Contract, in each case, as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified through (and including) the date of this
Agreement, except, in the case of any employment agreement, that a redacted

any Material Contract and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no other party to any
such Material Contract is in breach or default thereunder, and to Seller's
Knowledge no event or condition has occurred and is continuing that
constitutes or would constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), a breach or default on the part of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any other party to such Material Contract, nor has Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries received any notice of any such breach, default, event or
condition, except, in each case, for any such breach, default, event or
condition that individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

fees, costs and expenses will be paid by Seller.

  

  

Section 4.14 Intellectual Property.

  

  

(a) Except for any Intellectual Property used for Overhead and Shared
Services, the Intellectual Property transferred to Purchaser under this
Agreement (including any Intellectual Property that constitutes a Transferred
Asset) and the Intellectual Property owned by the Transferred Entities as of
the applicable Closing Date, together with the Intellectual Property licensed
to Purchaser and the Transferred Entities under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements (collectively, the "Acquired Intellectual Property"),
include all Intellectual Property necessary to the operation of the Business
in the manner and to the extent currently conducted or, to Seller's Knowledge,
currently contemplated to be conducted by Seller and its Subsidiaries upon
giving effect to the applicable Closing (subject to (i) Section 6.07 and
Section 6.08, and (ii) the terms governing any Intellectual Property otherwise
licensed from Seller to Purchaser under the Transaction Documents (including
the Trademark License Agreement)). Other than the Seller Licensed IP,
Intellectual Property listed on Section 1.01(c) of the Seller Disclosure

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Schedule, the Excluded Assets and the Excluded Transferred Entity Assets, all
Intellectual Property used, held for use or necessary for use in the Business
in the manner and to the extent currently conducted or, to Seller's Knowledge,
currently contemplated to be conducted by Seller and its Subsidiaries is
either (i) (A) owned by a Transferred Entity or (B) a Transferred Asset owned
by Seller or its Subsidiaries ("Owned Intellectual Property"), or (ii) is used
by a Transferred Entity pursuant to a valid Contract ("Licensed Intellectual
Property"). All Intellectual Property licensed to Purchaser or the Transferred
Entities pursuant to (i) Section 6.08(a); (ii) the license agreement
contemplated by Section 6.08(b) or (iii) the Trademark License Agreement
(collectively, together with any other Intellectual Property licensed from
Seller to Purchaser under the Transaction Documents, the "Seller Licensed IP")
is either owned by Seller or its Subsidiaries or is used by either Seller or
its Subsidiaries pursuant to a valid Contract. Section 4.14(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of all Owned
Intellectual Property that is registered, issued or the subject of a pending
application. Subject to (i) Section 6.07 and Section 6.08, and (ii) the terms
governing any Intellectual Property otherwise licensed from Seller to
Purchaser under the Transaction Documents (including the Trademark License
Agreement), upon the applicable Closing, Purchaser, its designated Affiliates
and the Transferred Entities (as applicable) will continue to have the right
to use all Acquired Intellectual Property on identical terms and conditions as
Seller and its Subsidiaries enjoyed immediately prior to the applicable
Closing (except for any restriction binding upon Purchaser or its pre-Closing
Affiliates, including their granting of any Lien in any Acquired Intellectual
Property).

  

  

(b) Seller and its Subsidiaries together hold all rights, title and interest
to the Acquired Intellectual Property free and clear of any and all Liens,
except for Permitted Liens.

  

  

(c) The operation of the Business in the manner and to the extent currently
conducted or, to Seller's Knowledge, contemplated to be conducted by Seller
and its Subsidiaries does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate
the Intellectual Property of any Person; there are no claims pending or, to
Seller's Knowledge, threatened, that (i) other than as set forth on Section
4.14(c)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, allege the operation of the
Business infringes, misappropriates or is otherwise in violation of any
Intellectual Property of any Person or (ii) other than as set forth on Section
4.14(c)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, challenge the validity,
enforceability or ownership of any Acquired Intellectual Property. To Seller's
Knowledge, no rights in any Acquired Intellectual Property are being
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated by any Person; and, to
Seller's Knowledge, there is no existing fact or circumstance which would be
reasonably expected to give rise to any such claim.

  

  

(d) Seller and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable actions to
maintain and protect the Acquired Intellectual Property owned by Seller and
its Subsidiaries, including making filings and payments of maintenance,
renewal or similar fees for registered, issued or pending Acquired
Intellectual Property, and have taken commercially reasonable security
measures to protect the confidentiality of all trade secrets within the
Acquired Intellectual Property.

  

  

(e) Seller and its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all applicable
Laws regarding the collection, use, transmission, storage and protection of
Personal

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Data collected or used in connection with the Business and any applicable
privacy policies of Seller and its Subsidiaries ("Privacy Policies"), and, to
Seller's Knowledge, no Person has gained unauthorized access to or made any
unauthorized use of any such Personal Data. Each of Seller and its
Subsidiaries has adequate security measures in place to protect Personal Data
collected or used in connection with the Business that is stored in their
computer systems from unlawful use by any third party or any other use by a
third party that would violate the applicable Privacy Policy. The execution,
delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby do not violate any Privacy Policy as it
currently exists or as it existed at any time during which any Personal Data
was collected or obtained in connection with the Business (to the extent such
Privacy Policy still governs the use of such Personal Data). Upon the Closing,
Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Transferred Entities will own all such
Personal Data and continue to have the right to use such Personal Data on
identical terms and conditions as Seller and its Subsidiaries enjoyed
immediately prior to the applicable Closing, subject to Purchaser's compliance
with applicable Law and except for any restrictions binding upon Purchaser or
its pre-Closing Affiliates (including their granting of any Lien relating
thereto). No Actions are pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened
against Seller or its Subsidiaries relating to the collection or use of
Personal Data.

  

  

(f) Section 4.14(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all Intellectual Property which is registered,
issued or the subject of a pending application (the "SmartKey IP") used in
connection with the SmartKey technology, the SmartKey product line and the
SmartKey brand in the manner and to the extent currently conducted or, to
Seller's Knowledge, currently contemplated to be conducted by Seller and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the SmartKey Products"). Upon and at the
applicable Closing, Purchaser will own all right, title and interest in and to
all SmartKey IP, which rights and Intellectual Property are sufficient to use,
manufacture, market, promote, sell, distribute or exploit the SmartKey
Products (except with respect to Overhead and Shared Services). The SmartKey
Products do not incorporate any third party Intellectual Property.

  

  

(g) Each of Seller and its Subsidiaries is using commercially reasonable
efforts in prosecuting all patent applications it has filed which are included
in the Acquired Intellectual Property consistent with Seller's and its
Subsidiaries' past practices. Each of Seller and its Subsidiaries is using
commercially reasonable efforts in preparing to file patent applications for
all inventions in a manner and within a sufficient time period to avoid
statutory disqualification of any potential patent application included in the
Acquired Intellectual Property consistent with Seller's and its Subsidiaries'
past practices but, in any event, only in instances where Seller or one of its
Subsidiaries has determined that it wishes to attempt to seek patent
protection. To Seller's Knowledge, all prior art material to the patentability
of the claims in any issued or applied for patents included in the Acquired
Intellectual Property is, to the extent required under applicable Law,
disclosed or otherwise cited during prosecution in the respective issued
patents, applications or associated file histories thereof included in the
Acquired Intellectual Property, and, to Seller's Knowledge, there is no other
material prior art with respect thereto that was not disclosed in accordance
with applicable Law.

  

  

(h) All material software required for the operation of the Business and owned
by a Transferred Entity, included in the Transferred Assets or included in the
Overhead and Shared Services that are to be provided pursuant to the HHI
Transition Services

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Agreement and the TLM Transition Services Agreement (i) performs in material
conformance with its documentation; (ii) is free from any material software
defect; and (iii) does not contain any virus, software routine or hardware
component designed to permit unauthorized access or to disable or otherwise
harm any computer, systems or software, or any software routine designed to
disable a computer program automatically with the passage of time or under the
positive control of a person other than an authorized licensee or owner of
such software.

  

  

(i) Upon the applicable Closing, Purchaser, its designated Affiliates and the
Transferred Entities (as applicable) will continue to have the right to use
all Third Party Trademarks on identical terms and conditions as the HHI
Business or the TLM Business, as applicable, enjoyed immediately prior to the
applicable Closing (except for any restriction binding upon Purchaser or its
pre-Closing Affiliates, including their granting of any Lien on any Third
Party Trademark), where "Third Party Trademarks" as used above in this
sentence means any Trademark owned by an unaffiliated third party and used on
any Product manufactured, marketed, promoted, sold or distributed by the
Business as of the applicable Closing pursuant to a Contract with such third
party in effect as of the applicable Closing where such Contract is not
otherwise included within the Transferred Assets.

  

  

Section 4.15 Taxes.

  

  

(a) (i) (A) All Tax Returns required to be filed by the HHI Companies and the
HHI Company Subsidiaries prior to the First Closing Date have been (or will
have been by the First Closing Date) filed in a timely manner (taking into
account all extensions of due dates), (B) All Tax Returns required to be filed
by TLM Philippines prior to the Second Closing Date have been (or will have
been by the Second Closing Date) filed in a timely manner (taking into account
all extensions of due dates), (ii) such Tax Returns are correct, accurate and
complete in all respects, (iii) all Taxes due and owing by any Transferred
Entity or in respect of the Transferred Assets (whether or not shown on such

commitment letter, together with all exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements
and amendments thereto and the redacted fee letter, collectively, the "Debt
Financing Commitment"), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, the Financing Sources have agreed to lend the
amounts set forth therein (the "Debt Financing") for the purpose of funding
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date hereof, (x)
the Debt Financing Commitment has not been amended, restated or otherwise
modified or waived since copies thereof were delivered to Seller, (y) except
as permitted by Section 6.15, no such amendment, restatement, modification or
waiver is contemplated and (z) the commitment contained in the Debt Financing
Commitment has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. As

Commitment (other than customary engagement letters or as expressly set forth
in the Debt Financing Commitment furnished to Seller pursuant to this Section
5.07(a)). As of the date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment is in full

provisions), other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment. Assuming (A) the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the
Debt Financing Commitment, (B) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in Articles III and IV, and (C) performance by Seller and
its Subsidiaries of their obligations that are required to be performed prior
to the First Closing, the aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the
agreements contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment, together with
Purchaser's cash on hand, in the aggregate will be sufficient for Purchaser to
pay the Estimated Purchase Price on the First Closing Date, any payment
required to be made by Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.04 or Section 2.05 (if
any) and all related fees and expenses and any other payment contemplated in
this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitment. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Articles III and IV and
performance by Seller and its Subsidiaries of their obligations under this
Agreement, as of the date hereof, (I)

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

79  

  

 

 

 

  

  

no event has occurred that would result in any breach or violation of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) by Purchaser under the Debt Financing Commitment and
(II) Purchaser does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions
to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing will
not be available to Purchaser on the First Closing Date. Purchaser has fully
paid or has caused to be fully paid all commitment fees or other fees required
to be paid on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the Debt Financing
Commitment.

  

  

(b) Except as otherwise contemplated by Section 6.15(c), the obligations of
Purchaser under this Agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding the
ability of Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or any other Person to obtain
financing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 5.08 Solvency. Purchaser is not entering into this Agreement or the
Debt Financing Commitment with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors. Immediately after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Debt Financing Commitment,
including the Debt Financing, the payment of the Estimated Purchase Price, the
amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.04 or Section 2.05 (if any) and all
related fees and expenses, assuming (x) satisfaction of the conditions to
Purchaser's obligation to consummate the Acquisition as set forth herein and
the performance by Seller of its obligations hereunder in all material
respects, (y) the representations and warranties set forth in Articles III and
IV are true and correct in all material respects, and (z) no material adverse
change with respect to the business, operations, assets, properties and
financial condition of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries has occurred prior to
the applicable Closing, to the knowledge of Purchaser, immediately after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser,
its designated Affiliates and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(a) as of the applicable Closing Date will be able to pay its debts as they
become due and shall own property having a fair saleable value greater than
the amounts required to pay its debts (including a reasonable estimate of the
amount of all contingent liabilities) as they become absolute and mature and
(b) shall not have, as of such dates, unreasonably small capital to carry on
their businesses in which they are engaged. For purposes of this Section 5.08,
(i) "not have, as of such dates, unreasonably small capital to carry on their
businesses in which they are engaged" means that Purchaser, its Affiliates
designated pursuant to Section 2.01 or 2.02 and their respective Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, will be able to pay its debts and liabilities, direct,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become
absolute and matured and (ii) "fair saleable value" means the amount that may
be realized by an independent willing seller from an independent willing buyer
if the aggregate assets (both tangible and intangible) taken as a whole are
sold on a going concern basis with reasonable promptness in an arm's length
transaction under present conditions for the sale of comparable business
enterprises insofar as such conditions can be reasonably evaluated.

  

  

Section 5.09 Knowledge re Second Closing Approvals. Neither Purchaser nor its
Subsidiaries have any operations, conduct any business or own any assets in
the Republic of China (Taiwan) or in the Philippines that would have an
adverse impact on the parties' ability to satisfy the conditions set forth in
Section 10.01(g) or 10.02(f). To Purchaser's knowledge, the identity of
Purchaser or its Affiliates would not reasonably be expected to cause the
conditions set forth in Section 10.01(g) or 10.02(f) to fail to be satisfied
by the Termination Date.

or implied) on behalf of Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives in connection with the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, notwithstanding the delivery or
disclosure to Purchaser or its Representatives of any materials, documentation
or other information during the course of due diligence or any auction or
negotiation process (including information memoranda, VDR materials,
projections, estimates, management presentations, budgets and financial data

hours, reasonable access to all books, records, personnel, officers and
facilities of the Business (except that Purchaser shall not conduct any
environmental sampling or analysis of the sort customarily referred to as a
Phase II Environmental Assessment without the advance written consent of
Seller, which may be withheld in Seller's sole discretion, and without
executing a customary access and indemnity agreement in respect thereto);
provided, however, that any such access shall be conducted in a

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

84  

  

 

 

 

  

  

manner that complies with Section 6.03 and at Purchaser's expense, at a
reasonable time, under the reasonable supervision of Seller's personnel and in
such a manner as to maintain confidentiality and not to interfere with the
normal operations of the businesses of Seller and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any other agreement between
Purchaser and Seller executed on or prior to the date hereof, neither Seller
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to make available to
Purchaser or its Representatives, or provide Purchaser or its Representatives
with, (a) any consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return filed by Seller or
any of its Affiliates or predecessors, or any related material, except to the
extent that any such Tax Return or related material relates solely to the
Transferred Entities, the Business or the Transferred HHI Assets or (b) any
information if making such information available would (i) reasonably be
likely to result in a waiver of any attorney-client or other legal privilege,
or (ii) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
(including any confidentiality agreement to which Seller or any of its
Affiliates is a party) (it being understood that Seller shall cooperate in any
reasonable efforts and requests for waivers that would enable otherwise
required disclosure to Purchaser to occur without so jeopardizing privilege or
contravening such Law, duty or agreement). Subject to the preceding sentence
and applicable Law, Purchaser shall have the right to appoint up to two
designees (the "Purchaser Designees") who shall have the right from and after
the date hereof to be present at the headquarters of the Business at all times
during normal business hours (including by Seller causing sufficient office
space and assistance to be provided at such location to such persons) in order
for such designees to assist in transition planning and monitor compliance
with the terms of this Agreement, including Section 6.01, and Seller shall
promptly provide to each Purchaser Designee such access and shall promptly
furnish such information as such Purchaser Designee may reasonably request in
furtherance of the foregoing.

  

  

Section 6.03 Confidentiality; Publicity.

  

  

(a) Purchaser and Seller shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and their respective Representatives, to comply
with all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated as of July 9, 2012, between Seller and Purchaser (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"); provided, that such obligations shall be subject to any
exceptions expressly set forth herein, including the last sentence of Section
6.15(d). The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated
herein by reference (subject to any exceptions expressly set forth herein,
including the last sentence of Section 6.15(d)) and shall continue in full
force and effect and survive the First Closing and the Second Closing in
accordance with its terms. From and after the First Closing, the restrictions
on the use and disclosure of Evaluation Material (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement shall
not apply to Purchaser or its Affiliates and their respective Representatives
in respect of any information solely to the extent relating to the HHI
Business, the Transferred Entities, the Transferred Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities (other than TLM Philippines, the Transferred TLM Assets and the
Assumed TLM Liabilities). From and after the Second Closing, the restrictions
on the use and disclosure of Evaluation Material set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply to Purchaser or its Affiliates and
their respective employees, agents or representatives in respect of any
information solely to the extent relating to the TLM Business, TLM
Philippines, the Transferred TLM Assets and the Assumed TLM Liabilities. If
this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the First Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement, and Purchaser's obligations thereunder pursuant to
this Section 6.03, shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect in all
respects. In the event of any conflict between the Confidentiality Agreement
and this Agreement, this Agreement shall control until the termination of this
Agreement without the First Closing having occurred.

  

  

(b) The timing and content of the initial public announcement regarding this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby to the general public shall be mutually agreed upon in
advance by Seller and Purchaser; provided, that if any subsequent public
disclosure is required by applicable Law, U.S. GAAP or by the rules and
regulations of, or pursuant to any agreement of a stock exchange or trading
system to be made by Purchaser or Seller and would vary in any material
respect from the initial agreed upon public announcement, such party shall be
permitted to issue such public disclosure only if it has provided the other
party with reasonable advance notice and opportunity to review and comment on
such disclosure. Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause its Subsidiaries
(including the Transferred Entities) not to, issue any broadly distributed
communication of a general nature to employees of the Business (including
general communications relating to benefits and compensation) related to this
Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby without providing Purchaser
with reasonable advance notice and opportunity to review and comment on such
communication.

  

  

Section 6.04 Efforts and Actions to Cause the Closings to Occur.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closings, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, Purchaser and Seller shall (and each of them shall cause their
respective Affiliates to) use their respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done and
cooperate with each other in order to do, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Closings as promptly as practicable, including
using their reasonable best efforts: (i) to cause the preparation and filing
of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the
Closings and the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any
requisite approvals, authorizations, consents, orders, licenses, permits,
qualifications, exemptions or waivers by any third party or Governmental
Authority (including the formation and organization by Purchaser of a legal
entity in the Republic of China (Taiwan) that would acquire the Transferred
TLM Assets and assume the Assumed TLM Liabilities and the partial assignment
of, or grant of new licenses for the Business to replace the applicable
portion of, the Contracts set forth on Section 6.04(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule) and (ii) to cause the conditions to the First Closing and
Second Closing specified in Article IX and Article X, respectively, to be
satisfied. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
Purchaser and Seller agrees to make or cause to be made an appropriate filing
of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act within 10 days of
the date hereof and any filings or applications required under the Laws of any
non-U.S. jurisdiction as required with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby promptly after the date hereof. In addition, no party
hereto shall take any action after the date hereof that would reasonably be
expected to delay, hinder or otherwise obstruct the consummation of either of
the Closings, including any action that delays the obtaining of, or results in
not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any Governmental
Authority or other Person required to be obtained prior to either of the
Closings. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (i) (A)
Purchaser shall bear all the costs, expenses and fees incurred or payable to
any other Person in connection with obtaining such approvals, authorizations,
consents, orders, licenses, permits, qualifications, exemptions or waivers,
including filing fees under the HSR Act and under any other applicable
antitrust or competition Laws and (B) Seller shall bear all of the costs and
expenses incurred or payable to any third party in connection with obtaining
(x) the third party consents set forth in Section 9.02(f) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, (y) at Purchaser's request, the third party consents
necessary to obtain the partial assignment of, or grant of new licenses for
the Business to replace the applicable portion of, the Contracts set forth on
Section 6.04(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule; and (z) at Purchaser's
request, any other third party consents with respect to the assignment or
transfer of any Restricted Asset; provided, that (A) with respect to clause
(y), Seller shall not be obligated to spend in excess of One Million One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,100,000) in connection with obtaining such
consents, (B) with respect to clause (y) and (z), Seller shall not be
obligated to spend, in the aggregate, in excess of Two Million Three Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($2,300,000) in connection with obtaining such consents, and
(C) in the case of both clause (y) and (z), Seller shall only be obligated to
spend up to such amounts to the extent expressly requested by Purchaser in a
written notice setting forth the specified consents and the specific amounts
to be spent on each such consent, and (ii) all obligations of Purchaser to
obtain the Debt Financing or any other financing for the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed exclusively by Section 6.15 and not this
Section 6.04. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, nothing in this
Section 6.04(a) shall be construed to imply that Seller or any of its
Affiliates has any obligation to pay or deliver anything of value to secure
any third party consents.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

85  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(b) If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for
information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, then
such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon
as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request.

  

  

(c) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining the requisite approvals, consents
or orders of each applicable Governmental Authority, including:

  

  

(i) cooperating with each other in connection with filings under the HSR Act,
any foreign investments Laws or any other Laws;

  

  

(ii) subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.04(c), furnishing to the
other party all information within its possession that is reasonably required
for any application or other filing to be made by the other party pursuant to
the HSR Act, any foreign investment Laws or any other Laws in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

(iii) promptly notifying each other of any communications from or with any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

  

  

(iv) not agreeing to participate in any meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority in connection with Laws unless it consults with the
other party in advance, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority but subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.04(c), gives the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, in each case,
to the extent permitted by Law; and

  

  

(v) subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.04(c), consulting and
cooperating with one another in connection with all analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings
under or relating to the HSR Act, any foreign investment Laws or any other
Laws in connection with the Transaction Documents or any of the transactions
contemplated thereby.

  

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require Seller
to disclose to Purchaser any nonpublic information about itself, any of its
Affiliates or any of its or its Affiliates' respective businesses or
operations other than information relating to the Business, the Overhead and
Shared Services, and, to the extent reasonably required by Purchaser, the
Excluded Assets, the Excluded Transferred Entity Assets or Purchaser's right
to indemnification under Article XII.

  

  

(d) Prior to the Second Closing, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
to renew, or shall cause TLM Philippines to use its reasonable best efforts to
renew, the Pressure Vessel Permit in accordance with the requirements of
applicable Law.

  

  

(e) Between the date hereof and the Second Closing, to the extent reasonably
requested by Purchaser, Seller shall in good faith raise with Test-Rite any
comments provided by Purchaser to the license agreement to be executed in
connection with the sale of TLM Taiwan's "3G" business.

  

  

Section 6.05 Bulk Sales. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Seller and its
Subsidiaries with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws of any
jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Business to Purchaser and its
Affiliates. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its
Affiliates against any and all claims that may be asserted by third Persons
against Purchaser or its Affiliates as a result of noncompliance by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries with any such bulk transfer Law.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

86  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Section 6.06 Insurance.

  

  

(a) Except as provided in Section 6.06(c), (i) Purchaser shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates, including the Transferred Entities after the First
Closing and Second Closing, as applicable, not to, assert, by way of claim,
action, litigation or otherwise, any right to any Seller Policies or any
benefit under any such Seller Policies, and (ii) Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Transferred Entities) shall retain after the Closings all
right, title and interest in and to Seller Policies, including the right to
any credit or return premiums due, paid or payable in connection with the
termination thereof.

  

  

(b) Except as provided in Section 6.06(c), at the First Closing and the Second
Closing, as applicable, Purchaser shall release, and shall cause its
Affiliates, including the Transferred Entities, to release all rights to all
Seller Policies.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all claims and proceeds
actually paid out to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries under occurrence based
Seller Policies or under directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability
policies that are Seller Policies (in all cases, other than actual or de facto
self-insurance arrangements) after the First Closing or Second Closing, as
applicable, shall be for the benefit of Purchaser (and Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such
recoveries) to the extent such claims and proceeds are in respect of the
Business (in each case, other than the Excluded Assets and the Excluded
Transferred Entity Assets) arising from any event, act or omission prior to
the applicable Closing, and Seller shall cause such proceeds to be transferred
to Purchaser promptly after such proceeds are received by Seller after the
applicable Closing; provided, however, that such proceeds shall be for the
benefit of, and shall be kept by, Seller to the extent such proceeds are
reimbursements (x) for expenditures that have been made prior to the
applicable Closing by Seller or (y) that relate to Retained Liabilities. If
(i) Purchaser would be entitled to the proceeds of a claim made after the
applicable Closing under an occurrence based Seller Policy or under directors'
and officers' and fiduciary liability policies that are Seller Policies (other
than any actual or de facto self-insurance arrangement) relating to the period
prior to the applicable Closing and (ii) Purchaser informs Seller in a timely
manner of such claim, then Seller shall report and pursue such claim in a
manner that is at least as favorable to the claimant as the manner in which
Seller reports and pursues claims by itself or its then-existing Subsidiaries;
provided that, if the insurer disputes such claim, then Seller shall only be
required to contest such position of the insurer if Purchaser pays, without
right to reimbursement or indemnity from Seller, the reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of such contest (without regard to the
outcome of such dispute). With respect to insurance coverage written on a
claims made basis (other than directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability
policies), Seller and its Affiliates shall have no Liability to Purchaser and
its Affiliates or the Business under such insurance coverage in connection
with claims made after the applicable Closing and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in Section 12.04(a), Purchaser shall not be obligated to seek
recovery or make any claim under any such insurance coverage. From and after
the applicable Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (other
than the Transferred Entities) to, cause all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in favor of any present
or former director or officer of the Business (an "Employee Indemnified
Party") as provided in (A) the organizational documents of Seller and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities), or (B) agreements between
an Employee Indemnified Party and Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than the Transferred Entities, in each case in effect at the applicable
Closing Date, to survive the applicable Closing and to continue in full force
and effect for a period of not less than six years after the applicable
Closing Date, or, if longer, for such period as is set forth in any applicable
agreement with an Employee Indemnified Party in effect on the date of this
Agreement. Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, maintain in effect
the Seller Policies providing directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability
coverage for the Transferred Entities for the remaining term of such policies
and for six years following the applicable Closing shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates to not, enter into any renewal or replacement thereof that
would have the effect of excluding the Employee Indemnified Parties from
coverage thereunder.

  

  

(d) Purchaser shall cooperate as reasonably requested by Seller and its
Subsidiaries (at the expense of Seller) to obtain the return or release of all
bonds, security, credit support, parent guaranties, and indemnifications given
by Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than by the Transferred Entities without
any credit support from Seller and its Subsidiaries, other than the
Transferred Entities) in connection with the Business; provided, that neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closings, the
applicable Transferred Entities) shall be obligated to make any payments or
incur any costs or expenses or post any bond, security, letter of credit,
guaranty or other collateral or provide any indemnification in connection
therewith. If, notwithstanding Purchaser's compliance with the foregoing
sentence, any such bonds, security, credit support, parent guaranties or
indemnifications remain outstanding following the applicable Closing,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Subsidiaries from
and against all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with such
bonds, security, credit support, parent guaranties or indemnifications.

Section 6.07 Certain Services and Benefits Provided by Affiliates;
Intercompany Matters; Further Assurances.

  

  

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the Business currently receives Overhead and
Shared Services from other business units of Seller and its Subsidiaries.
Purchaser further acknowledges that, except as otherwise expressly provided in
the Supply Agreements, the HHI Transition Services Agreement and the TLM
Transition Services Agreement or as set forth in Section 6.07(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, (i) as it relates to the HHI Business, all such Overhead
and Shared Services shall cease, and any agreement with Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller in respect thereof shall terminate, as of the First
Closing Date, and (ii) as it relates to the TLM Business, all such Overhead
and Shared Services shall cease, and any agreement with Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller in respect thereof shall terminate, as of the Second
Closing Date, without any further Liability to Purchaser, the Business or any
Transferred Entity.

  

  

(b) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements or as set forth in Section 6.07(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, Purchaser and Seller agree and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries or, in the case of Purchaser, its Affiliates, to agree (and
Purchaser shall cause the Transferred Entities to agree) that, from and after
the First Closing, all rights and obligations of any party under all Contracts
between Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities and
the Business), on the one hand, and the Transferred Entities and the Business,
on the other hand, (including all intercompany receivables and payables
between such entities) shall terminate and be cancelled without any further
Liability, including Liability relating to any period prior to the First
Closing (except with respect to Liabilities relating to TLM Philippines, the
Transferred TLM Assets or the Assumed TLM Liabilities, which shall terminate
and be cancelled without any further Liability, including Liability relating
to any period prior to the Second Closing, as of the Second Closing). For the
avoidance of doubt, immediately prior to the applicable Closing, Seller shall
cause any Indebtedness owing from any of the Transferred Entities to Sellers
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities) to be
discharged or released without any Liability to Purchaser, the Business or any
Transferred Entity.

  

  

(c) Each of the parties shall execute and deliver such documents and other
papers and take such further actions as may reasonably be required to carry
out the provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and give
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the
execution and delivery of such assignments, deeds and other documents as may
be necessary to transfer any Transferred Assets or Purchased Companies Equity
Interests as provided in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the
parties shall prepare, execute and deliver whatever reasonable supplemental
agreements, instruments or other documentation is necessary to consummate the
transfer of the Purchased Companies Equity Interests in accordance with the
applicable Laws of the jurisdictions under which the Transferred Entities are
organized and on and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in such agreements,
instruments and documentation, nothing in such agreements, instruments and
documentation shall supersede or otherwise amend or modify the rights and
obligations provided for in this Agreement and, in the event of any conflict
or alleged conflict between such agreements, instruments and documentation, on
the one hand, and this Agreement, on the other hand, the terms and conditions
of this Agreement (including Article XII and Article XIII) shall prevail.
Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the First Closing (or, with
respect to TLM Philippines, the Transferred TLM Assets or the Assumed TLM
Liabilities, the Second Closing) (i) Seller shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) do all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law as reasonably requested by Purchaser (A) to put Purchaser in actual
possession, ownership and control of the Transferred Assets and Purchaser
shall cooperate with Seller for such purpose and (B) to assure that Seller and
its Subsidiaries, rather than Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, are the
obligors in respect of all Retained Liabilities and (ii) Purchaser shall do
all things necessary, proper and advisable under applicable Law as reasonably
requested by Seller (A) (at Seller's expense) to transfer to Seller (or such
other Person as Seller shall indicate) any Excluded Assets and Excluded
Transferred Entity Assets that Purchaser, any Transferred Entity or any of
their respective Affiliates may possess, (B) to assure that Purchaser, rather
than Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, is the obligor in respect of all
Assumed Liabilities, and Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser for such
purposes and (C) except as otherwise provided in the Trademark License
Agreement, the HHI Supply Agreement and in this Section 6.07(c) and Section
6.08, to cease the use or deployment by the Business of those names and
Trademarks set forth in Section 6.07(c)(ii)(C) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule ("Retained Trademarks"). Purchaser shall, upon the request of Seller,
and at no cost to Seller (other than reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses),
make the Transferred Employees available at reasonable times and cooperate in
all reasonable respects with Seller and its Subsidiaries in the preparation
for, and defense of, any lawsuit, arbitration or other Action (whether
disclosed or not disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule) filed or claimed
against Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of the respective agents,
directors, officers and employees of Seller and its Affiliates, whether
currently pending or asserted in the future, concerning the operation or
conduct of the Business prior to the applicable Closing Date (including in
each case by making Transferred Employees available at reasonable times to
provide information and discovery documentation, take depositions and
testify). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall (i)
for a period of six months after the applicable Closing Date, have the right
to use any existing signs, billboards, advertisements, vehicle and equipment
markings, stationary, letterhead, sales literature, invoices, purchase orders,
forms, business cards and other media, including respective online material,
bearing or incorporating any names listed on Section 6.07(c)(ii)(C) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, (ii) have the right to use any existing
containers, product tags, labels, packaging or other similar materials bearing
or incorporating any names listed on Section 6.07(c)(ii)(C) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule until the exhaustion of such materials, and (iii) within a
period of ninety (90) days after such Closing Date, change all corporate names
incorporating any of the Retained Trademarks; and, for the avoidance of doubt,
at the end of the foregoing time-periods, Purchaser and its Affiliate shall
cease the sale, distribution or use of any such products, materials or names
bearing or incorporating any of the Retained Trademarks (except as expressly
permitted under the Trademark License Agreement, the HHI Supply Agreement or
this Agreement). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall
(x) for a period of six months after the Second Closing Date, have the right
to use any existing signs, billboards, advertisements, vehicle and equipment
markings, stationary, letterhead, sales literature, invoices, purchase orders,
forms, business cards and other media, including respective online material,
bearing or incorporating any Trademarks within the Transferred TLM Assets, (y)
have the right to use any existing containers, product tags, labels, packaging
or other similar materials bearing or incorporating any Trademarks within the
Transferred TLM Assets until the exhaustion of such materials, and (z) within
a period of ninety (90) days after the Second Closing Date, change all
corporate names incorporating any of the Trademarks within the Transferred TLM
Assets; and, for the avoidance of doubt, at the end of the foregoing time-
periods, Seller and its Affiliates shall cease the sale, distribution or use
of any such products, materials or names bearing or incorporating any of the
Trademarks within the Transferred TLM Assets.

Section 6.08 Other Intellectual Property.

  

  

(a) Effective as of the applicable Closing Date, and excluding any Trademarks,
with respect to any Intellectual Property included in the Excluded Assets or
the Excluded Transferred Entity Assets owned or licensed (to the extent that
such Intellectual Property can be sublicensed on the terms herein without any
consent, payment or other consideration and without any relinquishment or
forbearance of any rights, and, in any event, excluding any software or
Intellectual Property used for Overhead and Shared Services) by Seller and its
Affiliates as of the applicable Closing Date that is used, held for use by or
necessary to the operation of the Business as of the applicable Closing Date
(including with respect to products in development), Seller does hereby, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, grant Purchaser in and to such Intellectual
Property a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free
license to use, reproduce, publish, display, perform, make, have made, sell,
offer, import or otherwise exploit, solely in connection with the Business,
any product, process, work or service.

  

  

(b) Effective as of the Second Closing Date, and excluding any Trademarks,
with respect to any Intellectual Property included in the Transferred TLM
Assets owned by Purchaser as of the Second Closing Date that is used, held for
use by or necessary to the operation of the business of Seller and its
Affiliates, other than the Business, as of the Second Closing Date (including
with respect to products in development), Purchaser does hereby, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, grant Seller and its Affiliates in and to such
Intellectual Property a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive,
royalty-free license to use, reproduce, publish, display, perform, make, have
made, sell, offer, import or otherwise exploit, solely outside of the
Business, any product, process, work or service.

  

  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, Seller and its Affiliates have no rights to
use the Trademarks set forth on Schedule A to the SmartKey Trademark License
Agreement other than pursuant to the terms of the SmartKey Trademark License
Agreement and the HHI Supply Agreement.

  

  

(d) Section 6.08 shall not obligate any party to deliver any further
information or tangible materials to the other party beyond that set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement. Each party shall use its reasonable efforts to
maintain any trade secrets or other confidential information contained within
such information or materials as confidential, including refraining from
disclosing such trade secrets or confidential information to any other Person
other than pursuant to reasonable confidentiality terms.

  

  

(e) A party may sublicense the rights contained within Section 6.08(a) or
Section 6.08(b) without prior written consent only in a manner consistent with
how such party sublicenses its own comparable Intellectual Property including
by the inclusion of reasonable confidentiality terms.

  

  

(f) No party may assign the rights contained within Section 6.08(a) or Section
6.08(b) without the prior written consent of the other party, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, that either
party may assign such rights in whole or in part without the prior written
consent of the other party (i) in connection with any merger, public offering,
consolidation, reorganization, or sale of substantially all of the assets or
any divisions, businesses, operating units or portion of such party or (ii) to
such party's Affiliates.

  

  

(g) For the period commencing upon the First Closing Date and ending upon the
date five (5) years after the First Closing Date, in the event that either
party (i) becomes aware that it does not have in its possession certain
technical schematics, designs, manuals, records and other documentation owned
by either party and used in the operation of the Business or the operations of
Seller's or its controlled Affiliates' businesses as of the applicable Closing
Date (in each case, including with respect to products in development)
("Materials") and (ii) has a reasonable belief that the other party may have
such Materials in its possession, then, upon such party's request, the other
party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make copies of such
Materials available to the requesting party for their use in connection with
their business without any further consideration owed in connection therewith.

  

  

(h) Prior to the applicable Closing Date, Seller shall revise Section
1.01(n)(3), (5), (6), Section 1.01(y)(v), and Section 4.14(a)(1) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule to ensure that all the Intellectual Property listed on any
of the foregoing sections is correctly disclosed on one of the applicable
foregoing sections of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. A failure by Seller to
so revise Section 1.01(n)(3), (5), (6), Section 1.01(y)(v), and Section
4.14(a)(1) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, if such revision is necessary to
make any such section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule correct, shall be
considered a breach of Section 4.14 for the purposes of this Agreement,
including Article XII.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

89  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(i) Prior to the First Closing Date, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts (without payment or other consideration and without any relinquishment
or forbearance of any right) to terminate that certain License Agreement,
dated as of December 1, 2011, by and between the Stanley Works Pty. Ltd. and
Gainsborough Hardware Industries Limited.

  

  

Section 6.09 Ancillary Agreements.

  

  

(a) On the First Closing Date, each of Purchaser and Seller shall (or, if
applicable, each shall cause its Subsidiaries or, in the case of Purchaser,
its designated Affiliates to) execute and deliver each of the HHI Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party if such HHI Ancillary Agreement has not been
previously executed.

  

  

(b) On the Second Closing Date, each of Purchaser and Seller shall (or, if
applicable, each shall cause its Subsidiaries or, in the case of Purchaser,
its designated Affiliates to) execute and deliver each of the TLM Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party if such TLM Ancillary Agreement has not been
previously executed.

  

  

Section 6.10 Maintenance of Books and Records; Cooperation. After the First
Closing (or, to the extent it relates to TLM Philippines, the Transferred TLM
Assets or the Assumed TLM Liabilities, the Second Closing), each of the
parties hereto shall preserve, until at least the seventh anniversary of the
First Closing Date or Second Closing Date, as applicable, all pre-closing
records (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any loss run information with
respect to Seller Policies, and any updates thereto) possessed or to be
possessed by such party to the extent relating to the Business, the Overhead
and Shared Services or the Excluded Transferred Entity Assets. After the First
Closing Date (or, to the extent it relates to TLM Philippines, the Transferred
TLM Assets or the Assumed TLM Liabilities, the Second Closing) and up until at
least the seventh anniversary of the First Closing Date or Second Closing
Date, as applicable, upon any reasonable request from a party hereto or its
Representatives, the party holding such records shall (a) provide to the
requesting party or its Representatives reasonable access to such records
during normal business hours and (b) permit the requesting party or its
Representatives to make copies of such records, in each case at no cost to the
requesting party or its Representatives (other than for reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses); provided, however, that nothing herein shall require either
party to disclose any information to the other if such disclosure would
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or contravene any
applicable Law (it being understood that each party shall cooperate in any
reasonable efforts and requests for waivers that would enable otherwise
required disclosure to the other party to occur without so jeopardizing
privilege or contravening such Law, duty or agreement). Such records may be
sought under this Section 6.10 for any reasonable purpose, including to the
extent reasonably required in connection with the audit, accounting, financial
reporting, tax, litigation, federal, foreign, or state securities disclosure
or other similar needs of the party seeking such records. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any and all such records may be destroyed by a party if such
destroying party sends to the other party hereto written notice of its intent
to destroy such records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the
records to be destroyed; such records may then be destroyed after the 60th day
following such notice unless the other party hereto notifies the destroying
party that such other party desires to obtain possession of such records, in
which event the destroying party at requesting party's expense shall transfer
the records to such requesting party and such requesting party shall pay all
reasonable expenses of the destroying party in connection therewith. In
addition, following the applicable Closing, each party agrees to provide, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to provide,
such cooperation and assistance to the other party, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives (including, for the avoidance of doubt, such
party's auditors), as may be reasonably requested by such other party upon
reasonable advance written notice, in connection with the audit, accounting,
financial reporting, tax, litigation, federal, foreign or state securities
disclosure or other similar needs of such requesting party; provided, that
such cooperation and assistance shall be provided at the requesting party's
expense. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the
First Closing, Seller shall, at Purchaser's expense, provide such cooperation
and assistance to Purchaser as may reasonably requested by Purchaser in
writing in connection with the termination of the Chinese Joint Venture
Agreement and the termination and winding down of the Chinese Joint Venture on
or prior to December 31, 2015, including participating in any negotiations or
discussions with Purchaser and Zhongshan Xiaolan Industrial Company or any
applicable Governmental Authority.

  

  

Section 6.11 Deletion of Non-Transferred Software. Purchaser agrees that,
following the applicable Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause each
of its Affiliates to instruct its and their employees not to use any third-
party software loaded on the Equipment included in the Transferred Assets or
the assets of any Transferred Entity as of the applicable Closing Date if such
software is not included in the Transferred Assets or the assets of such
Transferred Entity or licensed to Purchaser for such use, except as otherwise
provided in the applicable Transition Services Agreement. Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (at Purchaser's expense) as soon as is
reasonably practical following the applicable Closing Date, to delete all such
software from any of the Equipment on which it is installed, except as
otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement.

Section 6.12 Endorsement of Checks. Seller hereby authorizes Purchaser
following the applicable Closing to endorse for deposit only its name on and
collect for Purchaser's account any checks received in payment of any accounts
receivable included in the Transferred Assets, and any refunds of deposits,
prepaid expenses and similar amounts included in the Transferred Assets.

  

  

Section 6.13 Divestment of the Business. For a period of three years following
the First Closing, except to the extent relating to the manufacturing and sale
of Products described in clause (c) of the definition of "Restricted
Activities," Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) not to, directly or
indirectly, sell, transfer, lease, license or convey all or any material
portion of the Business, the Transferred Entities, the Transferred Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities, to the Person identified in Section 6.13 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule or any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled Affiliates
wherever located; provided, however that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, nothing in this Section 6.13 shall prohibit (a)
Purchaser from consummating a Change of Control (as such term is defined in
the Indenture relating to the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2020, as filed with the
SEC on May 9, 2012, as may be amended or supplemented from time to time)
involving the Person identified in Section 6.13 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled Affiliates wherever located
or (b) a sale, transfer, lease, license or conveyance of all or any portion of
the Business to the Person identified in Section 6.13 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled Affiliates wherever located
(i) at the direction of the applicable lenders during the continuance of an
event of default under the definitive agreements for the Debt Financing, or
(ii) upon the exercise of remedies by the applicable lenders under the
definitive agreements for the Debt Financing.

  

  

Section 6.14 TLM Acquisition.

  

  

(a) Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
the TLM Acquisition as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated as of
the date hereof, without waiver or modification, except to the extent the
failure to take such actions or do or cause such things to be done would not
have an adverse effect on Purchaser and except as otherwise consented to by
Purchaser in writing, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the right to elect or appoint the
majority of the board of directors of TLM Taiwan as soon as practicable
following the date hereof, including by causing TLM Taiwan to hold a special
shareholder meeting for the election of directors, and Seller shall, and shall
cause its applicable Subsidiaries to elect or appoint the majority of the
board of directors of TLM Taiwan as soon as practicable after obtaining the
right to do so. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period following the date hereof until the earlier of the Second
Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms,
Seller agrees to (i) keep Purchaser reasonably informed of any material
developments, events, and occurrences relating to the TLM Acquisition, (ii)
provide Purchaser with periodic updates regarding progress on the TLM
Acquisition, and (iii) consult with Purchaser in good faith prior to making
any material decision or taking any material action with respect to the TLM
Acquisition or the TLM Business.

  

  

(b) Between the date hereof and the Second Closing, Seller shall not undertake
any investigation, improvements or other work with regard to the wastewater
treatment system (the "WWTP") or air emission controls at the Tong Lung Site
without (i) providing a written description of the proposed work to Purchaser,
(ii) affording Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to evaluate such proposed
work, and (iii) obtaining Purchaser's prior written consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, to such work. Any such
improvements to the WWTP or air emission control system shall comply with all
applicable Environmental Laws and shall be based on commercially reasonable
decisions as to the nature of such improvements consistent with those that
would be undertaken by an operator that was not selling such facility. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not have any liability or obligation to
Purchaser following the Second Closing for the matters described in this
Section 6.14(b), except to the extent (x) such matter is a Retained
Environmental Liability, or (y) such liability or obligation relates to a
breach of this Section 6.14, subject, in each case, to the applicable
limitations in Article XII.

Section 6.15 Financing.

  

  

(a) Purchaser shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or replace, the Debt Financing
Commitment, without the prior written consent of Seller, if such amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement (i) (A) reduces the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount) to an amount that is below an amount that, assuming
the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in Article III
and Article IV, is sufficient to complete the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and pay all fees and amounts in connection with this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
or (B) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise adversely expands,
amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing,
in the case of this clause (B), in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to (1) materially delay or prevent either the First Closing or the Second
Closing, (2) materially delay or impair the availability of the Debt Financing
at the First Closing or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
release of the Estimated TLM Purchase Price from the TLM Purchase Price Escrow
Account at the Second Closing or materially impede the satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing at the First Closing or (3)
otherwise materially adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto (collectively, the "Restricted
Financing Commitment Amendments") (provided that, subject to the limitations
set forth in this Section 6.15, Purchaser may amend the Debt Financing
Commitment (I) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of
the date hereof, but only if the addition of such additional parties,
individually or in the aggregate, would not result in the occurrence of a
Restricted Financing Commitment Amendment, or (II) in connection with an
alternative financing as contemplated by clause (b) of this Section 6.15) or
(ii) results in the early termination of the Debt Financing Commitment.

  

  

(b) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitment,
including using its reasonable best efforts to (1) maintain in effect the Debt
Financing Commitment (including by complying with so-called "flex" provisions)
until the funding of the Debt Financing at or prior to the First Closing, (2)
satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain a waiver of) all conditions to obtaining
the Debt Financing at the First Closing as set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment (other than those that are solely within the control of Seller and
its Subsidiaries) and comply with all of its material obligations thereunder,
(3) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive agreements (which with respect
to the bridge facility documentation shall not be required until reasonably
necessary in connection with the funding of the Debt Financing) with respect
to such Debt Financing on the terms and conditions (including the "flex"
provisions) contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment (and provide
executed copies of such definitive agreements to Seller) or on other terms in
the aggregate materially no less favorable to Purchaser or the interests of
Seller, as to conditionality, than the terms and conditions in the Debt
Financing Commitment (provided that in no event shall any such definitive
agreement contain terms (other than those included in the Debt Financing
Commitment) that would constitute Restricted Financing Commitment Amendments),
(4) fully pay any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt
Financing Commitment, and (5) upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
the Debt Financing Commitment, consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to
the First Closing. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment, Purchaser shall promptly notify
Seller and shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources for such portion on terms and conditions (x) not
materially less favorable to Purchaser than the Debt Financing Commitment, (y)
with conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing not materially less
favorable to the interests of Seller than those included in the Debt Financing
Commitment, and (z) in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the payment of the Estimated HHI Purchaser
Price, the Estimated TLM Purchase Price, the amounts to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.04 and Section 2.05 (if any) and all related fees and expenses
promptly following the occurrence of such event, and in any event prior to or
on the First Closing Date, if obtained, Purchaser shall promptly deliver to
Seller true and complete copies of a new financing commitment pursuant to
which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide Purchaser
with any portion of the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably
informed and in reasonable detail with respect to all material developments
concerning the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing of (i) any breach
or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or
default) by any party to the Debt Financing Commitment of which Purchaser has
become aware, which breach or default if not cured could reasonably be
expected to result in the unavailability of the Debt Financing or any
termination of any of the Debt Financing Commitment, (ii) of the receipt by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or their respective employees, agents or
representatives of any notice or other communication from any Person with
respect to any (x) actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment or any definitive
agreement related thereto or (y) material dispute or disagreement between or
among any parties to any Financing Commitment or any definitive agreement
related thereto, and (iii) if for any reason Purchaser believes in good faith
that (1) there is (or there is reasonably likely to be) a dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or
any definitive agreement related thereto or (2) there is a material
possibility that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
financing contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment on the terms, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or
the definitive agreements related thereto. References in this Agreement to
"Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment as permitted by this Section 6.15 to be amended, modified
or replaced (including, replacement with alternative financing and alternative
financing commitments pursuant to this Section 6.15) and references to "Debt
Financing Commitment" shall include such documents as permitted by this
Section 6.15 to be amended, modified or replaced (including replacement with
alternative financing commitments pursuant to this Section 6.15), in each case
from and after such amendment, modification or replacement.

(c) Unless otherwise provided below, prior to the First Closing, Seller and
its Subsidiaries shall provide to Purchaser, and shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective directors, officers, employees,
consultants, agents, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other
representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to provide to Purchaser, all
cooperation that is reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the
Debt Financing, including: (i) participating in a reasonable number of

to other transactions of this size and nature) information (including
financial information, other than as provided pursuant to clause (1) above),
to the extent reasonably available to Seller and its Subsidiaries, regarding
the Transferred Entities and the HHI Business as may be reasonably requested
by Purchaser to be necessary in order to consummate the arrangement and
borrowings of loans and offerings of debt securities contemplated by the Debt
Financing (it being understood that the failure to provide audited financial
statements as of and for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2012 prior
to December 7, 2012 or audited financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 29, 2012 prior to March 8, 2013 shall not be deemed a breach of
this Section 6.15(c)(ii)), (iii) assisting with the preparation of materials
for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents
required in connection with the Debt Financing, including reviewing and
commenting on Purchaser's draft of a business description and "Management's
Discussion and Analysis" of the financial statements to be included in
offering documents relating to the Debt Financing, (iv) before the First
Closing and, to the extent reasonably necessary to allow Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates to consummate a Rule 144A bond offering, providing customary
management representation letters in connection with the preparation of
financial statements and other financial data of the Business and the
Transferred Entities and requesting accountants' consents in connection with
the use of the Business's and the Transferred Entities' financial statements
in offering documents for a Rule 144A bond offering, (v) using reasonable best
efforts to assist Purchaser in connection with its preparation of pro forma
financial information to the extent required for a Rule 144A bond offering (or
reasonably requested by the Financing Sources) to be included in any offering
documents (including, without limitation, customary estimates, forecasts,
projections and other forward-looking financial information regarding the
further performance of the Business, to the extent required for a Rule 144A
bond offering or reasonably requested by the Financing Sources), (vi)
executing and delivering as of the First Closing, on behalf of the Transferred
Entities and the Business, any necessary pledge and security documents and
otherwise reasonably facilitating the granting of a security interest (and
perfection thereof) in collateral, guarantees, mortgages, other definitive
financing documents or other certificates or documents as may reasonably be
requested by Purchaser; provided that any obligations contained in all such
agreements and documents shall be subject to the occurrence of the First
Closing (or Second Closing in the case of TLM Philippines) and effective no
earlier than the First Closing (or Second Closing in the case of TLM
Philippines), (vii) obtaining a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of
the HHI Business with respect to solvency matters (to the extent relating to
the HHI Business, but not other operations or holdings of Purchaser or its
Affiliates) to the extent required by the Financing Sources, customary
authorization letters with respect to the bank information memoranda and
consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Debt Financing, (viii) taking all reasonable actions necessary to permit
the prospective lenders involved in the Debt Financing and the Financing

accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purposes
of establishing collateral arrangements as of the First Closing and to assist
with other collateral audits, (ix) providing reasonable assistance to
Purchaser for Purchaser to establish bank and other accounts, blocked account
agreements, and lock box arrangements for the Transferred Entities to the
extent necessary in connection with the collateral arrangements to be entered
into in connection with the Debt Financing, (x) taking all corporate actions,
subject to the occurrence of the First Closing, reasonably requested by
Purchaser that are necessary or customary to permit the consummation of the
Debt Financing, (xi) providing all documentation and other information about
the Business and the Transferred Entities as is required by applicable "know

using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants' comfort letters (it being
understood, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, that,
as a result of the potential for the preparation of audited financial
statements as of and for the nine-month period ending September 29, 2012 and
as of and for the 12-month period ending December 29, 2012, such comfort
letters need not provide "negative assurance" comfort with respect to
unaudited financial data or statements relating to the HHI Business as of
dates or for periods ending between July 1, 2012 to September 28, 2012 and
September 30, 2012 to December 28, 2012, respectively), legal opinions,

Purchaser with a preliminary closing balance sheet with respect to the HHI
Business as of the First Closing Date and within ten (10) Business Days after
the Second Closing Date, providing Purchaser with a preliminary closing
balance sheet with respect to the TLM Business as of the Second Closing Date,
in each case, that are prepared on a basis consistent with the Financial
Statements with respect to the assets and liabilities conveyed to Purchaser,
and assisting Purchaser and Purchaser's registered independent public
accounting firm in connection with Purchaser's accounting firm's audit
procedures pertaining to such closing balance sheets; provided, however, that
nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere
unreasonably with the Business or operations of Seller and its Subsidiaries;
and provided, further, that Seller, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall not be required to authorize, execute, deliver or
perform under any agreement with respect to the Debt Financing that is not
contingent upon the occurrence of the First Closing (or Second Closing in the
case of TLM Philippines) or that would be effective prior to or simultaneous
with the First Closing (or Second Closing in the case of TLM Philippines).
Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fees or make any other out-of-pocket payment or
incur any other liability or obligation or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the foregoing in
connection with the Debt Financing. Seller, on behalf of the Business, hereby
consents to the use of the Business's logos in connection with the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment; provided, that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably
likely to, harm or disparage the Business, Seller or its Subsidiaries.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

93  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(d) Prior to the First Closing, Seller and its applicable Subsidiaries shall
timely file SEC documents and other materials with the SEC to the extent
required by the SEC in accordance with Law to the extent such SEC documents
relate specifically to any Transferred Entities or the Business. In addition,
if, in connection with a marketing effort contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment prior to the First Closing, Purchaser reasonably requests Seller to
file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains
material non-public information with respect to the Business and the
Transferred Entities, which Purchaser reasonably determines (in consultation
with Seller) to include in a customary offering memorandum for the Debt
Financing, then, upon Seller's review of and reasonable satisfaction with such
filing, Seller shall either (A) file such Current Report on Form 8-K or (B)
permit Purchaser to file a Current Report on Form 8-K containing the same
information.

  

  

(e) None of Seller, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
shall be required to take any action that would subject such Person to actual
or potential liability, to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment
or other similar fee or make any other payment or incur any other liability or
provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Debt
Financing or their performance of their respective obligations under this
Section 6.15 and any information utilized in connection therewith. Purchaser
shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing and the performance of their respective obligations under this
Section 6.15 or any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
arising from information provided by or on behalf of Seller or its
Subsidiaries in writing, specifically for use in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing or the performance of their respective
obligations under this Section 6.15), in each case other than to the extent
any of the foregoing arises from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Seller or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates
and Representatives. Purchaser shall, promptly upon the written request of
Seller, advance or reimburse (as requested) Seller and its Subsidiaries for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs that have been incurred by
Seller and its Subsidiaries (including those of their respective
Representatives) in connection with such cooperation.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Section 6.15 shall require, and in no event shall
the reasonable best efforts of Purchaser be deemed or construed to require,
Purchaser to (i) to pay any fees in excess of those contemplated in the Debt
Financing Commitment (whether to secure waiver or any conditions contained
therein or otherwise), (ii) amend or waive any of the terms or conditions
hereof, (iii) consummate the First Closing at any time prior to the date
determined in accordance with Section 2.06(a) or (iv) except to the extent
required by the Debt Financing Commitment, use any cash or other assets on its
balance sheet to pay any portion of the Purchase Price (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, payment of any Purchaser Termination Fee, to the extent
applicable).

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller acknowledges and agrees that, except as and to the extent set forth in
Section 6.15(a) and Section 6.15(b), neither Purchaser nor any other Person
(including any Financing Source, except to the extent set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment) has agreed to or is subject to any obligation, covenant
or agreement to obtain or arrange the Debt Financing or financing from an
alternative source to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller acknowledges and agrees that, except as and to the extent set forth in
Section 5.07, neither Purchaser nor any other Person is making or has made any
representation or warranty (whether express or implied) on behalf of
Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of their respective employees, agents or
representatives (including any Financing Source, except to the extent set
forth in the Debt Financing Commitment) with respect to the Debt Financing or
their ability to arrange, or the availability of, the Debt Financing or
financing from an alternative source to enable the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(h) After the First Closing, if reasonably requested by Purchaser, Seller and
its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the auditors
that have audited their audited financial statements to permit the filing of
such financial statements (and corresponding reports) with the SEC if so
required in connection with a registration statement.

Section 6.16 Certain Covenants.

  

  

(a) As consideration for and to induce Purchaser to pay the consideration set
forth in this Agreement, during the Restricted Period, Seller shall, and
Seller shall cause each other Restricted Party not to, directly or indirectly,
engage in any Restricted Activities that are not Permitted Activities;
provided, that nothing in this Section 6.16 shall prohibit any Restricted
Party from acquiring (by asset purchase, stock purchase, merger or
consolidation) a business that engages in Restricted Activities that are not
Permitted Activities (such business, an "Acquired Competitive Business") and
thereafter engaging in, or owning, operating, controlling, managing, financing
or participating in, or attempting to do any of the foregoing, with respect to
such Acquired Competitive Business, if:

  

  

(i) such Acquired Competitive Business generated less than either (A) thirty
percent (30%) of the net revenues of the combined businesses that are being
acquired as part of the same transaction or related transactions in which such
Acquired Competitive Business is being acquired (measured for the last 12
months for which such financial data are available prior to the execution of
the definitive agreement for such acquisition (or the date of the consummation
of such acquisition if there is no such definitive agreement)), or (B) $50
million in net revenues (measured for the last 12 months for which such
financial data are available prior to the execution of the definitive
agreement for such acquisition (or the date of the consummation of such
acquisition if there is no such definitive agreement)); and

  

  

(ii) Seller shall, only in the event that neither the condition in clause
(i)(A) nor the condition in clause (i)(B) of this proviso were satisfied,
promptly pursue and thereafter engage in one or more transactions that result
in the sale, in a commercially reasonable manner, (or, at Seller's election in
its sole discretion, shut down) of such Acquired Competitive Business to the
extent necessary so that the remaining Acquired Competitive Business would
have satisfied either the condition in clause (i)(A) or the condition in
clause (i)(B) of this proviso (for the avoidance of doubt the denominator to
be used for purposes of measuring the condition in clause (i)(A) pursuant to
this subparagraph (ii) shall be the same denominator used in subparagraph
(i)).

  

  

Seller represents, stipulates and acknowledges on behalf of itself and the
other Restricted Parties that: (x) the restrictive covenants contained in this
Section 6.16(a) are a material inducement to Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby for which the
Restricted Parties will receive a substantial financial benefit, and (y) it
would impair the goodwill acquired by Purchaser and reduce the value of the
Business obtained by Purchaser through the transactions contemplated hereby if
such Restricted Party were to use its ability and knowledge in competition
with Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Business, or to otherwise breach the
obligations contained in this Section 6.16(a).

  

  

(b) During the period commencing on the First Closing Date, or, if later, the
Second Closing Date, and ending three (3) years following the First Closing
Date, or, if later, the Second Closing Date (provided, that such period shall
be extended by any period in which a Restricted Party is in violation of the
covenants of this Section 6.16(b)), Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause
each other Restricted Party not to, directly or indirectly:

  

  

(i) contact, solicit or assist in the solicitation of, employ or retain any
individual who is on the applicable Closing Date an employee of the Business,
unless such individual is (A) no longer in the employ of the Business, (B)
contacted or solicited through general non-targeted solicitation or
advertisement in a newspaper, online or through an employment agency or (C)
one of four such individuals hired by the Restricted Parties, in the
aggregate, during the term covered by this Section 6.16(b)(i) so long such
individual was not solicited in violation of this Section 6.16(b)(i); or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

95  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(ii) contact, solicit, assist in the solicitation of, or cause any supplier,
licensee or service provider with whom the Business has a commercial
relationship, whether by contract or otherwise, to reduce, discontinue or
alter in a manner adverse to the Business, such commercial relationship.

  

  

(c) During the period commencing on the First Closing Date and ending three
(3) years following the First Closing Date, or, if later, the Second Closing
Date (provided, that such period shall be extended by any period in which
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled Affiliates is in violation
of the covenants of this Section 6.16(c)), Purchaser shall not, and Purchaser
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Controlled Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, contact, solicit or assist in the solicitation of,
employ or retain any individual who is on the Second Closing Date an employee
of TLM Taiwan or Lucky Samoa and identified on Section 6.16(c) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, unless such individual is (i) no longer in the employ of
TLM Taiwan or Lucky Samoa, (ii) contacted or solicited through general non-
targeted solicitation or advertisement in a newspaper, online or through an
employment agency or (iii) one of four such individuals hired by the
Purchaser, its Subsidiaries and Controlled Affiliates, in the aggregate,
during the term covered by this Section 6.16(c) so long as such individual was
not solicited in violation of this Section 6.16(c).

  

  

(d) Each of the parties has carefully read this Section 6.16 and considered
the restraints imposed upon, on the one hand, Seller and the other Restricted
Parties and, on the other hand, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and Controlled
Affiliates, and is in full accord as to the necessity of such restrictive
covenants for the reasonable and proper protection of, on the one hand,
Purchaser, its Affiliates and the Business and, on the other hand, Seller and
its Affiliates and their respective businesses, and agrees that each
commitment and restraint imposed by the provisions of this Section 6.16 is
fair and reasonable with respect to subject matter, geographic scope and time
period. It is expressly understood and agreed that although Seller and
Purchaser consider such covenants to be fair and reasonable, if a judicial
determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or
any other restriction contained in this Section 6.16 is an invalid or
unenforceable restriction against Seller, any of the Restricted Parties,
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled Affiliates, the provisions
of this Section 6.16 shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed amended to
apply to such maximum time and to such maximum extent as such court may
judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any
court of competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended
so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability
of any of the other restrictions contained herein, which shall be given full
force and effect without regard to such finding.

  

  

(e) Seller acknowledges that it has informed each of the other Restricted
Parties of the restrictive covenants contained in this Section 6.16, to the
extent applicable, and has directed each of the other Restricted Parties to
comply with all of the provisions of this Section 6.16, to the extent
applicable. Seller hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons from and against any and all Losses suffered, incurred or
sustained by any of them arising out of or in connection with the breach by
any Restricted Party.

  

  

(f) Purchaser acknowledges that it has informed each of its Subsidiaries and
Controlled Affiliates of the restrictive covenants contained in this Section
6.16, to the extent applicable, and has directed each of its Subsidiaries and
Controlled Affiliates to comply with all of the provisions of this Section
6.16, to the extent applicable. Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnified Persons from and against any and all Losses
suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them arising out of or in connection
with the breach by any Subsidiaries or Controlled Affiliates of Purchaser.

  

  

Section 6.17 Pre-Closing Restructuring. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, prior to the consummation of the applicable Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to perform the actions set
forth in Exhibit M hereto (the "Pre-Closing Restructuring") with respect to
the Excluded Transferred Entity Assets and the Excluded TLM Assets held by TLM
Philippines. For the avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Closing Restructuring shall
be completed by Seller or its applicable Subsidiaries prior to the applicable
Closing Date.

Section 6.18 Bank Accounts. During the period following the date hereof until
the earlier of the applicable Closing Date and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to its terms, Seller shall, or cause its Subsidiaries to,
use its reasonable best efforts to amend all agreements or arrangements
governing each bank and brokerage account that is listed or described in
Section 6.18 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (each, a "HHI/TLM Bank
Account"), so that (a) such HHI/TLM Bank Accounts, if currently linked
(whether by automatic withdrawal, automatic deposit, or any other
authorization to transfer funds from or to, hereinafter "linked") to any bank
or brokerage account owned by Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than an
HHI/TLM Bank Account) (each, a "Seller Bank Account"), are de-linked from
Seller Bank Accounts as of, or promptly following, the applicable Closing, and
(b) the authorization of employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries, other than
those who will be employees of the Business after the applicable Closing, to
access or control such HHI/TLM Bank Accounts shall be terminated as of, or
promptly following, the applicable Closing, except to the extent necessary to
comply with this Section 6.18 promptly following the applicable Closing and
except as otherwise contemplated by the HHI Transition Services Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.19 Notification of Certain Matters. During the period following the
date hereof until the earlier of the Second Closing Date and the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, each of Seller and Purchaser shall
give prompt notice to the other party upon receiving Knowledge of (a) any
notices, complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating
that the same may be contemplated) of any Governmental Authorities with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary
Agreements, (b) any written notices or other written communications from any
third Persons alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary
Agreements, (c) the institution of any material Action involving Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries or Purchaser, or (d) any material event, development, or
occurrence (including any violation of Section 4.05(b)) that would reasonably
be expected to give rise to a failure of a condition precedent set forth in
Article IX.

applicable Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its

recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, equity investment or similar
transaction involving the Business, or any purchase of all or a substantial
portion of the assets of either the HHI Business or the TLM Business (a
"Proposal") with any Person other than Purchaser; (ii) other than informing
Persons of the existence of this Section 6.20 or communicating that such
Person is not permitted to engage in such activity at such time, engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any information or data concerning the
Business to, or have any discussions with, any Person other than Purchaser
that has made a Proposal; or (iii) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or
assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by
any Person other than Purchaser to do or seek any of the foregoing.

  

  

(b) Seller shall notify Purchaser orally and in writing promptly (but in any
event no later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by Seller, its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives of any
Proposal from any Person other than Purchaser or any request for non-public
information relating to the Business. Such notice shall indicate the identity
of the Person making the Proposal, or intending to make a Proposal or
requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of the
Business, the material terms of any such Proposal, or modification or
amendment to such Proposal and copies of any written Proposals or amendments
and supplements thereto. Seller shall keep Purchaser informed, on a current
basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes or
modifications in the material terms of any such Proposal or request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be required to take any action
that would violate any existing confidentiality agreement.

  

  

(c) Seller shall, and shall direct its Affiliates and Subsidiaries, and each
of their respective Representatives to, immediately terminate all discussions
or negotiations with all Persons other than Purchaser who have made Proposals
that are currently ongoing and shall promptly request the prompt return or
destruction of any confidential information provided to (and terminate the VDR

Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller shall not be deemed to have made
any representations or warranties with respect to such financial statements,
except that such financial statements will be prepared in good faith and in
all material respects in accordance with the books of account and records of
the HHI Business. Purchaser shall, promptly upon the written request of
Seller, reimburse Seller and its Subsidiaries, without any right to set off or
counterclaim, for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs that have
been incurred by Seller and its Subsidiaries (including those of their
respective Representatives, but not including any allocated Seller overhead
charged to such Representatives) in connection with preparing such financial
statements and obtaining such audit opinions.

  

  

(c) Unless and until the Second Closing Provisions have been validly
terminated pursuant to Section 11.03, Seller shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
audited financial statements and corresponding unqualified audit opinions with

(d) To the extent not otherwise already provided and if requested by Purchaser
in writing prior to May 15, 2013, for the purposes of filing a registration
statement under the Securities Act, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its
subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to provide the Purchaser as
soon as reasonably practicable following such request financial statements

under the Securities Act together with other information with respect to the
Business necessary to prepare (and will reasonably cooperate with Purchaser's
preparation of) pro forma financial statements required to be included
therein; and will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, if so required
under the Securities Act, an unqualified audit opinion from Ernst and Young LLP
with respect to such financial statements and such firm\'s consent to the
filing of such report. Purchaser shall, promptly upon the written request of
Seller, reimburse Seller and its Subsidiaries, without any right to set off or
counterclaim, for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs that have
been incurred by Seller and its Subsidiaries (including those of their

definitive supply agreement and a definitive transition services agreement, in
each case containing the terms set forth in Exhibit H and otherwise on terms
substantially similar to, in the case of such definitive supply agreement, the
HHI Supply Agreement and, in the case of such definitive transition services
agreement, the HHI Transition Services Agreement.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Second Closing, the parties shall jointly prepare (i) a
detailed separation plan and (ii) joint operating budget for the TLM Business

parties from and after the Second Closing and until three (3) years from the
Second Closing Date unless amended, modified, replaced or supplemented from
time to time by mutual agreement of the parties after the Second Closing Date
(the "TLM Separation Plan"); provided, however, if the parties fail to prepare
or otherwise agree on the TLM Separation Plan by the time the Second Closing
is to occur pursuant to Section 2.06(b), Exhibit O shall constitute the TLM
Separation Plan for all purposes hereunder.

respect of Employees on military leave who are listed on Section 7.01(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Leave Employees" and, together with the
Current Employees, the "Closing Date Employees"). Purchaser is not required to
offer employment to any Listed Employee, but if it elects to offer employment,
it must do so in accordance with the terms set forth in this Article VII. All
such offers of employment to (i) each Current Employee shall provide for
employment with Purchaser or an applicable Affiliate of Purchaser to commence
effective as of 11:59 P.M., local time, on the applicable Closing Date and
(ii) each Leave Employee shall provide for employment with Purchaser or an
applicable Affiliate of Purchaser to commence at the expiration of such Leave
Employee's leave or period of disability. All such offers of employment shall
be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of this

Section 7.01. Each Closing Date Employee who accepts Purchaser's or one of its
Affiliate's offer of employment and whose employment with Purchaser or one of
its Affiliates commences as of the applicable Closing Date, or with respect to
a Leave Employee, upon the expiration of his leave of absence, together with
each HHI Employee or TLM Employee, as applicable, employed by a Transferred
Entity and each Closing Date Employee whose employment is transferred to
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser by operation of Law, shall be referred
to herein as a "Transferred Employee"; provided, that a Leave Employee shall
not be treated as a Transferred Employee until the expiration of the Leave
Employee's period of absence, and the date on which any such Transferred
Employee commences employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall be
referred to herein as the Transferred Employee's "Transfer Date." For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any Employee on a leave of absence from
employment become a Transferred Employee if such leave of absence extends
beyond one hundred eighty (180) days following the applicable Closing Date
other than employees on military leave who are listed on Section 7.01(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt, the Transfer Date
for all HHI Employees and Listed Employees other than Leave Employees shall be
the Closing Date. In the event that the employment of an HHI Employee or TLM
Employee transfers automatically to Purchaser or its Affiliate upon the
occurrence of the applicable Closing Date by operation of Law, Purchaser and
Seller agree to take, or cause their respective Affiliates to take, all
actions required under applicable Law and all other actions as are reasonably
necessary or appropriate such that the employment of such HHI Employee or TLM
Employee will transfer to Purchaser or its Affiliate automatically as of the
Transfer Date. A Current Employee who arrives at his then applicable place of
employment in the Business on the first Business Day immediately following the
applicable Closing Date shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to
have accepted Purchaser's or one of its Affiliate's offer of employment for
all purposes of this Agreement. Offers pursuant to this Section 7.01(a) shall
comply in all respects with such applicable Law (including with respect to
compensation and benefits) and may, if Seller reasonably requests, make
employment contingent upon the Transferred Employee's waiver of any and all
claims or right to severance in connection with the transfer of employment.

  

  

(b) With respect to each U.S. Transferred Employee, Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall provide such U.S. Transferred Employee with employment in a
position that is substantially comparable to such U.S. Transferred Employee's
position immediately prior to the applicable Closing Date and, for the one-
year period immediately following the applicable Closing Date, Purchaser or
its Affiliates shall provide to each U.S. Transferred Employee (A) cash bonus
opportunity and wage rates, as applicable, that are substantially comparable
to those provided to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the
applicable Closing Date and (B) employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided by Seller and its
Affiliates immediately prior to the applicable Closing Date, without regard,
in each case of (A) and (B), to equity-based compensation, defined benefit
pension benefits, or post-termination health and welfare benefits.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contemplated by this Agreement shall be
construed as requiring either Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to be
obligated to continue the employment of any U.S. Transferred Employee for any
period after the applicable Transfer Date

  

  

(c) With respect to each U.S. Transferred Employee whose employment terminates
during the one-year period immediately following the applicable Closing Date,
Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the better of (i) those severance or termination benefits
applicable to such Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the
applicable Closing Date under a Benefit Plan disclosed and made available to
Purchaser as of the date hereof in accordance with Section 4.09(a), and (ii)
those provided under Purchaser's severance plan, program, policy or practice
(whether contractual or otherwise) applicable to such Transferred Employee on
the date of such U.S. Transferred Employee's termination. For the avoidance of
doubt, if during such one-year period, a Transferred Employee's employment
should terminate as a result of his or her desire not to accept a relocation
that would result in a commute of more than fifty (50) miles from his or her
office immediately prior to the applicable Closing Date, then Purchaser will
be obligated to pay such Transferred Employee severance as described in the
immediately preceding sentence.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

100  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(d) With respect to each U.S. Transferred Employee, effective from and after
the applicable Transfer Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall (i) recognize
for all purposes (other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension
plan or retiree medical plan) under all plans, programs and arrangements
established or maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates for the benefit of
the U.S. Transferred Employees, service with Seller and its Affiliates through
the applicable Transfer Date to the extent that such service was recognized
under the corresponding HHI Benefit Plan or TLM Benefit Plan covering such
U.S. Transferred Employees, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit levels and accruals, (ii) with respect to self-insured Purchaser
Benefit Plans, waive, and with respect to insured Purchaser Benefit Plans, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable third-party insurer to
waive, any pre-existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or
waiting period under all employee health and other welfare benefit plans
established or maintained by Seller or its Affiliates for the benefit of the
Transferred Employees, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition,
exclusion, requirement or waiting period would have applied to such individual
under the corresponding HHI Benefit Plan or TLM Benefit Plan and (iii) with
respect to self-insured Purchaser Benefit Plans, provide, or with respect to
insured Purchaser Benefit Plans, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the applicable third-party insurer to provide, full credit for any co-
payments, deductibles or similar payments made or incurred on or prior to the
applicable Closing Date for the plan year in which the applicable Closing
occurs.

  

  

(e) Seller and Purchaser intend that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement should not constitute a separation, termination or severance of
employment of any Transferred Employee prior to or upon the occurrence of the
Transfer Date, including for purposes of any HHI Benefit Plan, Listed Employee
Benefit Plan or TLM Benefit Plan that provides for separation, termination or
severance benefits or that requires an Employee to repay his employer any
amounts, including sign-on bonuses, tuition reimbursements and housing
differential payments, upon a termination of employment, and that each such
Transferred Employee will have continuous and uninterrupted employment
immediately before and immediately after the Transfer Date, and Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, comply with
any requirements under applicable Law to ensure the same. Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall bear all of the liabilities, obligations and costs relating
to any claims made by any Employee for any statutory, common law, contractual
(to the extent made pursuant to an HHI Benefit Plan, Listed Employee Benefit
Plan, TLM Benefit Plan, or other arrangement permitted by Section 6.01(b)(x)),
and any other legally mandated payment obligations (including any compensation
payable during a mandatory termination notice period and any payments pursuant
to a Judgment of a court having jurisdiction over the parties hereto but
specifically excluding any claims for benefits or pension benefits under HHI
Benefit Plans, Listed Employee Benefit Plan or TLM Benefit Plans with respect
to service prior to the applicable Closing Date with Seller and its
Affiliates) and for any other claim, cost, liability or obligation (whether
related to compensation, benefits or otherwise), in each case, arising solely
out of or in connection with the failure of Purchaser or its Affiliates to
make an offer of employment to or continue the employment of any Employee in
accordance with, and to the extent mandated by, the terms of this Agreement or
any other individual who is entitled to transfer automatically to Purchaser or
its Affiliates upon the occurrence of the applicable Closing by operation of
Law, in each case, in accordance with this Agreement or Applicable Law.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (including Section 6.06),
Seller shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to be, responsible, either
directly or through insurance policies maintained by Seller or its Affiliates,
for all covered medical, vision, dental, prescription drug and other welfare
plan expenses incurred, and claims for disability income benefits made, by any
Transferred Employee or his or her dependents, on or prior to the Transfer
Date. Purchaser shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to be, responsible for
all covered medical, vision, dental, prescription drug and other welfare plan
expenses incurred, and claims for disability income benefits made, by any
Transferred Employee or his or her dependents after the Transfer Date. Except
in the event of any claim for workers compensation benefits, for purposes of
this Agreement, the following claims and liabilities shall be deemed to be
incurred as follows: (1) medical, vision, dental and/or prescription drug
benefits (including hospital expenses), upon provision of the services,
materials or supplies constituting any such benefits and (2) short- and long-
term disability, life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel
accident insurance benefits, upon the death, illness, injury or accident
giving rise to such benefits. Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible
for all claims for workers compensation benefits that are incurred either (i)
prior to the Transfer Date by any Transferred Employee or (ii) on, prior to,
or following the relevant Closing Date by any Employee who does not become a
Transferred Employee. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be responsible for
all claims for workers compensation benefits that are incurred on or after the
Transfer Date by any Transferred Employee. A claim for workers compensation
benefits shall be deemed incurred when the event giving rise to the claim
occurs.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

101  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 7.01 to the contrary,
(i) with respect to each Non-U.S. Transferred Employee, (A) Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall provide such Non-U.S. Transferred Employee with employment in
a position that is substantially comparable to such Non-U.S. Transferred
Employee's position immediately prior to the applicable Closing Date, (B)
effective from and after the applicable Transfer Date, Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall provide to such Non-U.S. Transferred Employee each term and
condition of employment (including seniority and other service credit) and
each type and amount of compensation and benefits required by applicable Law
in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction (whether as an absolute requirement or
as a condition to avoiding any penalty, liability, obligation or expense) and
(C) for the one-year period immediately following the applicable Closing Date,
Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide to such Non-U.S. Transferred
Employee other terms and conditions of employment (including seniority and
other service credit) and types and amounts of compensation and benefits,
without regard to equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension benefits
or post-termination health and welfare benefits (excluding those items subject
to clause (B), above), that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided by Seller and its Affiliates, in each case, immediately prior
to the applicable Closing Date (provided that base salaries, cash bonus
opportunities and wage rates shall be substantially comparable to those
provided immediately prior to the applicable Closing Date), (ii) with respect
to Non-U.S. Transferred Employees covered by Labor Agreements, effective from
and after the Transfer Date, Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall comply
with applicable Law concerning Labor Agreements in the context of this
Agreement, and (iii) with respect to Transferred Employees located in Canada
or Taiwan, Purchaser shall take the actions or provide the benefits listed on
Section 7.01(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, as applicable.

  

  

(h) If any Employee requires a work permit, employment pass, visa or other
legal or regulatory approval for his or her employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliates, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such permit, pass, visa or other
approval to be obtained and in effect prior to the Transfer Date, and Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all reasonably necessary or
appropriate action at Purchaser's expense, as reasonably requested by
Purchaser, to assist in obtaining any such permit, pass, visa or other
approval prior to the Transfer Date.

  

  

(i) As of the Transfer Date, Seller shall provide to Purchaser and its
Affiliates all employment records for each Transferred Employee required to be
provided to Purchaser and its Affiliates under applicable Law and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide all employment records for any
other Transferred Employee as reasonably requested by Purchaser the transfer
of which is not prohibited by applicable Law or subject to such Transferred
Employee's consent. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall ensure that all such
records are used only in connection with the employment of such Transferred
Employee and shall keep such employment records confidential to the extent
required under applicable Law.

  

  

(j) Unless otherwise required by Law, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
relevant Affiliate to, grant each Transferred Employee paid time off in an
amount equal to such Transferred Employee's accrued and unused vacation hours,
as set forth for such Transferred Employee in Section 7.01(j) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, as such amount shall be updated by Seller immediately
prior to the applicable Transfer Date. If such Transferred Employee terminates
employment with Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser prior to using such
paid time off, Purchaser shall pay such Closing Date Employee an amount equal
to compensation for any such paid time off upon such employment termination.
If accrued and unused vacation hours are not permitted by Law to be carried
over to Purchaser as described in this Section 7.01(j), immediately prior to
the applicable Transfer Date, Seller shall pay to each Transferred Employee
the amount of compensation with respect to the accrued and unused vacation
hours that is due and owing to such Transferred Employee as of immediately
prior to the applicable Transfer Date, as set forth for such Transferred
Employee in Section 7.01(j) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and as updated
by Seller immediately prior to the applicable Transfer Date.

  

  

(k) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with Purchaser
and its applicable Affiliates in respect of Purchaser's efforts to hire at the
relevant Closing Date the Current Employees and to retain at the relevant
Closing Date the Transferred Employees and shall take no actions to cause any
individual who would be as of the date hereof a Closing Date Employee or
Transferred Employee to be transferred to any business or function of Seller
or any of its Affiliates other than the Business. Prior to the applicable
Transfer Date, Purchaser may not communicate directly with any Employees until
Seller has first been afforded a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on any proposed communications. Seller (or any of its Affiliates) shall
neither communicate directly with any Employees regarding the terms and
conditions of their employment with Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates) nor
make or deliver any formal written communications or oral representations to
any Employees regarding Purchaser or its Affiliates, Purchaser's offers of
employment or such Employees' transfers of employment, or any other
compensation or personal matters relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in either case, until Purchaser has first been afforded a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such proposed
communications.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

102  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(l) As of the applicable Transfer Date, Purchaser shall have created an
account under Purchaser's FSA Plan for each Transferred Employee who, as of
immediately prior to the Transfer Date, maintained a balance under Seller's
FSA Plan, and shall credit such account with an amount equal to such balance;
provided, that to the extent that the FSA accounts are not reflected on the
Closing Statement and notwithstanding anything in Section 2.04 or Section 2.05
to the contrary, then either (i) Seller shall transfer to Purchaser within
sixty (60) days after the Transfer Date a cash payment equal to the excess, if
any, of the aggregate amount withheld from the Transferred Employee's
compensation under Seller's FSA Plan for the plan year in which the Transfer
Date occurs over the aggregate amount reimbursed to the Transferred Employee
under Seller's FSA Plan for such plan year, or (ii) Purchaser shall transfer
to Seller within sixty (60) days after the Transfer Date a cash payment equal
to the excess, if any, of the aggregate amount reimbursed to the Transferred
Employee under Seller's FSA Plan for the plan year in which the Transfer Date
occurs over the aggregate amount withheld from the Transferred Employee's
compensation under Seller's FSA Plan for such year. For purposes of this
Section 7.01(l), the term "FSA Plan" shall mean a flexible spending account
plan for medical and dependent care expenses maintained under Section 125 and
Section 129 of the Code. For purposes of clarification, nothing herein shall
require Seller to establish an FSA Plan or FSA Plan account for any Employee
in any year, and if no such FSA Plan or FSA Plan account exists, this Section
7.01(l) shall have no effect.

  

  

(m) If applicable, Seller shall take all action necessary under the applicable
HHI Benefit Plan, Listed Employee Benefit Plan or TLM Benefit Plan to permit
each Transferred Employee who maintains a health savings account thereunder to
roll over to Purchaser's health savings account program in a direct trust-to-
trust transfer, at the election of such Transferred Employee, the balance in
such account, provided that Purchaser shall pay all administrative costs in
connection with such trust-to-trust transfer.

  

  

(n) Seller shall take all action necessary under each applicable tax-qualified
defined contribution plan in the U.S. of Seller and its Affiliates ("Seller's
Savings Plan") to permit each Transferred Employee who is a participant in
such Seller's Savings Plan to have any portion of an "eligible rollover
distribution" (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) transferred in a
"direct rollover" (as defined in A-3 of Treasury Regulation § 1.401(a)(31)-1)
to a tax-qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. maintained by
Purchaser ("Purchaser's Savings Plan"), to the extent that such Transferred
Employee is then a participant in Purchaser's Savings Plan, including a
"direct rollover" of any note evidencing a participant loan under Seller's
Savings Plan. Any rollover contemplated by this Section 7.01(n) shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchaser's Savings Plan. In
addition, effective as of the applicable Transfer Date, Seller shall adopt an
amendment to Seller's Savings Plan pursuant to which the account of each
Transferred Employee shall be fully vested and nonforfeitable.

  

  

(o) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent that any
Transferred Employee has received any sign-on bonus, tuition reimbursement
payment, or housing differential payment prior to the applicable Transfer Date
that, pursuant to the terms of the applicable HHI Benefit Plan, TLM Benefit
Plan, or Listed Employee Benefit Plan and but for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, would have been required to be repaid to
Seller or its Subsidiaries due to such Transferred Employee's termination of
employment following the applicable Transfer Date, then upon such Transferred
Employee's termination such repayment shall be made to Purchaser or its
designated Subsidiary, and neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
have any rights, title, or interest in such repayment.

  

  

Section 7.02 Assumption of Assumed Benefit Plans; Transfer of Related Assets.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, effective as
of the relevant Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates
to, assume all of the rights, title, interests, obligations and liabilities
under each of the Assumed Benefit Plans; provided, that in respect of the
Kwikset Employees Trust (the "Trust"), Seller will use commercially reasonable
efforts between the date hereof and the First Closing to cause the trustees of
the Trust to take steps reasonably necessary to permit the employees of
Kwikset and its successors who become Transferred Employees to be able to
continue as beneficiaries of the Trust after the First Closing, and to
transfer to Purchaser any sponsorship, control, or other interest that Seller
may have in, and any obligations that Seller may have with respect to, the
Trust.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

103  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(b) Effective as of the relevant Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause
one if its Affiliates to, assume sponsorship of, and shall succeed to all of
the rights, title and interest (including the rights of Seller or any of its
Affiliates, as applicable, if any, as plan sponsor, plan administrator or
employer) under, each Assumed Benefit Plan, including, as provided in Section
7.02(a) in respect of the Trust. The parties hereto shall use their reasonable
commercial efforts to cooperate with each other, and shall cause their
officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives to cooperate with
each other after the relevant Closing Date in the execution of any documents,
adoption of any corporate resolutions or the taking of all actions that are
necessary and appropriate to effectuate such sponsorship and related transfers
of Assumed Benefit Plans and related assets.

  

  

Section 7.03 Liability for Employees.

  

  

(a) Effective from and after the applicable Transfer Date, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, be responsible for any and all Liabilities
or obligations (i) arising under or with respect to any Purchaser Benefit
Plan, (ii) with respect to any Transferred Employee to the extent accrued or
incurred on or after the Transfer Date and attributable to events or
circumstances occurring or arising on or after the Transfer Date (other than
any such liability or obligation arising under any HHI Benefit Plan, Listed
Employee Benefit Plan, TLM Benefit Plan, or Deferred Transfer Employee Benefit
Plan other than an Assumed Benefit Plan), (iii) arising under or with respect
to any Assumed Benefit Plan, (iv) with respect to any Employee or Former
Employee employed or formerly employed by any Transferred Entity except, in
the case of this clause (iv) only, for (A) Liabilities expressly retained by
Seller under any HHI Benefit Plan, Listed Employee Benefit Plan, TLM Benefit
Plan or Deferred Transfer Employee Benefit Plan, including Liabilities
retained by Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to Section 7.01(f), or (B)
Liabilities with respect to any Former Employee in respect of any period of
employment with Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller other than a Transferred
Entity, and (v) that transfer by operation of law.

  

  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 7.01(e), Section 7.01(f) and Section
7.03(a), effective from and after the applicable Closing Date, Seller shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, remain responsible for any and all
Liabilities or obligations arising under or with respect to (i) any HHI
Benefit Plan, Listed Employee Benefit Plan, TLM Benefit Plan or Deferred
Transfer Employee Benefit Plan (other than an Assumed Benefit Plan), (ii) any
liability or obligation of Seller or any entity that together with Seller
could be treated as a single employer under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section
414 of the Code in respect of, any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, (iii) any Transferred Employee not employed by a
Transferred Entity as of the applicable Closing Date to the extent accrued
prior to the Transfer Date and attributable to events or circumstances
occurring or arising prior to the applicable Transfer Date, (iv) Former
Employees or Employees who do not become Transferred Employees, other than any
Liability under any Assumed Benefit Plan, (v) any defined benefit pension plan
or retiree medical plan with respect to any Listed Employee, Deferred Transfer
Employee or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, to the extent accrued as of
the applicable Closing Date, and (vi) the retention bonuses under the MICP.

  

  

Section 7.04 U.S. Tax Matters. The parties hereto agree to (i) treat Purchaser
and its Affiliates as a "successor employer" and Seller and its Subsidiaries
as a "predecessor" within the meaning of Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of
the Code with respect to Transferred Employees for purposes of taxes imposed
under the United States Federal Unemployment Tax Act and the United States
Federal Insurance Contributions Act and (ii) use their reasonable best efforts
to cooperate with each other to avoid the filing of more than one IRS Form W-2
with respect to each Transferred Employee for the calendar year(s) in which
the relevant Transfer Date occurs in accordance with Revenue Procedure
2004-53.

  

  

Section 7.05 No Employee Rights. Nothing in this Article VII, express or
implied, shall confer upon any Employee, or legal representative or
beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment
or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits
of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this Article
VII, expressed or implied, shall be construed to prevent Purchaser from
terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any Purchaser Benefit
Plan. Nothing in this Article VII, expressed or implied, or any other
provision of this Agreement shall amend, or be deemed to amend, any Benefit
Plan (including any HHI Benefit Plan, Listed Employee Benefit Plan, TLM
Benefit Plan, Deferred Transfer Employee Benefit Plan, or Purchaser Benefit
Plan), and nothing in this Article VII, express or implied, or any other
provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does, constitute the
establishment of, or an amendment to, any Benefit Plan (including any HHI
Benefit Plan, Listed Employee Benefit Plan, TLM Benefit Plan, Deferred
Transfer Employee Benefit Plan, or Purchaser Benefit Plan).

  

  

Section 7.06 Listed Employees. Seller shall update Sections 4.09 and 4.10 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule with respect to the Listed Employees, as soon
as practicable, and in any event, not more than sixty (60) days after the date

104  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Section 7.07 Deferred Transfer Employee. On or prior to the Second Closing
Date, Seller shall identify the Deferred Transfer Employees on Section 7.07 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules and Section 1.01(m) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules, and Seller shall update Sections 4.09 and 4.10 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules with respect to the Deferred Transfer Employees and
Deferred Transfer Employee Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Article VII,
the Transfer Date for each Deferred Transfer Employee who is listed on Section
7.07 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules and not listed on Section 1.01(m) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules shall be the date on which his employment
transfers to Purchaser or its Affiliate pursuant to the terms of the TLM
Transition Services Agreement, and the terms and conditions governing the
hiring and transfer of any such Deferred Transfer Employees shall be set forth
in the TLM Transition Services Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

  

TAX MATTERS

  

  

Section 8.01 Transfer Taxes. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear one-half of
the costs of all Transfer Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority,
regardless of the Person on whom such Taxes are imposed, resulting from this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser shall be
responsible for the timely filing of any Tax Return relating to Transfer
Taxes, except to the extent that Seller is responsible for the filing of any
such Tax Return under applicable Law. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser and, subject to the other terms of this Agreement, shall take any
action reasonably requested by Purchaser that does not cause Seller to incur
any cost or material inconvenience in order to minimize Transfer Taxes.

  

  

Section 8.02 Tax Characterization of Adjustments. Seller and Purchaser agree
to treat all payments made either to or for the benefit of the other following
the respective Closings (including any payments made under any indemnity
provisions of this Agreement and payments made pursuant to Section 2.12) as
adjustments to the HHI Purchase Price or the TLM Purchase Price, as
applicable, for all Tax purposes, and that such treatment shall govern for
purposes hereof, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

  

  

Section 8.03 Real Estate and Property Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements, any real estate Tax, personal property and
intangible property Taxes ("Property Taxes") or similar ad valorem obligations
with respect to the Transferred Assets applicable to periods beginning before
the applicable Closing Date, and ending after the applicable Closing Date
("Apportioned Obligations") shall be allocated between Seller and Purchaser
pro rata based on the number of days that occur on or before the applicable
Closing Date, on the one hand, and after the applicable Closing Date, on the
other hand. Each party hereto shall cooperate in assuring that, to the extent
practicable, Apportioned Obligations the payment of which is due on or prior
to the applicable Closing Date are billed directly to and paid by Seller, and
that Apportioned Obligations whose payment is due after the applicable Closing
Date are billed directly to and paid by Purchaser. On the applicable Closing
Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser any bill received by it prior to the
applicable Closing Date in respect of any Apportioned Obligations not yet due
and payable and Seller and Purchaser shall each present or cause to be
presented a statement to the other setting forth the amount of reimbursement
to which each is entitled under this Section 8.03 (together with such
supporting evidence as may be reasonably requested), and they shall calculate
the amount by which such reimbursement owed to one party exceeds that owed to
the other (the "Proration Amount"), and on such date the Proration Amount so
determined shall be paid by the party owing it to the other. In the event that
any party shall thereafter make a payment for which it is entitled to
reimbursement under this Section 8.03, the party so obligated to make such
reimbursement under this Section 8.03 shall make such reimbursement promptly
upon the presentation of such supporting evidence as may be reasonably
requested. In the event that any refund, rebate or similar payment is received
by Purchaser or Seller for any Property Taxes or similar ad valorem
obligations which are Apportioned Obligations, the parties hereto agree that
such payment will be apportioned between Seller and Purchaser on the basis of
their respective ownership of the taxed Assets during the assessment period.
In the event that it is determined subsequent to the applicable Closing Date
that any additional Property Taxes or similar ad valorem obligations which are
Apportioned Obligations are required to be paid, the parties hereto agree that
such additional taxes will be apportioned between Seller and Purchaser on the
basis of their respective ownership of the taxed Assets during the assessment
period.

Section 8.04 Tax Returns.

  

  

(a) For any taxable period of the Transferred Entities that includes (but does
not end on) the First Closing Date or, in the case of TLM Philippines, the
Second Closing Date, Purchaser shall timely prepare (or cause to be prepared)
and file all Tax Returns required to be filed on a basis consistent with past
practices of the Business, except as otherwise required by Law, and shall pay
(or cause to be paid) all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller, for its review and comment no less than

Return to the Seller, so long as such comment is not manifestly unreasonable.
To the extent Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 12.07 for any amount
of Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns, Seller shall pay Purchaser such
amount at least five (5) days before such Tax Return is due.

  

  

(b) For any taxable period of the Transferred Entities that ends on or before

attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than any such refund or credit
resulting from the carryback of losses, credits or similar items of a
Transferred Entity, as the case may be, from a Post-Closing Tax Period) shall
be for the account of Seller. Purchaser shall forward, and shall cause its
Affiliates to forward, to Seller the amount of the Tax Asset within ten (10)
days after such Tax Asset is received or after such Tax Asset is allowed or
applied against another Tax liability, as the case may be. Except as provided
in this Section 8.04(c), Purchaser and the Transferred Entities will be
entitled to any refunds (including any interest received thereon) in respect
of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax liability of the Transferred

extraordinary transactions (other than any such transactions expressly
required by applicable Law or by this Agreement) that could result in Tax
liability to any Transferred Entity in excess of Tax liability associated with
the conduct of its business in the ordinary course.

or otherwise, and no Seller Related Party shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection

(e) (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except for
the right of Seller to seek an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief pursuant to, and only to the extent expressly permitted by,
Section 13.13, Seller's sole and exclusive remedy against Purchaser in respect
of the failure of the First Closing to be consummated pursuant to this
Agreement, any Contract executed in connection herewith, and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise), shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
this Article XI and collect, if due, the Purchaser Termination Fee or
Financing Termination Fee pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of Section 11.02(b) and the amounts as provided in the last two
sentences of Section 6.04(a), the last two sentences of Section 6.15(e) and
the last sentence of Section 11.02(e)(i). The parties acknowledge and agree
that any payment of the HHI Purchaser Termination Fee or Financing Termination
Fee pursuant to Section 11.02(b) is not a penalty but is liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Seller in the circumstances in which
such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and the
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision; accordingly, if Purchaser fails to promptly pay the HHI
Purchaser Termination Fee or Financing Termination Fee when due, and in order
to obtain such payment, Seller commences an Action that results in a judgment
against Purchaser for the HHI Purchaser Termination Fee or Financing
Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) of Seller in connection with such Action, together with
interest on the amount of such HHI Purchaser Termination Fee or Financing
Termination Fee or portion thereof at the prime rate as published by Reuters,
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment.

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except for
the right of Purchaser to seek an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief pursuant to, and only to the extent expressly permitted by,
Section 13.13, Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy against Seller in respect
of the failure of the First Closing to be consummated pursuant to this
Agreement, any Contract executed in connection herewith, and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise), shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
this Article XI and collect, if due, the HHI Seller Termination Fee pursuant
to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 11.02(c) and the
amounts as provided in the last two sentences of Section 6.04(a) and the last
sentence of Section 11.02(e)(ii). The parties acknowledge and agree that any
payment of the HHI Seller Termination Fee pursuant to Section 11.02(c) is not
a penalty but is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Purchaser in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while

if Seller fails to promptly pay the HHI Seller Termination Fee when due, and
in order to obtain such payment, Purchaser commences an Action that results in
a judgment against Seller for the HHI Seller Termination Fee or any portion
thereof, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) of Purchaser in
connection with such Action, together with interest on the amount of such HHI
Seller Termination Fee or portion thereof at the prime rate as published by

by the Termination Date or (B) if capable of being cured, such breach or
failure shall not have been cured within the earlier of (x) thirty (30)
Business Days following receipt of written notice (which notice shall specify

(iii) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 12.01(a)(i)
(other than with respect to a breach of the representations and warranties
contained in Section 4.23) unless the aggregate of all Losses for which
Seller, but for this clause (iii), would be liable under Section 12.01(a)(i)
(other than with respect to a breach of the representations and warranties
contained in Section 4.23) exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to
Fourteen Million Dollars ($14,000,000) (the "Deductible") and then only to the
extent of the excess of such Losses over Twelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000);

  

  

(iv) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 12.01(a)(i)
(other than with respect to a breach of the representations and warranties
contained in Section 4.23) and (iii) (other than with respect to a breach of
the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.02(e), Section
4.14(i) and Section 4.24) for any claim where the Losses relating thereto are
less than $50,000 (it being understood that any series of related claims shall
be aggregated for purposes of this clause (iv) and the immediately preceding
clause (iii));

  

  

(v) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 12.01(a)(i),
Section 12.01(a)(iii) or Section 12.01(a)(xii) for any amount that when
aggregated with all other amounts payable as a result of indemnification under
Section 12.01(a)(i), Section 12.01(a)(iii) or, after giving effect to the
limitation set forth in Section 12.01(b)(x), Section 12.01(a)(xii) (but for
the application of this Section 12.01(b)(v)) would be in excess of One-Hundred
Forty Million Dollars ($140,000,000) (the "Cap");

  

  

(vi) For purposes of Section 12.01(a), all Losses shall be (x) reduced by (A)
the amount of any insurance proceeds actually paid to Purchaser or any
Purchaser Indemnified Person with respect to such Loss pursuant to Section
6.06(c) or under any Transferred Policy (less the costs associated with
recovery of such proceeds and any increase in insurance premiums under such
Transferred Policy), (B) any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
actually paid to Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person by any third
party with respect to such Loss, and (C) an amount equal to any net reduction
of income Taxes of Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person attributable
to a Tax benefit actually realized in the year of such Loss as a direct result
of such Loss, and (y) increased by any additional Tax costs actually incurred
in the year of the receipt of an indemnification payment hereunder with
respect to such Loss as a result of the receipt of such payment;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

120  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(vii) The obligation to indemnify under Section 12.01(a)(iii) with respect to
any breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.11 or
under Section 12.01(a)(v) with respect to Retained Environmental Liabilities
(each, an "Environmental Claim"), to the extent such Liabilities relate to the
Real Property, shall be limited to the lowest cost alternative reasonably
available to allow either (A) continued operation of the Real Property in
substantially the same manner it was operated at the applicable Closing on the
basis of the minimum reasonably required to comply with any settlement or
resolution with any Governmental Authority and applicable Environmental Laws
and does not interfere with such operations at the Real Property, or (B)
closure or termination of operations at the Real Property in compliance with
applicable Environmental Laws (it being understood that closure or termination
of operations does not include any disturbance of the applicable Real Property
except to the extent required by applicable Law as a result of such closure or
termination of operations). Taking no action shall constitute an acceptable
lowest cost alternative if, after investigation, taking no action is
determined to be in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws and such
inaction is not prohibited by relevant Governmental Authorities.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons shall not be entitled to claim or seek indemnity with respect to any
Environmental Claim under this Agreement to the extent that such Environmental
Claim arises out of any development, modification or change of use of any of
the Real Property after the applicable Closing to a use other than the
continued operation of the Business or the continuation of the activities
necessary to support the Business as it was conducted prior to the applicable
Closing, where such development, modification or change results in the
application of stricter cleanup standards pursuant to Environmental Laws;
provided, however, that closure or termination of operations at a Real
Property shall not constitute such a development, modification or change in
use (it being understood that closure or termination of operations does not
include any disturbance of the applicable Real Property except to the extent
required by applicable Law as a result of such closure or termination of
operations);

  

  

(viii) With respect to indemnification under Section 12.01(a)(v) with respect
to subsections (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of the definition of "Retained
Environmental Liabilities," such obligation to indemnify shall terminate on
the date that is the tenth anniversary of the Applicable Closing Date, unless
before such date a Purchaser Indemnified Person has provided Seller with an
applicable Claim Notice;

  

  

(ix) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 12.01(a)(iii)
with respect to any breach of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 4.11 or Section 12.01(a)(v) for any Losses to the extent such Losses
are triggered by any invasive environmental sampling at the Real Property by
or on behalf of Purchaser or its Affiliates unless such sampling is both (A)
in compliance with all applicable lease agreements and (B) conducted for
purposes of (1) legitimate business purposes separate from uncovering Current
Environmental Noncompliance or Current Site Contamination or (2) complying
with, or preventing a violation of, a requirement of applicable Environmental
Law; and

  

  

(x) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 12.01(a)(xii) for
any amount that when aggregated with all other amounts payable as a result of
indemnification under Section 12.01(a)(xii) (but for the application of this
Section 12.01(b)(x)) would be in excess of Nine Million Six Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($9,600,000).

  

  

(c) From and after the First Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, partners, members, agents and
representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Persons") from and
against any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them
(without duplication for any indemnification that may be sought under more
than one clause of this Section 12.01(c)) that result from, relate to or arise
out of:

  

  

(i) any breach of any of Purchaser's representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement (other than the Purchaser Fundamental Representations) or
such corresponding representations and warranties contained in any certificate
delivered by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, as of the
date hereof or as of the First Closing Date;

  

  

(ii) any breach of any of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations or such
corresponding representations and warranties contained in any certificate
delivered by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, as of the
date hereof or as of the First Closing Date;

  

  

(iii) any breach of any of Purchaser's agreements, obligations or covenants
contained in this Agreement; and

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

121  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(iv) the operation of the HHI Business from and after the First Closing, the
operation of the TLM Business from after the Second Closing or the Assumed
Liabilities (except to the extent a Purchaser Indemnified Person is entitled
to indemnification under Section 12.01(a) for such matter, disregarding for
such purposes the limitations contained in Section 12.01(b)).

  

  

provided that all matters relating to Taxes shall be governed exclusively by
Section 12.07.

  

  

(d) Purchaser's indemnification obligation under Section 12.01(c) shall be
subject to each of the following limitations:

  

  

(i) (A) With respect to indemnification under Section 12.01(c)(i), such
obligation to indemnify shall survive the First Closing and remain in full
force and effect until the date that is eighteen (18) months from the First
Closing Date; and (B) with respect to indemnification under Section
12.01(c)(ii), 12.01(c)(iv) and 12.01(c)(v) such obligation to indemnify shall
survive the First Closing and remain in full force and effect indefinitely;

  

  

(ii) With respect to indemnification under Section 12.01(c)(iii), such
obligation to indemnify shall, (A) with respect to the underlying agreements,
obligations and covenants of Purchaser that require performance on or prior to
the applicable Closing, shall survive the applicable Closing and remain in
full force and effect until the date that is eighteen (18) months from the
applicable Closing Date, and (B) with respect to the underlying agreements,
obligations and covenants of Purchaser that require performance from and after
the applicable Closing, shall survive the applicable Closing and remain in
full force and effect in accordance with the terms of such underlying
agreements, obligations and covenants of Purchaser;

  

  

(iii) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 12.01(c)(i)
unless the aggregate of all Losses for which Purchaser, but for this clause
(iii), would be liable under Section 12.01(c)(i) exceeds on a cumulative basis
the Deductible and then only to the extent of such excess;

  

  

(iv) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 12.01(c)(i) for
any claim where the Losses relating thereto are less than $50,000 (it being
understood that any series of related claims shall be aggregated for purposes
of this clause (iv) and the immediately preceding clause (iii));

  

  

(v) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 12.01(c)(i) for
any amount that when aggregated with all other amounts payable as a result of
indemnification under Section 12.01(c)(i) (but for the application of this
Section 12.01(d)(v)) would be in excess of the Cap; and

  

  

(vi) For purposes of Section 12.01(c) all Losses shall be (x) reduced by (A)
the amount of any insurance proceeds actually paid to Seller or any Seller
Indemnified Person with respect to such Loss, less the costs associated with
recovering such proceeds and any increases in insurance premiums, (B) any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually paid to Seller or
any Seller Indemnified Person by any third party with respect to such Loss,
and (C) an amount equal to any net reduction of income Taxes of Seller or any
Seller Indemnified Person attributable to a Tax benefit actually realized in
the year of such Loss as a direct result of such Loss, and (y) increased by
any additional Tax costs actually incurred in the year of the receipt of an
indemnification payment hereunder with respect to such Loss as a result of the
receipt of such payment.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

122  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 12.01, if a
claim for indemnification is properly asserted pursuant to this Article XII
prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in Section
12.01, then the applicable representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
relating to such indemnification claim and the applicable party's
indemnification obligations with respect thereto shall survive until, but only
for the purpose of, the final resolution thereof. For purposes of this Article
XII, all qualifiers or exceptions as to "materiality," "Material Adverse
Effect," dollar thresholds or other similar qualifications set forth in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement (other than the last sentence of Section
4.02(a) (Financial Statements), Section 4.03(b) (No Undisclosed Liabilities;
Absence of Certain Changes or Events) and the first sentence of Section 4.06
(Governmental Licenses and Permits) and the word "Material" in the term
"Material Contracts" and the categories of "Material Contracts" in Section
4.12) shall be disregarded both for purposes of (i) determining the existence
or occurrence of a breach pursuant to Section 12.01(a) or Section 12.01(c) and
(ii) determining the amount of Losses arising out of or resulting therefrom.

  

  

Section 12.02 Notice of Claim; Defense.

  

  

(a) If (i) any third party or Governmental Authority institutes, threatens or
asserts any action that may give rise to Losses for which a party (an
"Indemnifying Party") may be liable for indemnification under this Article XII
(a "Third-Party Claim") or (ii) any Person entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") shall have a claim to be indemnified
by an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct
Claim"), then, in case of clause (i) or (ii), the Indemnified Party shall
promptly send to the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying (to the
extent known) the nature of such claim and the amount of all related Losses (a
"Claim Notice"); provided, however, that any failure to give such Claim Notice
or to provide any such facts or amounts shall not affect the rights of the
indemnified parties except to the extent that such failure actually prejudices
the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

(b) In the event of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect to
retain counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable to the relevant
Indemnified Parties, to represent such Indemnified Parties in connection with
such Action and shall pay the fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel.
Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Parties may participate, at their own expense and
through legal counsel of their choice, in any such Action, provided that (i)
the Indemnifying Party may elect to control the defense of the Indemnified
Parties in connection with such Action and (ii) the Indemnified Parties and
their counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party's counsel in
connection with such Action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or continue
control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim if (A) such Third-Party Claim
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, (B) such
Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against any
Indemnified Party (other than in cases where the primary remedy being sought
by such third party or Governmental Authority is monetary damages), (C) such
Third-Party Claim has or would reasonably be expected to result in Losses
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this clause (C),
any Tax excess) in excess of the Cap, (D) the Indemnifying Party has failed or
is failing to defend in good faith such Third-Party Claim, or (E) such Third-
Party Claim arises out of any Release or noncompliance with any Environmental
Law at any Real Property. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
settle, compromise or discharge a Third-Party Claim either (I) with the prior
written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or (II) without any Indemnified
Party's consent if such settlement, compromise or discharge (x) provides for
no relief other than the payment of monetary damages and such monetary damages
are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, (y) includes as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the Person(s) asserting such Third-Party Claim to
all Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from all liability with
respect to such Third-Party Claim and (z) does not contain an admission of
liability on the part of any Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
not consent to the entry of any judgment which would impose any injunctive or
equitable relief on the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Indemnifying Party elects not to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the relevant Indemnified Parties and assume control of such defense within a
reasonable period of time or if both the Indemnifying Party and any
Indemnified Party are parties to or subjects of such Action and conflicts of
interests exist between the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party,
then the Indemnified Parties shall retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party in connection with such Action and assume control of the
defense of the Indemnified Parties in connection with such Action, and the
fees, charges and disbursements of no more than one such counsel per
jurisdiction selected by the Indemnified Parties shall be reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party. Whether the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party
controls the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the parties hereto shall
cooperate in the defense thereof in accordance with Section 12.02(c). Under no
circumstances will the Indemnifying Party have any liability in connection
with any settlement of any Action that is entered into without its prior
written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

123  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(c) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice, at the reasonable request
of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant the Indemnifying
Party and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours,
to the books, records, personnel and properties of the Indemnified Party to
the extent reasonably related to the Claim Notice at no cost to the
Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
expenses of the Indemnified Parties); provided that the Indemnifying Party
shall take reasonable precautions so as not to jeopardize any privilege
reasonably available to an Indemnified Party in respect of any of its records.

  

  

(d) In the event of a Direct Claim, within thirty (30) calendar days of
delivery of a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution
of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within such 30-day
period, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in a court of competent
jurisdiction pursuant to Section 13.10.

  

  

Section 12.03 No Duplication; Exclusive Remedy.

  

  

(a) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery (i) by reason of the state of facts giving rise to
such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement (and for purposes of clarity there shall be no
liability for a breach of any covenant where the primary purpose of such
covenant is to maintain the truth or correctness of any representation or
warranty or of notifying a party about any untruth or incorrectness of any
representation or warranty other than what is available for the breach of such
underlying representation or warranty) or (ii) to the extent such liability
was already taken into account under Section 2.04 or Section 2.05.

  

  

(b) From and after the applicable Closing and except (i) as expressly provided
in Section 2.04, Section 2.05, Section 6.16 and the Ancillary Agreements
(other than the HHI Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the HHI Bill of Sale,
the IP Assignment Agreements, the TLM Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the
TLM Bill of Sale or the Foreign Acquisition Agreements), (ii) in the case
where a party seeks to obtain specific performance pursuant to Section 13.13
and (iii) for claims arising out of fraud, the exclusive remedy of the parties
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether under this contract or arising under common law or any other Law)
shall be as provided in this Article XII, including any claim or right of
contribution that is premised on the ownership or use of Transferred Assets or
assets of any Transferred Entity by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries before
the applicable Closing.

  

  

Section 12.04 Limitation on Set-Off.

  

  

(a) Purchaser shall not have any right to set off any unresolved
indemnification claim pursuant to this Article XII against, and there shall
not otherwise be any right to set off or counterclaim in the event of the non-
performance of any obligation to make, (i) any payment due pursuant to Article
II, (ii) any payment due under the HHI Transition Services Agreement, the TLM
Transition Services Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, or (iii) any
payment due pursuant to Section 6.04(a) or Section 6.15(e).

  

  

(b) Seller shall not have any right to set off any unresolved indemnification
claim pursuant to Article XII against, and there shall not otherwise be any
right to set off or counterclaim in the event of the non-performance of any
obligation to make, (i) any payment due pursuant to Section 2.04 or Section
2.05, (ii) any payment due under the HHI Transition Services Agreement, the
TLM Transition Services Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, or (iii)
any payment due pursuant to Section 6.04(a).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

124  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Section 12.05 Mitigation.

  

  

(a) Purchaser and Seller shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to) cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability
with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other party
under this Article XII, including by making commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate to the extent required by Law, whether by seeking claims against a
third party, an insurer or otherwise, and to resolve any such claim or
liability; provided, however, that any costs of mitigation shall be included
in the amount recoverable by a party under this Article XII and that an
Indemnified Party shall nevertheless be entitled to bring a claim for
indemnification under this Article XII in respect of such Losses and no
Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have any obligation to pursue any insurance
recovery except as pursuant to Section 6.06(c) or in respect of a Transferred
Policy or to commence any Action against any insurer or third party.

  

  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, no party shall be liable under this Article
XII for Losses consisting of exemplary, special, indirect, consequential,
remote, speculative, punitive or treble damages, lost profits or internal
costs; provided, however, that this sentence shall not limit a party's right
to recover under this Article XII for any such Losses to the extent that (x)
such Losses were reasonably foreseeable or (y) such party is required to pay
such Losses to a third party in connection with a matter for which such party
is otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XII.

  

  

Section 12.06 Potential Contributors. If an Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of Losses and the Indemnified
Party could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third party
based on the underlying claim or demand asserted against such Indemnifying
Party, then such Indemnified Party shall transfer such of its rights to
proceed against such third party as are necessary to permit such Indemnifying
Party to recover from such third party the amount of such payment.

  

  

Section 12.07 Tax Indemnification.

  

  

(a) From and after the First Closing Date or, in the case of Losses relating
to or in respect of TLM Philippines, the Second Closing Date, Seller shall
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Persons against and hold them harmless
from any Losses arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of, except
as provided in Section 12.07(b), (i) any Taxes imposed on the Business or the
Transferred Entities with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) any
Taxes that are Retained Liabilities hereunder, (iii) any Taxes imposed on a
Transferred Entity as a result of its inclusion with Seller or any Subsidiary
Transferor in a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax group, or an integrated
fiscal unit and (iv) any Transfer Taxes for which Seller is liable under
Section 8.01, but excluding any Taxes taken into account in the adjustment
described in Section 2.04 or Section 2.05.

  

  

(b) From and after the First Closing Date or, in the case of Losses relating
to or in respect of TLM Philippines, the Second Closing Date, Purchaser and
the Transferred Entities shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the Seller
Indemnified Persons and hold them harmless from any Losses arising from,
relating to or otherwise in respect of (i) any Taxes imposed on the Business
or the Transferred Entities with respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period, or
(ii) any Transfer Taxes for which Purchaser is liable under Section 8.01, but
excluding any Taxes taken into account in the adjustment described in Section
2.04 or Section 2.05.

  

  

(c) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
First Closing Date or, in the case of TLM Philippines, the Second Closing Date
(a "Straddle Period"):

  

  

(i) Property Taxes and similar ad valorem obligations of the Business for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
according to the method described in Section 8.03. If at the time of the
applicable Closing, the tax rate or the assessed valuation for the year in
which the applicable Closing occurs has not yet been fixed, Property Taxes
shall be prorated based upon the tax rate and the assessed valuation
established for the previous tax year; and

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

125  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(ii) the Taxes of the Business (other than Property Taxes and similar ad
valorem obligations) for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if
such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the applicable
Closing Date.

  

  

(d) Overlap. To the extent that any indemnification provided for in this
Section 12.07 may overlap or conflict with any indemnification contained in
Section 12.01(a), the provisions of this Section 12.07 shall govern.

  

  

(e) Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims.

  

  

(i) Promptly after a party (the "Tax Indemnified Party") becomes aware of the
existence of a Tax issue that may give rise to an indemnification claim under
this Section 12.07 (a "Tax Controversy") by it against the other party (the
"Tax Indemnifying Party"), the Tax Indemnified Party shall notify the Tax
Indemnifying Party of the Tax issue and thereafter shall promptly forward to
the Tax Indemnifying Party copies of the relevant portion of any notice or
other document received from any Taxing Authority and communications with any
Taxing Authority relating to such Tax Controversy; provided, however, that a
failure to give such notice will not affect such other party's rights to
indemnification under this Article XII, except to the extent that such party
is actually prejudiced thereby. In the event that after the First Closing Date
or, in the case of TLM Philippines, the Second Closing Date, any Tax
Indemnified Party pays any Tax that is the responsibility of the Tax
Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 12.07(a), such Tax Indemnifying Party
shall within five (5) Business Days reimburse the Tax Indemnified Party,
provided that the Tax Indemnified Party has complied with the provisions of
this Section 12.07(e) and has given documentation to the Tax Indemnifying
Party establishing the fact and the amount of payment.

  

  

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 12.07(e)(ii), after the
First Closing Date or, in the case of TLM Philippines, the Second Closing
Date, Purchaser shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own
choosing, of any Tax Controversy with respect to any of the Transferred
Entities or the Transferred Assets. In the case of a Contest after the
applicable Closing Date that relates solely to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, Seller may elect to control the handling, settling or contesting of
any such Tax Controversy, but Purchaser shall have the right to participate in
such Tax Controversy at its own expense. Seller shall not settle, compromise
and/or concede any portion of such Tax Controversy without obtaining
Purchaser's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. In the case of a Tax Controversy with respect to a
Straddle Period, Purchaser may elect to control the handling, settling or
contesting of any such Tax Controversy, but Seller shall have the right to
participate in such Tax Controversy at its own expense. Purchaser shall not
settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax Controversy without
obtaining Seller's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Tax Indemnifying Party shall keep the
Tax Indemnified Party reasonably informed as to the progress of any Tax
proceeding with respect to a Tax Controversy to the extent such Tax proceeding
relates to Taxes payable by or with respect to the Transferred Entities or
Transferred Assets and shall consider in good faith any written comments or
suggestions regarding such Tax proceeding from the Tax Indemnified Party.

  

  

(f) For purposes of this Section 12.07, all Losses in respect of Taxes shall
be reduced by (i) any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
actually paid to Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person by any third
party with respect to such Loss, and (ii) an amount equal to any net reduction
of income Taxes of Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person attributable
to a Tax benefit actually realized in the year of such Loss as a direct result
of such Loss, and shall be increased by any additional Tax costs arising as a
result of the receipt of an indemnification payment hereunder with respect to
such Loss.

  

  

(g) Seller's indemnity obligations under this Section 12.07 shall survive
until the date that is sixty (60) days from the date of the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitation (including all periods of extension, whether
automatic or permissive), and such indemnity obligations shall not be subject
to any of the limitations set forth in Section 12.01(b).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

126  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Section 12.08 Effect of Knowledge. The right to indemnification, payment of
Losses or other remedies based on any representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement or in any document delivered with
respect hereto will not be affected by any investigation conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge or information acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or the relevant Closing, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement (other than disclosures made
in the Seller Disclosure Schedule hereto).

  

  

Section 12.09 TLM Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify, defend or hold
harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Article XII with
respect to any matter involving TLM Philippines, the Transferred TLM Assets or
the Assumed TLM Liabilities until the Second Closing has been consummated and

Section 13.04 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 13.05 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any applicable Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not fundamentally
changed. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that

to the greatest extent possible.

with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements
and undertakings, both written and oral, between Seller and Purchaser with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

  

  

Section 13.07 Assignment. Neither party may transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other party;
provided, however, that (i) Purchaser may (a) assign any or all of its rights
and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates or (b) designate one
or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder, in each case,
if Purchaser nonetheless remains fully responsible for the performance of
their respective obligations hereunder and (ii) Purchaser may assign all or a
portion of its rights and obligations to any Financing Source as collateral in
connection with the Debt Financing and any such Financing Source may exercise
all of the rights and remedies of Purchaser hereunder in connection with the
enforcement of any security or exercise of any remedies to the extent
permitted under the Debt Financing documentation. Any transfer in violation of
this Section 13.07 shall be null and void.

  

  

Section 13.08 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties and their permitted assigns and, in the case of Section
2.02(a), Section 2.02(b) and Section 6.08(a), Seller's Affiliates, and nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; provided, however, that the
Financing Sources shall be made third-party beneficiaries as to Section
11.02(d), Section 11.02(e)(i), Section 11.04(d), Section 11.04(e)(i), Section
12.03, Section 13.08, Section 13.10, Section 13.12 and the last proviso of

129  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each party hereto (i)
agrees that any claim, action or proceeding by such party seeking any relief
whatsoever arising out of, relating to or in connection with, this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought only in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York or in any New York
State court, in each case, located in the Borough of Manhattan and not in any
other State or Federal court in the United States of America or any court in
any other country, (ii) agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts located in the Borough of Manhattan for purposes of all legal
proceedings arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) waives and agrees not to assert any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such Action brought in such a court or any claim that any such Action brought
in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iv) agrees that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in Section 13.03 or any other manner as may
be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof, (v) agrees
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law and (vi) agrees that New York State or
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the County of New
York, Borough of Manhattan, and any appellate court from any thereof, shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over any action, claim, suit or proceeding of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, brought against any Financing Sources in connection with
the Agreement, any transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Debt
Financing contemplated by this Agreement. The preceding sentence shall not
limit the jurisdiction of the Accounting Arbitrator set forth in Section 2.04
or Section 2.05, although claims may be asserted in such courts described in
the preceding sentence for purposes of enforcing the jurisdiction and
judgments of the Accounting Arbitrator. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each party hereto agrees not to support and each party's Affiliates
agree not to bring or support any claim, suit or proceeding of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against Financing Sources and their respective current, former or
future directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
members, managers, controlling persons, Affiliates or employees in any way
relating to the Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or
the Debt Financing contemplated by this Agreement, in any forum other than New
York State or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the
County of New York, Borough of Manhattan, and any appellate court from any
thereof.

  

  

Section 13.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic means (including portable document format) shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 13.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect to any litigation, claim, suit or proceeding of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including any
such action involving the Financing Sources). Each party (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other parties have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 13.12.

  

  

Section 13.13 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and that any breach of this Agreement could not be adequately compensated in
all cases by monetary damages alone. The parties acknowledge and agree that,
prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01,
the parties shall be entitled, without posting a bond or similar indemnity, to
obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court as specified in Section 13.10, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity; provided,
however, that Seller shall not be entitled to obtain specific performance of
Purchaser's obligation to consummate the First Closing pursuant to Section
2.06(a) unless each of the following conditions are satisfied: (a) all of the
conditions set forth in Section 9.02 have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the First Closing, but
subject to such conditions being capable of being satisfied), (b) the Debt
Financing has been funded or will be funded at the First Closing, (c)
Purchaser has failed or indicated that it will fail to complete the First
Closing in accordance with Section 2.06(a), and (d) Seller has confirmed to
Purchaser in writing that if specific performance is granted and the Debt
Financing is funded, and Purchaser otherwise complies with its obligations
hereunder, then the First Closing will occur.

  

  

Section 13.14 No Presumption. The parties to this Agreement agree that this
Agreement was negotiated fairly between them at arms' length and that the
final terms of this Agreement are the product of the parties' negotiations.
Each party represents and warrants that it has sought and received legal
counsel of its own choosing with regard to the contents of this Agreement and
the rights and obligations affected hereby. The parties agree that this
Agreement shall be deemed to have been jointly and equally drafted by them,
and that the provisions of this Agreement therefore should not be construed
against a party or parties on the grounds that the party or parties drafted or
was more responsible for drafting the provisions.
