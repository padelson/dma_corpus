Except as contemplated by _Section 4.2(c)_, the Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose. 

  

 (ii) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand) to each Holder (A) a letter of transmittal (in a form approved by the Company), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto or cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Shares to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_. 

  

 (iii) Each Holder of a Certificate representing any Company Common Shares that have been converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in _Section 4.1(a)_ shall, upon surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a Certificate or Certificates representing that number of whole Parent Common Shares to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ after taking into account all Company Common Shares held by such Holder and the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be marked canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.

   #####

_Section 4.5_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to
such whole Parent Common Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,

Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after

The exercise price per share of each Company Converted Option shall equal the quotient of (A) the exercise price per share under the corresponding Company Employee Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

Such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any dividends or other distributions made in respect of Parent Common Shares or to the right to vote or any other rights of a shareholder of Parent.

 (b) _Rules Applicable to Computation of Recalculated Exchange Ratio_. For purposes of the computation to be made pursuant to _Section 4.6(a)_, the following provisions shall apply: 

   

 (i) _Type of Consideration_. 

   

 (A) _Cash Consideration_. In case of any transaction described in _Section 4.6(a)_ involving the receipt or payment of cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the cash proceeds before deducting any commissions or other expenses paid or incurred for any underwriting of, or otherwise in connection with the issuance of any equity securities. 

   

 (B) _Non-Cash Consideration_. In case of any transaction described in _Section 4.6(a)_ involving the receipt or payment of consideration other than cash, or a consideration a part of which shall be other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the value of such consideration at the time of its receipt or payment as determined in good faith and approved by the Audit Committee of the Company Board, except that where the non-cash consideration consists of the cancellation, surrender or exchange of outstanding obligations of the Company (or where such obligations are otherwise converted into Company Common Shares), the value of the non-cash consideration shall be deemed to be the principal amount of the obligations canceled, surrendered, satisfied, exchanged or converted. If such non-cash consideration consists in whole or in part of publicly traded securities (i.e., in lieu of cash), the value of such non-cash consideration shall be the aggregate fair market value of such securities (based on the latest reported sale price) as of the close of the day immediately preceding the date of their receipt or payment. 

  

 (ii) _Options, Warrants, Convertibles, Etc._  

   

 (A) In case of any transaction described in _Section 4.6(a)_ involving (1) any security that is convertible into Company Common Shares or (2) any rights, options or warrants to purchase Company Common Shares, there shall be deemed to have been issued or purchased, for the consideration described below, the number of Company Common Shares into which such convertible security may be converted when first convertible, or the number of Company Common Shares deliverable upon the exercise of such rights, options or warrants when first exercisable, as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 4.6(b)(ii)_ shall not apply to Company Employee Options. 

   

 (B) The consideration deemed to be received or paid at the time of any transaction involving such convertible securities or such rights, options or warrants shall be the consideration so received determined as provided in _Sections_  

   ##### 

  

 

 _4.6(b)(i)(A)_ and _4.6(b)(i)(B)_ hereof plus (x) any consideration or
adjustment payment to be received or paid in connection with such conversion
or, as applicable, (y) the aggregate price at which Company Common Shares are
to be delivered upon the exercise of such rights, options or warrants when
first exercisable (or, if no price is specified and such Company Common
Shares are to be delivered at an option price related to the fair market value
of the subject Company Common Shares, an aggregate option price bearing the
same relation to the fair market value of the subject Company Common Shares
at the time such rights, options or warrants were granted). 

   

 (iii) _Consideration to be Paid or Received_. In the event that any transaction described in _Section 4.6(a)_ is not completed prior to the Effective Time, then the amount to be paid or received in connection with such transaction shall be determined as of the date of the public announcement of such transaction. 

  

 (c) _Procedure_.

expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the chief executive

The Voting Agreement shall not have been amended, modified or supplemented without the consent of all parties thereto and shall be in full force and effect on the Closing Date.
