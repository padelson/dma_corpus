on the achievement by or on behalf of Buyer or its affiliates, licensees,
sublicensees or transferees of the corresponding Milestone Event set forth in
the table below. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, a Contingent Payment shall be due and payable only

Milestone Event) and shall be paid by Buyer to Seller promptly, but in no
event later than forty-five (45) calendar days following the occurrence of the

doubt, the Milestone Events need not be achieved in any order and a Contingent
Payment with respect to any Milestone Event may be paid before
another Contingent Payment with respect to any other Milestone Event.

after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be
prepared and delivered, to Seller a closing statement (the "Closing
Statement"), setting forth the calculation of the actual Net Working Capital
as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Net Working Capital") prepared in
accordance with GAAP Consistently Applied, together with all reasonable
supporting calculations for each component thereof.

 

(b) _Disputed Final Adjustment_.

 

(i) Within thirty (30) days following receipt by Seller of the Closing
Statement, Seller shall deliver written notice (an "Objection Notice") to
Buyer of any dispute it has with respect to the preparation or content of the
Closing Statement. An Objection Notice must describe in reasonable detail the
items contained in the Closing Statement that Seller disputes and the basis
for any such disputes. Any items not disputed in the Objection Notice will be
deemed to have been accepted by Seller and shall be deemed final, conclusive
and binding on the Parties hereto. If Seller does not deliver an Objection
Notice with respect to the Closing Statement within such thirty (30)-day
period, such statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties
hereto. If Seller delivers a timely Objection Notice, Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Buyer and Seller,
notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute within
thirty (30) days after Seller delivers an Objection Notice, then Buyer and
Seller jointly shall engage the Expert to resolve such dispute in accordance
with this Agreement and the standards set forth in this _Section 1.4(b)_. As
promptly as practicable thereafter (and, in any event, within thirty (30)
days after the Experts engagement), Seller shall submit any unresolved
elements set forth in the Objection Notice to the Expert in writing (with a
copy to Buyer), supported by any documents and arguments upon which
it relies. As promptly as practicable thereafter (and, in any event, within
fifteen (15) days following Sellers submission of such unresolved elements),
Buyer shall submit its response to the Expert (with a copy to Seller)
supported by any documents and arguments upon which it relies.
Notwithstanding any provisions hereof to the contrary, the Expert shall be
deemed to be acting as an expert and not as an arbiter and the proceeding
before the Expert shall be an expert determination under the Law governing
expert determination and appraisal proceedings. The Expert may, at its
discretion, conduct a conference concerning the disagreement with Seller and
Buyer. In connection with such process, other than any such conference,
there shall be no hearings, oral examinations, testimony, depositions,
discovery or other similar proceedings conducted by any party or by the
Expert. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any _ex parte_ communications with
the Expert without the prior consent of Buyer or Seller, as the case may be.
The Expert shall review such submissions and base its determination solely on
the submissions made by Seller and Buyer and not by any independent review.
Buyer and Seller shall request that the Expert render its determination as
soon as reasonably possible following its receipt of Buyers response. The
scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Expert is limited to the
unresolved items in the Objection Notice. In resolving any disputed item, the
Expert may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
claimed for such item by either Buyer or

 



8  Seller or less than the smallest value claimed for such item by either Buyer
or Seller. All determinations made by the Expert will be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties and will be enforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction.

(ii) In the event Seller and Buyer submit any unresolved objections to the
Expert for resolution as provided in _Section 1.4(b)(i)_ above, the fees,
costs and expenses of the Expert (A) shall be paid by Buyer in the proportion
that the aggregate dollar amount of such disputed items so submitted that are
successfully disputed by Seller (as finally determined by the Expert) bears to
the aggregate dollar amount of such items so submitted and (B) shall be paid
by Seller in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such disputed
items so submitted that are unsuccessfully disputed by Seller (as finally
determined by the Expert) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of such items
so submitted.

 

(iii) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 1.4_, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with and make available to the
other party and its representatives all information, records, data and working
papers as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation and
analysis of the Closing Statement and the resolution of any disputes under
the Closing Statement; _provided_ , that in order to review such information,
records, data and working papers, Seller and its representatives shall execute
any releases or waivers customarily required by Buyers independent
accountants in connection with such review.

 

(iv) "Final Net Working Capital" shall mean (A) if an Objection Notice is
not delivered within the time period required by this _Section 1.4(b)_ , the
amount of the Closing Net Working Capital set forth on the Closing Statement
as prepared by Buyer in accordance with _Section 1.4(a)_ , (B) the amount
agreed as the Final Net Working Capital at any time in writing by Buyer and
Seller or (C) the Final Net Working Capital as set forth in the written
determination of the Expert made in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 1.4(b)_.

 

(c) _Payment Following Adjustment_.

 

(i) If the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the Final Net
Working Capital, then the final Upfront Payment will be adjusted downward by
the amount of such excess (the absolute value of such amount, the "Downward
Adjustment Amount") and Buyer and Seller shall promptly (but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days from the date on which the Final Net Working
Capital is finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_ ), deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
deliver from the escrow account to Buyer an amount equal to the Downward
Adjustment Amount by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Downward Adjustment Amount exceeds the Escrow Amount, then the amount
released to Buyer from the escrow account shall be equal to the Escrow Amount
and Seller shall promptly (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days
from the date on which the Final Net Working Capital is finally
determined pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_ ), pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer
an amount equal to the absolute value of the

 



9  difference between the Downward Adjustment Amount and the Escrow Amount by
bank wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Buyer. If the Escrow Amount exceeds the Downward Adjustment
Amount, then Buyer and Seller shall promptly deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to
Seller an amount equal to the absolute value of the difference between
the Escrow Amount and the Downward Adjustment Amount, by bank wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Seller.

 

(ii) If the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Net
Working Capital, then the final Upfront Payment will be adjusted upward by
the amount of such excess (the absolute value of such amount, the "Upward
Adjustment Amount"), and Buyer shall promptly (but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days from the date on which the Final Net Working Capital is
finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_ ) pay, or cause to be paid, to
Seller by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Seller, an amount equal to the Upward Adjustment
Amount. Additionally, if the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the
Estimated Net Working Capital, Buyer and Seller shall promptly (but in no
event later than five (5) Business Days from the date on which the Final Net
Working Capital is finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_ ) deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
deliver from the escrow account an amount equal to the Escrow Amount by
bank wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Seller.

1.5 _Consents to Assignment_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, if the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
delivery or attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to
Buyer of any asset that would be an Acquired Asset is (a) prohibited by any
applicable Law or (b) would require any authorizations, approvals, consents or
waivers from a Third Party or Governmental Entity and such authorizations,
approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been obtained prior to the
Closing, then in either case the Closing shall proceed without the sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of such asset and this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement for the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery of such asset; _provided_ that nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ shall be deemed to waive the rights of Buyer not to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if the conditions
to its obligations set forth in _Article V_ have not been satisfied. In the
event that the Closing proceeds without the sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery of any such asset, then following the Closing, Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain promptly such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers. Pending such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver, (i) Seller will comply with the terms of, and
will not amend, transfer, let lapse or terminate, the applicable asset
without Buyers written consent and (ii) the Parties shall cooperate with each
other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful arrangements designed
to provide to Buyer the benefits of use of such asset, including, at Buyers
request and expense, reasonably assisting Buyer in obtaining the issuance or
reissuance of any of Sellers Environmental Permits that are not transferable
and/or obtaining authorization for Buyer to operate pursuant to Sellers
Environmental Permits in lieu of or pending the transfer, issuance or
reissuance of such Environmental Permits, and to Seller the benefits,
including any indemnities, that, in each case, it would have obtained had the
asset been conveyed to Buyer at the Closing. To the extent that Buyer is
provided the benefits pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ of any Contract,

 



10  Buyer shall (x) perform for the benefit of the other parties thereto the
obligations of Seller or any affiliate of Seller thereunder and (y) satisfy
any related Liabilities with respect to such Contract that, but for the lack
of an authorization, approval, consent or waiver to assign such obligations or
Liabilities to Buyer, would be Assumed Liabilities. Once authorization,
approval, consent or waiver for the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
delivery of any such asset not sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed or
delivered at the Closing is obtained, Seller shall assign, transfer, convey
and deliver such asset to Buyer at no additional cost to Buyer.

 

1.6 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each
of the Parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all documents and to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions that may be reasonably necessary or appropriate
to effectuate the provisions of this Agreement, provided that all such
actions are in accordance with applicable Law. From time to time, whether at
or after the Closing, (i) Seller shall execute and deliver such further
documents or instruments of conveyance, transfer and assignment and take all
such other action as Buyer may reasonably require to more effectively convey,
transfer and assign to Buyer any and all ownership, right, title and interest
in and to the Acquired Assets, including executing documents or instruments
necessary to permit Buyer to record the transfer, conveyance and/or assignment
of any and all Transferred IP with any Governmental Entity and (ii) Buyer, and
any other member of the Buyer Group, will execute and deliver such
further instruments and take all such other action as Seller may reasonably
require for such member of the Buyer Group to assume the Assumed Liabilities.

Business or any of the Acquired Assets.

2.5 _Financial Information_.

 

(a) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained in the Seller
SEC Documents (i) complied at the time it was filed with the SEC, in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis with Sellers past
practices throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the
rules and regulations of the SEC) and (iii) fairly presents, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of Seller as of the dates thereof and the respective periods indicated
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited interim statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments).

 

(b) Except as and to the extent set forth in the balance sheet of the
Commercial Business of the Seller and its Subsidiaries as of September 30,
2016 (the "Commercial Business Balance Sheet Date"), Seller has no material
Liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise) required by GAAP to be disclosed on a balance sheet that would
be an Assumed Liability, except for Liabilities and obligations (i) incurred
since the Commercial Business Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of the
Commercial Business or (ii) reasonably incurred in connection with, or
contemplated by, any Related Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

2.6 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since the Commercial Business Balance
Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, (a) except as contemplated or
permitted by this Agreement, Seller has conducted the Commercial Business in
the ordinary course of the Commercial Business and (b) there has not been any
Effect that has, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, since the Commercial Business Balance Sheet Date,
the Seller has not taken any action that, had it been taken after the date of
this Agreement, would be prohibited by the terms of _Section 4.1(b)_.

2.7 _Tax Matters_. Seller (with respect to the Commercial Business and
the Acquired Assets) has filed or had filed on its behalf all material Tax
Returns (as defined below) that it was required to file (separately or as part
of a consolidated, combined or unitary group) with respect to the Commercial
Business and the Acquired Assets and all such Tax Returns were correct and
complete in all material respects. Seller has paid (or had paid on its behalf)
all material Taxes 

 



13  that are due with respect to the Commercial Business and the Acquired
Assets, whether or not shown to be due on any such Tax Returns. All material
Taxes with respect to the Commercial Business and the Acquired Assets that
Seller is or was required by Law and pursuant to this Agreement to withhold or
collect and that were or are due have been duly withheld or collected and have
been timely paid or will be timely paid by Seller to the proper Governmental
Entity. There are no Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances) with
respect to the Acquired Assets for Taxes, nor is any Governmental Entity in
the process of imposing any such Encumbrance upon any Acquired Asset. No
audit or other examination of any Tax Return with respect to the Commercial
Business or the Acquired Assets is presently in progress, nor has Seller been
notified of any request for such an audit or other examination, and to the
knowledge of Seller, no such action or proceeding is being contemplated. No
adjustment relating to any Tax Return filed with respect to the Commercial
Business or the Acquired Assets has been proposed in writing by any Tax
authority which remains unresolved. No claim has been made by any
Governmental Entity in any jurisdiction where Seller does not file Tax Returns
that, with respect to the Commercial Business or the Acquired Assets, Seller
is, or may be, subject to Tax by that jurisdiction. No Acquired Asset is (i)
tax-exempt use property within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code or
(ii) an equity interest in any Person. No transaction contemplated by this
Agreement is subject to withholding under any provision of law. No extensions
or waivers of statutes of limitations have been given or requested with
respect to any Taxes with respect to the Commercial Business or the Acquired
Assets. With respect to the Commercial Business, Buyer will not be required
to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from,
taxable income for any Post-Closing Tax Period as a result of any (i)
installment sale or open transaction disposition made prior to the Closing
or (ii) prepaid amount received prior to the Closing.

2.8 _Real Property_.

 

(a) The Acquired Assets do not include any owned real property.

 

(b) _Section 2.8(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter contains a true,
correct and complete list of the leases with respect to real property to
which any of Seller or any of its affiliates is a party that will be subleased
to Buyer (each, a "Lease" and such real property that is the subject of a
Lease, the "Leased Real Property"). True, correct and complete copies of such
Leases (including all amendments, extensions, renewals, guaranties and
modifications with respect thereto) have been made available to Buyer. Except
as disclosed on _Section 2.8(b)_  of the Seller Disclosure Letter: (i) the
Leases are valid, binding and enforceable against Seller in accordance with
their respective terms, and there does not exist under any such Lease any
material default by Seller or, to Sellers knowledge, by any other Person, or
any event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default by Seller or, to Sellers knowledge, by any other Person; (ii) Seller
has not assigned, subleased, mortgaged, deeded in trust or otherwise
transferred any Lease or Leased Real Property or any interest therein other
than any sublease, mortgage or deed of trust which expired or otherwise
terminated prior to the date of this Agreement; (iii) no profit
sharing, recapture or other obligation, restriction or cancellation of any
option under, or termination of any Lease will arise as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) Seller has obtained from
each mortgagee of each landlord of each Leased Real Property whose mortgage
ranks in priority to the corresponding Lease an agreement in writing not to
disturb Sellers possession thereof while Seller is not in default under such
Lease and each such agreement is in full force and effect.

 



14 (c) Except as disclosed on _Section 2.8(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter: (i) Seller has not received written notice of any pending or to
Sellers knowledge, threatened expropriation, condemnation or eminent domain
proceedings or their local equivalent affecting or relating to the Leased
Real Property; (ii) Seller has not received written notice from any
Governmental Entity or other Person that the use and occupancy of such Leased
Real Property, as currently used and occupied, and the conduct of the business
thereon, as currently conducted, violates or is in material breach of any
applicable Law; (iii) to the knowledge of Seller, each parcel of Leased Real
Property is adequately served by utilities and other building services as
necessary for its current use by Seller; and (iv) to the knowledge of Seller,
the buildings and other structures on the Leased Real Property are in
materially sufficient repair and fit for the purposes for which they are used.

 

2.9 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) _Section 2.9(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete
and correct list of all registrations and applications for registration owned
by Seller that is contained within the Transferred IP ("Registered Business
IP") and, specifying as to each such item, as applicable, the owner(s) of
record (and, in the case of domain names, the registrant), jurisdiction of
application and/or registration, the application and/or registration number
and the date of application and/or registration.

 

(b) _Section 2.9(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete
and correct list of all agreements under which: (i) Seller uses or has been
granted any license rights under any material Intellectual Property related to
the Commercial Business or Transferred Products (other than off-the-shelf

$100,000 in licensing or other fees per software title per annum); (ii) Seller
has granted to any other Person any license rights under any material
Intellectual Property related to the Commercial Business or Transferred

the ordinary course of the Commercial Business in connection with the sale,

confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements entered into in the ordinary
course of business (the "NDAs"), material transfer (or other similar
research) agreements entered into in the ordinary course of the Commercial

employees and consultants assigning Intellectual Property to Seller) (the
agreements listed in subsections (i) through (iii) above, the "Transferred IP
Agreements"), identifying for each such agreement the parties to the agreement
and the date of the agreement. For purposes of greater certainty, the term
"license rights" in the definition of Transferred IP Agreements includes any

Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances) to the Transferred IP and to
use all material Third Party IP that is necessary for the operation of the
Commercial Business as currently conducted. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not result in the loss, forfeiture, termination,
license, or impairment of, or give rise to any obligation to transfer or to

the Transferred IP, including to continue the confidentiality of its trade
secrets and confidential information used in the Commercial Business,
including the use of written agreements, and, to Sellers knowledge, there has
been no misappropriation of any of such trade secrets or confidential
information. To the knowledge of Seller, no employee, officer, director,
consultant or advisor of Seller is in violation of any material term of any

determination, opinion or advisory letter from the IRS regarding such
qualification, and each trust created thereunder has been determined by the
IRS to be exempt from Tax under the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code,

payment or vesting or increase the amount due under any of the Business
Benefit Plans or (ii) entitle any Business Employee to severance or similar
compensation or satisfy any prerequisite to any severance or similar
compensation to any such individual.

compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, complies in

understood, however, that such Third Parties are not required to facilitate

hereby as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement and in any

consultation with the other Party and as promptly as practicable and
advisable after the date of this Agreement, all documentation (A) to effect

authorizations, including defending or contesting any suit, action, legal
proceeding or claim brought by a Third Party, including any Governmental
Entities, that would otherwise prevent or materially impede, interfere with,
hinder or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees (i) to
make all necessary applications, notices, petitions and filings required
(and thereafter make any other required submissions and respond as promptly
as practicable to any requests for additional information or documentary
material) with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ")
and the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") on a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
after the execution of this Agreement (unless another date is mutually agreed
between the Parties), and any other Governmental Entity under any other
applicable Antitrust Law and

 



30  (ii) to promptly determine whether any other filings are required to be made
with, and whether any other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are
required to be obtained from, any Governmental Entity under any other
applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and if

approvals, permits or authorizations (the filings described in the foregoing
_clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ collectively, "Regulatory Filings"). All filing fees
required in connection with the Regulatory Filings shall be borne equally by
Seller and Buyer.

 

(b) In connection with, and without limiting, the efforts or the
obligations of the Parties under  _Section 4.3(a)_ , each of Buyer and Seller
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and not prohibited by the
applicable Governmental Entity, (i) cooperate and coordinate in all respects
with the other in the making of Regulatory Filings (including, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, providing copies, or portions thereof, of all
such documents to the non-filing Parties prior to filing and considering all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the non-filing
Parties in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any
investigation, request or other inquiry of any Governmental Entity under any
applicable Law with respect to any such filing, (ii) supply the other Party
and its counsel, as applicable, with any information and reasonable assistance
that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with the making of
such filings, including, within the time allowed by the relevant Governmental
Entity and under applicable Law, any additional or supplemental information
that may be required or reasonably requested by the FTC, the DOJ and the
relevant Governmental Entities in any applicable jurisdiction in which any
such filing is made under any other applicable Law and (iii) use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting periods (and any extension thereof) under the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Law (the "Antitrust Approvals"), in each case as
soon as practicable, and to avoid any impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby under any applicable Law, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to take all such action as reasonably may be
necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity or Person may assert with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
_Section 4.3(b)_ , none of Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other
hand, shall be required to agree to any term or take or refrain from taking
any action in connection with obtaining the Antitrust Approvals that is not
conditioned upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall,
to the extent practicable and unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the
applicable Governmental Entity, promptly inform the other of any material
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby in connection with any Regulatory Filings or
investigations with, by or before any Governmental Entity relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any claims,
complaints, actions, suits, proceedings, hearings or investigations initiated
by a private party. If any Party or affiliate thereof shall receive a request
for additional information or documentary material from any Governmental
Entity with respect to a Regulatory Filing, then such Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable, an appropriate response in compliance with such
request. In

 



31  connection with and without limiting the foregoing, to the extent reasonably
practicable and unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Entity, the Parties will (i) give each other reasonable advance
notice of all meetings with any Governmental Entity relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) give each other an opportunity to
participate in each of such meetings, (iii) keep the other Party reasonably
apprised with respect to any material communications with any Governmental
Entity regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) cooperate in the
filing of any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
or other written communications explaining or defending the transactions
contemplated hereby, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument or
responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Entity, (v)
provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and
comment upon, and consider in good faith the views of the other with respect
to, all material written communications (including applications, analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and opinions) with a Governmental
Entity regarding the transactions contemplated hereby and (vi) provide each
other (or counsel of each Party, as appropriate) with copies of all material
written communications to or from any Governmental Entity relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Any such disclosures, rights to participate
or provisions of information by one Party to the other may be made on a
counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable Law. 

(d) Buyer will not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act (by pull and
refile, or otherwise) or any other Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement
with the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, except with the prior written consent of
Seller. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any business, Person
or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if
the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation
of, such acquisition could reasonably be expected to increase the risk of not
obtaining the applicable consent, clearance, approval, authorization or waiver
under the HSR Act or any Antitrust Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Each of Buyer and Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all of its respective consents, waivers, authorizations and
approvals of all Third Parties (other than Governmental Entities, which are
the subject of _clauses (a)_ - _(d)_ above) necessary, proper or advisable for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and to provide any
notices to Third Parties required to be provided by it prior to the Closing.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Buyer shall not be obligated to defend any action or proceeding instituted
(or threatened to be instituted) challenging the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws, or if any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order is entered, enforced or attempted to be
entered or enforced by a court or other Governmental Entity, which decree,
judgment, injunction or other order would make the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement illegal or would otherwise prohibit, prevent, restrict,
impair or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer is
not required to take any action to contest or resist any such action or
proceeding or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any such
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,

 



32  preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
to have such decree, judgment, injunction or other order repealed, rescinded,
or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable and in any event on or prior to the
Outside Date.

4.4 _Notices of Certain Events_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller
and Buyer shall promptly notify the other Party of any of the following after
gaining knowledge thereof:

 

(a) the breach or failure to be true and correct of any representation or
warranty made by it contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to
be true and correct would prevent the satisfaction by it of a condition in
_Section 5.2(a)_ or _5.3(a)_ , as applicable, prior to the Outside Date;

 

(b) the occurrence of any Effect that has, or would reasonably be expected
to cause or constitute, a Business Material Adverse Effect or Buyer Material
Adverse Effect, as applicable; and

(c) any material failure by such Party to comply with, in any material
respect, any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it hereunder, which
failure to comply with such covenant or agreement would prevent the
satisfaction by it of a condition in  _Section 5.2(b)_ or _5.3(b)_ , as
applicable, prior to the Outside Date.

4.5 _Release of Encumbrances_. At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall
(i) satisfy and discharge Sellers 11.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the
"Secured Notes"), pursuant to the indenture governing the Secured Notes,
such satisfaction and discharge to be effective no later than simultaneous
with the Closing, or (ii) provide Buyer with evidence reasonably satisfactory
to Buyer, of the release or termination of the Encumbrances securing the
Secured Notes, such release or termination to be effective no later than
simultaneous with the Closing.

4.6 _Supply Agreements_. In furtherance of _Section 4.1(b)(vii)_ , Seller
has provided to Buyer a draft of each of the supply agreements with the
counterparties who are set forth on _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ of the Seller

provide Buyer reasonable advance notice of all meetings with each supplier
and/or its respective advisors relating to the applicable Supply Agreement,

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, and except as otherwise specifically
provided for in this Agreement, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and controlled affiliates not to, and Seller shall instruct its
and its controlled affiliates Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or engage in any discussions or negotiations
with respect to any inquiry, proposal, discussion, offer or request that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal
(an "Inquiry") (other than informing any Person of the existence of the
provisions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 4.7_) ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller and its Representatives may make inquiries of a Person (and its
Representatives) making a Competing Proposal to ascertain facts regarding, and
clarify the terms of, such Competing Proposal for the purpose of the Seller
Board informing itself about such Competing Proposal and the Person
making it), (ii) terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which it or any of its
subsidiaries is a party with respect to any actual or potential Inquiry, (iii)
approve or publicly recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend,
any Competing Proposal, (iv) withdraw, change or qualify in a manner adverse
to Buyer, the Seller Board Recommendation or fail to include the Seller Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement when disseminated to the stockholders
of Seller, (v) enter into any agreement or commitment providing for any
Competing Proposal or (vi) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing (any
act described in _clauses (iii)_ ,  _(iv)_ or _(v)_ above, a "Seller Change
of Recommendation"). Any violation of the restrictions contained in this
_Section 4.7(a)_ by any of Sellers Representatives shall be deemed to be a
breach of this _Section 4.7(a)_ by Seller.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 4.7(a)_,
if, prior to the Seller Stockholder Approval being obtained, Seller receives a
_bona fide_ Competing Proposal that was not solicited in material breach of
_Section 4.7(a)_ , and the Seller Board determines in good faith after
consultation with Sellers outside legal counsel and financial advisors that
such Competing Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be likely to lead to,
a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then Seller and its Representatives may (i) furnish
information (including nonpublic information) to the Person making such
Competing Proposal, its Representatives and its potential sources of
financing, if, prior to so furnishing such information, Seller receives (or
has previously received) from such Person an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Person, its Representatives and its potential sources of financing with
respect to such Competing Proposal and any changes thereto, including by
making counterproposals thereto. Seller will promptly provide or make
available to Buyer any material nonpublic information concerning Seller
provided to any other Person pursuant to _Section 4.7(b_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ that was
not previously provided to Buyer.

 

(c) The Seller shall notify Buyer promptly after, to the knowledge of
Seller, the receipt of any Competing Proposal from and after the date of this
Agreement and provide Buyer with a copy of the Competing Proposal (or if the
Competing Proposal is not in writing, a description of the material terms of
the Competing Proposal). The Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of
the status of discussions relating to any such Competing Proposal. The Seller
will also promptly advise Buyer if the Seller determines to begin providing
information to or engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a
Competing Proposal pursuant to _Section 4.7(b)_.

 



34 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.7_ or _Section_ __
_ 4.8_ to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Seller
Stockholder Approval, the Seller Board may, in response to its receipt of a
_bona fide_ Competing Proposal, make a Seller Change of Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive written agreement
providing for such Competing Proposal pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ if (i) the
Seller Board has determined in good faith after consultation with Sellers
outside legal counsel and financial advisors that (x) such Competing Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) failure to make such Seller Change of
Recommendation or to so terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) Seller has provided
Buyer with a written notice of such determination and that the Seller Board
intends to effect a Seller Change of Recommendation pursuant to this _Section
4.7(d)_ or that Seller intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.2(b)_ and (iii) during the four (4) Business Day period commencing
on the date of Buyers receipt of such notice Seller has negotiated with
Buyer in good faith (to the extent Buyer desired to negotiate) to make a
possible amendment to this Agreement so as to enable Seller to proceed with
the Seller Board Recommendation and not effect a Seller Change of
Recommendation, and after taking account of Buyers proposals, if any, the
Seller Board again makes the determination set forth in _Section 4.7(d)(_ _i_
_)_. Each time the financial or other material terms of such Competing
Proposal are materially amended, the Seller will deliver to Buyer a new
notice, and the period of negotiation provided in the foregoing sentence shall
in no event end prior to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the date that is
two (2) Business Days immediately following Buyers receipt of such new
notice and specified agreements.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 4.7_ or  _Section_ __
_ 4.8_ to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Seller
Stockholder Approval, the Seller Board may make a Seller Change of
Recommendation in response to a Seller Intervening Event if (i) the
Seller Board has determined in good faith after consultation with Sellers
outside legal counsel and financial advisors that the failure to make a Seller
Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (ii) Seller has provided Buyer with a written
notice of such determination and that the Seller Board intends to effect a
Seller Change of Recommendation and (iii) during the four (4) Business Day
period commencing on the date of Buyers receipt of such notice Seller has
negotiated with Buyer in good faith (to the extent Buyer desired to negotiate)
to make a possible amendment to this Agreement so as to enable Seller to
proceed with the Seller Board Recommendation and not effect a Seller Change
of Recommendation, and after taking account of Buyers proposals, if any, the
Seller Board again makes the determination set forth in _Section 4.7(e)(_ _i_
_)_.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Seller or the Seller
Board from (i) complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
with respect to a Competing Proposal, (ii) issuing a "stop, look and
listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or
(iii) making any disclosure to its stockholders as reasonably required by
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that this  _Section 4.7(f)_ shall
not permit the Seller Board to make a Seller Change of Recommendation except
to the extent permitted by _Section 4.7(d)_ or _Section 4.7(e)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes
Sellers receipt of a Competing Proposal and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto shall not be deemed a Seller Change of Recommendation.

 



35 4.8 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Seller Stockholders  Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Seller shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy
Statement in preliminary form. Each of Seller and Buyer shall furnish all
information concerning itself, its affiliates and the holders of its shares to
the other and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by
such other Party in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution
of the Proxy Statement. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer upon the receipt of
any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after receipt thereof, provide Buyer with copies of all non-
routine correspondence related to the Proxy Statement between it and its
Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC and advise
Buyer of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from
the SEC. Seller shall respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any
comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, Seller shall provide Buyer a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response in advance and give due consideration to
such comments, except to the extent such disclosures relate to a Competing
Proposal.

(b) If, at any time prior to the Closing, any information relating to
Seller or Buyer, or any of their respective affiliates, should be discovered
by Seller or Buyer that, in the reasonable judgment of Seller or Buyer, should
be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so
that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party,
and Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the
extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to stockholders of Seller. Nothing in this _Section
4.8(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any Party under _Section 4.8(a)_. For
purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 4.8_, any information concerning or related
to Seller or its affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by Seller,
and any information concerning or related to Buyer or its affiliates will be
deemed to have been provided by Buyer.

(c) The Seller shall, in accordance with applicable Law and
Sellers charter and bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Seller Special Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, for the purpose of obtaining the
Seller Stockholder Approval. Subject to compliance with applicable Law,
Seller shall no later than as promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC
has advised that it will not provide further comments on the Proxy Statement
(or when the ten-day period referred to in Rule 14a-6 under the Exchange Act
has expired without receipt of SEC comments or notice from the SEC that it
will provide comments), mail the Proxy Statement to the stockholders of
Seller and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain the Seller
Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the Seller Board shall have
made a Seller Change of Recommendation as permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 4.7_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of

 



36  this _Section 4.8(c)_ , Seller shall be permitted to recess, adjourn,
postpone or delay the Seller Special Meeting without the prior consent of
Buyer if and to the extent that: (i) there are holders of an insufficient
number of Common Stock present or represented by a proxy at the Seller Special
Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Seller Special Meeting, provided that
any such recesses, adjournments, postponements or delays shall not cause the
Seller Special Meeting to be recessed, adjourned, postponed or delayed by more
than twenty (20) Business Days after the initial date established for the
Seller Special Meeting; (ii) Seller has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of Common Stock to obtain the Seller Stockholder Approval,
provided that any such adjournments, postponements or delays shall not cause
the Seller Special Meeting to be adjourned, postponed or delayed by more
than more than twenty (20) Business Days after the initial date established
for the Seller Special Meeting; (iii) such adjournment, postponement, delay or
cancellation is required by applicable Law or a request from the SEC or its
staff; or (iv) in the good faith judgment of the Seller Board (after
consultation with its outside legal advisors), the failure to adjourn,
postpone or delay the Seller Special Meeting would be reasonably likely to not
allow sufficient time under applicable Laws for the distribution and review
of any required or appropriate supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement
by Sellers stockholders prior to the Seller Special Meeting as then-
scheduled.

against, any and all claims, judgments, causes of action, losses, debts,

39  and settlement, and reasonable attorneys and other fees and expenses
(collectively, "Damages") incurred as a result or arising out of:

 

(a) any (i) breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in

Letter.

 

6.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this _Article VI_ , from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify Seller
and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, affiliates,
stockholders, members, partners and each of the heirs, executors, successors

6.3 _Claims for Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. All claims for indemnification made under this
Agreement resulting from, related to or arising out of a Third Party claim,
action, suit or proceeding (a "Third Party Claim") against an Indemnified
Party shall be made in accordance with the following procedures. A Person
entitled to indemnification under this _Article VI_ (an "Indemnified Party")
shall give prompt written notification to the Person from whom indemnification
is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the commencement of any Third Party
Claim for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the
written assertion of any such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying
Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability hereunder, except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been materially prejudiced
thereby, and then only to such extent. Within twenty (20) days after delivery
of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof
to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Third Party
Claim so long as (i) the Third Party

 



40  Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other
equitable relief, (ii) the maximum amount the Indemnified Party would be
entitled to recover under this _Article VI_ in respect of such Third Party
Claim is anticipated to be more than 50% of the total Damages likely to be
assessed against the Indemnified Party pursuant to such Third Party Claim and
(iii) prior to the Indemnifying Party assuming control of such defense, it
shall provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its financial
ability to assume the cost of such Third Party Claim and that, as between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, any Damages related to such
Third Party Claim shall be the responsibility of the Indemnifying Party
(subject to any applicable limitations provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.5_). If
the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of such defense in accordance
with the terms hereof, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The
Party not controlling such defense may participate therein at its own expense
and may retain separate co-counsel at its own expense; _provided_ that if the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party
reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to
such Third Party Claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the
Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith shall be considered Damages
for purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Indemnifying Party be responsible for the fees and expenses of more
than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties. The Party controlling such
defense shall keep the other Party advised of the status of such Third Party
Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the
other Party with respect thereto. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any
settlement of such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed so long as the Indemnifying Party is actively and
diligently defending in good faith any such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Third Party
Claim that (i) does not include a complete and unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party from all Liability with respect thereto, (ii) has a finding
or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any
Person, or (iii) imposes any Liability on the Indemnified Party, or any
matters with respect to Taxes, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Each of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall direct their respective counsel to reasonably cooperate with the
other.

 

(b) _Procedure for Other Claims_. An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a
claim for indemnification under this _Article VI_ which is not subject to
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written
notice (a "Claim Notice") which contains (i) a description and, if then
known, the amount (the "Claimed Amount") of any Damages incurred by the
Indemnified Party or the method of computation of the amount of such claim of
any Damages, (ii) a statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification under this _Article VI_ and a reasonable explanation of
the basis therefor, and (iii) a demand for payment in the amount of such
Damages (including wire instructions if payment is requested to be made by
wire transfer). Within thirty (30) days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response
in which the Indemnifying Party shall (A) agree that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case such response
shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified
Party of the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire

 



41  transfer), (B) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part,
but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the "Agreed Amount") (in which case such
response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party of the Agreed Amount, by check or by wire transfer), or (C)
contest that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed
Amount including the reasons therefor. If the Indemnifying Party in such
response contests the payment of all or part of the Claimed Amount, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within sixty
(60) days following the delivery by the Indemnifying Party of such response,
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall each have the right to
submit such dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 10.9_.

6.4 _Survival_.

 

(a) Other than claims alleging common law fraud or willful or intentional
misrepresentation or breach of this Agreement, the representations and
warranties of Seller and Buyer set forth in this Agreement and the
certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to _Sections_ __ _ 5.2(c)_ and
_5.3(c)_ shall survive the Closing for a period of sixteen (16) months, other
than for the representations and warranties of Seller contained in _Sections_
__ _ 2.1_ (Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power), _2.2_ (Title to
Assets), _2.3_  (Authority) and _2.18_ (Brokers Fees), and of Buyer
contained in _Sections_ __ _ 3.1_ (Organization), _3.2_ (Authorization of
Transaction) and _3.4_ (Brokers Fees), (collectively, the
"Fundamental Representations"), which shall survive the Closing for forty
(40) months.

(b) The covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing until the expiration of the term of the undertaking set
forth in such agreement and covenant.

 

(c) No Party shall have any Liability of any nature with respect to any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant after the termination
thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , any claim that is properly asserted in
writing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)_ shall
survive solely for the purpose of such claim until such claim is finally
resolved and satisfied.

 

6.5 _Limitations_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.13_, from and after the Closing, the
rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Article VI_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties with respect to claims
resulting from any breach of warranty or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise relating to the
transactions that are the subject of this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing two sentences, in no event shall Buyer, its
successors or permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek rescission of
the transactions consummated under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall relieve or limit the liability of any Party or any
officer or director of such Party from any liability arising out of or
resulting from common law fraud or intentional or willful misrepresentation in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in
connection with the delivery of any of the documents referred to herein.

 



42 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
each of the following limitations shall apply:

(i) the aggregate liability of Seller for all Damages under _Section_ __ _
6.1(a)(_ _i_ _)_ (other than on account of the breach of any Fundamental
Representation, with respect to which Sellers aggregate liability shall not
exceed an amount equal to the Base Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.4_)) and _Section 6.1(e)_ shall not exceed an amount equal
to $95,000,000 (the "Applicable Cap Amount"); and

 

(ii) a Buyer Indemnified Party shall have no right to indemnification
under  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)(_ _i_ _)_ (other than on account of the breach
of any Fundamental Representation as to which the limitation shall not apply)
or _Section 6.1(e)_ unless and until the amount of Damages suffered by such
Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to an individual claim under such
sections exceeds $50,000 and the aggregate amount of Damages suffered by such
Buyer Indemnified Party under such sections exceeds $250,000 (the
"Aggregate Threshold"), whereupon the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be
indemnified for all Damages (including Damages up to the Aggregate Threshold),
subject to the Applicable Cap Amount.

 

(c) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be responsible and liable for
any Damages or other amounts under this _Article VI_ that are special or
punitive Damages, except to the extent that any of the foregoing are awarded
to a Third Party against any Indemnified Party in circumstances in which such
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
any limitation or qualification as to materiality, Business Material Adverse
Effect or Buyer Material Adverse Effect shall be disregarded for purposes of
determining the amount of any Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligation
and whether there has been any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement.

 

(e) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under
this _Article VI_ shall be computed net of any Third Party insurance proceeds
actually received by the Indemnified Party (net of any retroactive premium
adjustments and any other costs of collection), each Party agreeing (i) to use
commercially reasonable efforts to recover all available insurance proceeds
and (ii) to the extent any indemnity payment under this Agreement has been
paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party prior
to the receipt, directly or indirectly by the Indemnified Party of any net
insurance proceeds under Third Party insurance policies on account of such
Damages which duplicate, in whole or in part, the payment by the Indemnifying
Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall
remit to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the amount of the net
insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party on account of
such Damages which duplicate, in whole or in part, the payment made by the
Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party.

 



43 6.6 _Right of Setoff_. Upon notice to Seller specifying in
reasonable detail the basis therefor, Buyer may set off any amount to which
it may be entitled under this _Article VI_ against amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_.

 

6.7 _Overdue Payments_. Any indemnification obligation under this _Article
VI_ not paid when due shall bear interest from the due date until the date of
payment thereof at a per annum rate equal to 2.00% plus the three (3)-month US
Dollar LIBOR rate in effect on the date such payment is required to be made,
from time to time, effective from the date that payment was due, compounded
monthly, provided that interest shall not accrue at a rate that exceeds the
maximum rate permitted by applicable Law, and provided further that interest
shall not accrue to the extent the Indemnifying Party is in good faith
contesting the right to indemnification hereunder.

6.8 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any payment by Buyer or Seller, as
the case may be, pursuant to this _Article VI_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the purchase price for the Acquired Assets for Tax purposes
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

consummation happens prior to or following such 12-month period), then within
three (3) Business Days after the date that such Competing Proposal is
consummated, Seller will pay or cause to be paid to Buyer the Seller
Termination Fee. For purposes of this _Section 7.2(b_ _)(_ _iii)_ , the term
"Competing Proposal" will have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section_
__ _ 10.1_, except that references to "20%" will be deemed to be references
to "50%".

 

(iv) If Buyer or Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(iii)_ , then Seller shall reimburse Buyer, or cause Buyer to be
reimbursed, for Buyers documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
_provided_ , _however_ , Sellers aggregate liability under this _Section
7.2(b)(iv)_ shall not exceed an amount equal to $3,000,000.

 

(v) In the event any amount is payable by Seller pursuant to the
preceding  _clauses(_ _i_ _)_ - _(iv)_ , such amount shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer. In
no event shall Seller be obligated to pay the Seller Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

Seller acknowledges that (A) the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _
7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that without this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ Buyer would not have entered into
this Agreement and (B) the Seller Termination 

 



46  Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Buyer in the circumstances in which the Seller
Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. If Seller fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, Seller shall pay to Buyer all reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of enforcement (including reasonable attorneys fees as
well as reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any action initiated
by Buyer), together with interest on the amount of the Seller Termination Fee
at the prime lending rate as published in _The_ _Wall Street Journal_ ,
Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such payment is required to be
made. Subject to Buyers rights set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.13_, Buyers
right to receive payment from Seller of the Seller Termination Fee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Related Parties against
Seller, any Seller Subsidiary or any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or
affiliates (collectively, "Seller Related Parties") for any loss suffered as a
result of the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and
upon payment of such amount (if entitled under this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_),
none of the Seller Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transaction
contemplated hereby (except that Seller shall also be obligated with respect
to _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, to the extent applicable, and except that Seller
shall remain obligated for, and Buyers and its affiliates may be entitled to
remedies with respect to, the provisions and agreements surviving such
termination pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ ).

 

ARTICLE VIII

TAX MATTERS

8.1 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Seller and Buyer shall be equally responsible for the payment of any
transfer, sales, use, stamp, conveyance, value added, recording,
registration, documentary, filing and other non-income Taxes and
administrative fees (including notary fees) arising in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Transfer
Taxes"). Buyer shall, at its own expense, timely file any Tax Return or other
document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and Seller shall cooperate with
respect thereto as necessary). Buyer and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other to minimize any Transfer
Taxes.

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for real property,
personal property and similar ad valorem Taxes for or with respect to the
Acquired Assets for a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date and
ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the Taxes for the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and for the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days during the Straddle

 



47  Period before and including the Closing Date, or the number of calendar days
during the Straddle Period beginning the day after the Closing Date, as
applicable, and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire Straddle Period; and

(ii) Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for all Taxes not
referenced in _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ (such as income, employee, payroll Taxes and
any Taxes imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment
of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)) it shall be
determined as if the Straddle Period ended at the end of the day on the
Closing Date (except that (x) solely for purposes of determining the marginal
Tax rate applicable to income or receipts during such period in
a jurisdiction in which such Tax rate depends upon the amount or level of
income or receipts, annualized income or receipts may be taken into account if
appropriate for an equitable sharing of such Taxes and (y) exemptions,
allowances and deductions that are otherwise calculated on an annual basis
shall be apportioned on a daily basis).

 

(c) Seller shall include in its taxable income all amounts received on or
before the Closing Date with respect to any deferred revenue liability (for
U.S. tax purposes) that is assumed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, and
the parties agree to treat any such deferred revenue liability in a manner
that will provide Buyer the opportunity to increase its tax basis in the
Acquired Assets for U.S. tax purposes as it fulfills the underlying obligation
associated with any such deferred revenue liability.

 

8.2 _Withholding Taxes_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Upfront Payment and any other payments pursuant to this Agreement
(including the Contingent Payments, if any) all Taxes that Buyer may be
required to deduct and withhold under any applicable provision of Tax law. All
such withheld amounts shall be treated as delivered to Seller and Buyer shall
remit or cause to be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity the
amounts withheld as required under any applicable provision of Tax law. Buyer
shall notify Seller at least four (4) Business Days prior to Closing of
any amount Buyer intends to withhold under this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_. Buyer
and Seller agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or mitigate
the imposition of any withholding Taxes.

 

8.3 _Tax Refunds_.

 

(a) Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof) received by
Seller, and any amounts credited against Tax that are actually utilized, to
which Seller becomes entitled (including by way of any amended Tax Returns or
any carryback filing), that relate to any Post-Closing Tax Period, shall be
for the account of Buyer and Seller shall pay over to Buyer any such refund
or the amount of any such credit, net of any costs or expenses incurred by
Seller in procuring such refund, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such
credit or entitlement thereto.

 

(b) Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof) received by
Buyer, and any amounts credited against Tax which are actually utilized to
which Buyer becomes entitled (including by way of any amended Tax Returns or
any carryback filing), that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, shall be
for the account of Seller and Buyer shall pay over to Seller any such refund
or the amount of any such credit, net of any costs or expenses incurred by
Buyer in procuring such refund, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such
credit or entitlement thereto.

 



48 (c) Each of Seller and Buyer shall cooperate, and cause each of their
Affiliates to cooperate, in obtaining any Tax refund that the other party
reasonably believes should be available, including through filing appropriate
forms with the applicable Governmental Entity.

 

8.4 _Tax Contests_. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Seller
within ten (10) days of its written receipt of any notice of Tax deficiency,
proposed Tax adjustment, Tax assessment, Tax audit, Tax examination or other
administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim primarily
with respect to Taxes (a "Tax Claim") that, if determined adversely to the
taxpayer or after the lapse of time would be grounds for a claim for indemnity
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
failure by Buyer to provide notice of a Tax Claim within such ten (10) day
period shall not entitle Seller to reduce the amount of the liability required
to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ unless such failure results in a
material detriment to Seller, in which case the amount Seller is required to
pay with respect to such liability shall only be reduced by the amount of such
detriment. Thereafter, Buyer shall deliver to Seller, as promptly as possible,
copies of all relevant notices and documents (including court papers)
received by Buyer. In the case of any Tax Claim, Buyer and Seller may each
participate, at its own expense, in the audit or proceeding; _provided_ that
the audit or proceeding shall be controlled by Buyer;  _provided_ , _further_
, that at Sellers election (upon written notice to Buyer) and its own
expense, Seller may take control of the audit or proceeding, provided Seller
agrees to indemnify Buyer for any resulting Taxes;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that (i) neither Party shall settle such audit or proceeding
without the consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and (ii) each Party shall keep
the other Party timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and
nature of any such Tax Claim.

 

8.5 _Tax Allocation_. Buyer shall prepare an allocation of the Upfront
Payment, the Contingent Payment, and any amount that would be treated as
consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes among the Acquired Assets
and the restrictions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury regulations thereunder (and
any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, as appropriate) (the
"Draft Allocation"). Buyer shall deliver the Draft Allocation to Seller within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. Seller shall review the Draft
Allocation and provide any objections to Buyer within fifteen (15) days after
the receipt thereof. In the event Seller does not object to Buyers Draft
Allocation, such Draft Allocation shall be final (the "Final Allocation"). If
Seller raises objections to the Draft Allocation or any subsequent
adjustments, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve such
objection(s). Any subsequent adjustments to the consideration for the
Acquired Assets shall be reflected in the Final Allocation as revised by Buyer
and subject to Sellers reasonable comments in a manner consistent with this
_Section_ __ _ 8.5_, the imputed interest provisions of the Code, Section
1060 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury regulations thereunder (and any
similar provisions of state, local or foreign Law, as appropriate). Seller,
Buyer and their respective consolidated Affiliates shall report and file Tax
Returns (including IRS Form 8594) in accordance with the Final Allocation.
Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax
Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such Final Allocation unless
required to do so by applicable Law.

 



49 ARTICLE IX

 

FURTHER AGREEMENTS

 

9.1 _Post-Closing Information_.

 

(a) For a period of seven (7) years following the Closing, upon written
request delivered to Buyer and subject to compliance with applicable Laws and
any established legal privilege, Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause the
affiliates of Buyer with respect to the Commercial Business to, provide to
Seller and its representatives (at Sellers sole cost and expense)
information in its possession, following receipt of a reasonable, written
request therefor, to the extent necessary to prepare or defend any judicial or
administrative proceeding related to the Commercial Business (other than any
proceeding between Buyer and Seller), or to enable Seller and its
representatives to satisfy Sellers and its affiliates financial reporting
and Tax preparation obligations. Buyer shall be entitled to receive from
Seller, upon the presentation of invoices therefor, payments for such
amounts, relating to supplies, disbursements and other out-of-pocket expenses,
as may reasonably be incurred in providing such information.

(b) After the Closing, Buyer shall respond to reasonable, written requests
for information and assistance by Seller in connection with Seller completing
the audit of its accounts and preparation of its required federal, state and
local Tax Returns.

 

9.2 _Disclosure Generally_. Any exception or disclosure set forth in any
section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall be deemed for the
purposes of this Agreement to be disclosed and shall modify any of Sellers
other representations, warranties, covenants or other matters to the extent
the applicability of such exception or disclosure to qualify one or more
other representations, warranties, covenants or other matters is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure. The inclusion of any information in
the Seller Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission
or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the
terms hereof to be disclosed, is material to the Commercial Business, has
resulted in or would result in a Business Material Adverse Effect, or is
outside the ordinary course of the Commercial Business. For purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "to the knowledge of Seller," "to Sellers knowledge,"
"known by Seller" or other words of similar meaning shall mean the actual
knowledge of the persons listed on _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter attached hereto and the knowledge such persons would have
had after reasonably investigating the relevant facts or circumstances, and
shall not refer to the knowledge of any other Person or entity.

9.3 _Certain Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) _Offer of Employment; Continuation of Employment_. Prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer agrees that it will make offers of employment to those
employees of Seller set forth as "Hire Employees" and may make offers of
employment to those additional employees of Seller set forth as "Transition
Hire Employees" in each case as identified on a schedule agreed upon by
Seller and Buyer prior to the date hereof (each, a "Business Employee"), in
each case in good faith, with: (i) salary or hourly wage rate, as the case may
be, no less than one hundred and two percent (102%) of that provided by
Seller immediately

 



50  prior to the date of this Agreement in the event Seller has not implemented
an ordinary course raise in compliance with _Section 4.1(b)(viii)_ prior to
the Closing Date with respect to such Business Employee (or one hundred
percent (100%) of such amount provided by Seller immediately prior to the
Closing Date if Seller has implemented an ordinary course raise in compliance
with _Section 4.1(b)(viii)_ prior to the Closing Date with respect to such
Business Employee); (ii) an annualized target cash incentive opportunity no
less favorable than that provided by Seller immediately prior to the Closing
Date, including a full-year bonus opportunity for 2017 (notwithstanding the
fact that the Business Employee is not employed by Buyer for the entirety of
2017 as a result of when the Closing occurs), in accordance with Buyers
standard bonus policies (the "2017 Bonuses"); (iii) compensation and
benefit opportunity programs based on Buyers eligibility criteria including
long-term incentive compensation commensurate with similarly situated
employees of Buyer that are based in the United States; (iv) eligibility to
participate in health, welfare and defined contribution retirement benefit
plans and programs that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, and at
a cost that is substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those health,
welfare and defined contribution retirement benefits provided by Seller
immediately prior to the Closing Date; (v) a severance plan that will be in
effect until the first anniversary of the Closing Date which shall provide for
severance payments and benefits in the event such Business Employees
employment is terminated without cause no less favorable than those provided
by Seller to such Business Employee immediately prior to Closing Date pursuant
to the terms of the applicable Business Benefit Plan;  _provided_ , _however_
, for the avoidance of doubt, that in no event shall Buyer assume Sellers
Change in Control Severance Plan or any individual severance agreement or
arrangement between Seller and any Business Employee that is not an Assigned
Contract; and (vi) employment no greater than fifty (50) miles from the
location at which the Business Employee was employed immediately prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers obligations hereunder
with respect to any Business Employees shall be subject to Buyers standard
background check policies (to the extent permitted by applicable Law), which
shall be conducted in accordance with the timeline and procedures mutually
agreed to by the Parties. Buyer shall offer employment commencing on the
Closing Date to all active Business Employees, including those on vacation, on
the terms set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_. With respect to any Business
Employee who is not actively employed on the Closing Date due to military
leave, an approved leave of absence (whether paid or unpaid), disability or
layoff, Buyer shall offer employment to such Business Employee as of the date
such Business Employee returns to active employment, provided that such date
is within one (1) year of the Closing Date (or, if later, only to the extent
that such Business Employee retains re-employment rights under applicable
Law). Any Business Employee that accepts employment with Buyer is referred to
herein as a "New Buyer Employee." Except as provided by Seller to Buyer on a
separate schedule 9.3(c), Seller retains all Liabilities with respect
to compensation and benefits owed to the Business Employees for pre-Closing
employment and shall satisfy any obligations in connection with any severance
or similar compensation owed to any Business Employee due to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in connection with
another event. Nothing herein shall establish, modify or amend any Business
Benefit Plan, or the terms and conditions of employment applicable to
a Business Employee, or change the at-will status of any Business Employee.

 



51 (b) _Compensation; Employee Benefits_. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, the Business Employees shall cease to participate in or accrue
further benefits under the Business Benefit Plans immediately prior to the
Closing. Beginning on the Closing Date and for a twelve (12) month period
thereafter, Buyer shall maintain (or cause its affiliates to maintain)
employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies and arrangements for
the benefit of each New Buyer Employee ("Buyer Plans") on terms that are
no less favorable than those set forth in _Section 9.3(a)_. Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause:

 

(i) all Buyer Plans (including severance pay plans, programs and practices)
to recognize all credited service of New Buyer Employees with Seller (and its
predecessors, to the extent such service is credited by Seller) for purposes
of eligibility and vesting and level of benefits (but not for benefit accrual
under a defined benefit pension plan or vesting under equity incentive plans
(other than vesting triggered by an individuals retirement)) to the same
extent such service was recognized under similar plans maintained by Seller
immediately prior to the Closing Date, except as would result in a
duplication of benefit; and such service also shall apply for purposes of
satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the
application of any pre-existing condition limitations;

(ii) each Buyer Plan to waive pre-existing condition limitations to the
same extent waived or no longer applicable under the applicable Business
Benefit Plan;

 

(iii) each New Buyer Employee to be given credit under the applicable Buyer
Plan for amounts paid under a corresponding Business Benefit Plan during the
plan year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of applying deductibles,
co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums; and

 

(iv) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall maintain
in effect for the twelve (12) month period following the Closing a severance
plan covering New Buyer Employees, which plan shall provide for severance
payments and benefits to each New Buyer Employee no less favorable than those
Seller provided to such New Buyer Employee pursuant to any Business Benefit
Plan in effect as of immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) _Bonus Amounts_. Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its affiliates to,
pay the (i) "non-contingent retention bonuses" set forth on a schedule 9.3(c)
that Seller shall provide to Buyer on or prior to the date hereof ("Non-
Contingent Bonuses") and (ii) 2017 Bonuses, in each case, to the extent
earned by an applicable New Buyer Employee.

 

(d) _Flexible Spending Accounts_. Effective as of the last day of the
month in which Closing occurs, New Buyer Employees shall no longer be
eligible to contribute to the flexible spending account sponsored by Seller
except as otherwise provided by and in accordance with COBRA (such accounts,
"Seller FSA" and such participants in the Seller FSA, "FSA Participants").
Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall establish flexible spending
accounts which shall (i) permit immediate participation as of the first day of
the month immediately following Closing for all FSA Participants and (ii)
accept for

 



52  reimbursement any claims related to the calendar year in which the Closing
Date occurs and eligible for reimbursement on the basis of participant
elections initially made under the Seller FSA, which have not been previously
reimbursed by Seller. The salary reduction election of FSA Participants under
the Seller FSA will be continued by Buyer following Closing. Seller shall
provide to Buyer as soon as administratively feasible following the Closing
Date, a schedule setting forth the FSA Participants and the amount each FSA
Participant has elected to contribute to the Seller FSA for the current
calendar year and the amount reimbursed by the Seller FSA to the FSA
Participant (or eligible dependent) (the "FSA Balances"). To the extent the
FSA Balances in the aggregate are positive, Seller shall make a payment to
Buyer equal to the aggregate FSA Balances by the tenth (10th) Business Day
following the date on which Seller provides such schedule to Buyer. To the
extent the FSA Balances in the aggregate are negative, Buyer shall make a
payment to Seller equal to the aggregate FSA Balances by the tenth (10th)
Business Day following the date on which Seller provides such schedule to
Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person who elects COBRA continuation
coverage with respect to such Persons flexible spending account shall be
considered a FSA Participant and any such Persons flexible spending account
balance shall not be a FSA Balance.

(e) _U.S. WARN Act_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
provide Buyer with a list of all employees of the Commercial Business who have
experienced an employment loss within the meaning of WARN within the ninety
(90) day period ending on the Closing Date. Buyer shall not, for a period
of ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, engage in any conduct which would
result in an employment loss or layoff for a sufficient number of employees of
Buyer which, if aggregated with any such conduct on the part of Seller prior
to the Closing Date, would result in liability under WARN on the part of
Seller.

 

(f) _COBRA_. Seller shall retain or assume responsibility for, and shall
be responsible for administering compliance with, the continuation coverage
requirements for "group health plans" under Title X of the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA") and any other
similar applicable Law with respect to New Buyer Employees and their covered
dependents who incur a COBRA qualifying event or loss of coverage under any
Business Benefit Plan at any time on or before the Closing Date and with
respect to any current or former employee of Seller that is not a New Buyer
Employee. Buyer shall assume responsibility for, and shall be responsible for
administering compliance with, the continuation coverage requirements under
COBRA and any other similar applicable Law with respect to New Buyer
Employees and their covered dependents who incur a COBRA qualifying event or
loss of coverage after the Closing Date.

 

(g) _No Rights Created_. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed
to create any right, or accelerate entitlement, to any compensation or
benefit whatsoever on the part of any future, present, or former employee of
Seller under any Employee Benefit Plan or otherwise. Except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Buyer,
at any time after the Closing Date, from amending, merging, modifying,
terminating, eliminating, reducing, or otherwise altering in any respect any
Buyer Plan, any benefit under any Buyer Plan or any trust, insurance policy
or funding vehicle related to any Buyer Plan.

 



53 9.4 _Shire Milestone Payment_.

 

(a) If, prior to the Closing Date, Seller achieves, solely with respect to
ONIVYDE (solely as it exists as of the date of this Agreement), (i) the
milestone under _Section 8.2(a)(iv)_ of the License and Collaboration
Agreement, (ii) solely with respect to the First Indication (as defined in the
License and Collaboration Agreement), the milestone under _Section
8.3(a)(iii)_ of the License and Collaboration Agreement (the "Specified
Milestone Payment") or (iii) solely with respect to the First Indication (as
defined in the License and Collaboration Agreement), the milestone under
_Section 8.3(a)(vii)_ of the License and Collaboration Agreement and, in each
case (i), (ii) and (iii), any milestone payment (each, a "Shire Milestone
Payment" and collectively, the "Shire Milestone Payments") becomes payable by
Shire to Seller with respect thereto, such payment shall be paid directly to
Seller, such Shire Milestone Payment shall under no circumstances be
considered part of the Acquired Assets, and Buyer shall not be entitled to
(and shall not be entitled to request) any consideration or right of set off
against the Upfront Payment or the Contingent Consideration in exchange for
its agreement under this _Section 9.4(a)_.

 

(b) After the Closing, in the event any Shire Milestone Payment becomes
payable and Shire has notified Buyer of such achievement pursuant to Section
8.3(c) of the License and Collaboration Agreement, Buyer shall: (i) provide
notice to Seller promptly, and in any event no later than five (5) Business
Days, after receiving such notice from Shire; and (ii) provide Shire (with a
copy provided to Seller) with the corresponding invoice pursuant to Section
8.3(c) of the License and Collaboration Agreement directing Shire to pay
either (x) such Shire Milestone Payment directly to Seller, if such Shire
Milestone Payment is not the Specified Milestone Payment or (y) if such Shire
Milestone Payment is the Specified Milestone Payment, then (A) such Shire
Milestone Payment, less the Reimbursement Amount, directly to Seller and (B)
the Reimbursement Amount directly to Buyer. If Shire fails to comply with such
direction and instead pays all of such Shire Milestone Payment to Buyer, Buyer
shall promptly pay to Seller (and in any event no later than ten (10)
Business Days after receiving such payment) the amount of such Shire Milestone
Payment, less the Reimbursement Amount if such Shire Milestone Payment is the
Specified Milestone Payment. For the avoidance of doubt, except to the extent
of the Reimbursement Amount paid to or retained by Buyer pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.4_ (if any), (1) Buyer and its affiliates shall be mere
collection agents with respect to any Shire Milestone Payment, (2) Seller
shall retain beneficial ownership of any Shire Milestone Payment, (3) no
Shire Milestone Payment shall under any circumstances be considered part of
the Acquired Assets, and (4) Buyer shall not be entitled to (and shall not be
entitled to request) any consideration or right of set off against any
Contingent Consideration in exchange for its agreement under this _Section_ __
_ 9.4_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (x) Seller shall be
solely responsible for, and shall fully and timely pay without any offset to
PharmaEngine, Inc., all payments related to any Shire Milestone Payment or the
related milestone under the PharmaEngine Agreement (the "PharmaEngine
Payments"), and (y) if Seller receives the Specified Milestone Payment at any
time (whether on, before or after the Closing), Seller shall promptly, but in
no case later than two (2) Business Days following receipt of the Specified
Milestone Payment (or the Closing Date if received prior to the Closing), pay
Buyer an amount equal to $9,000,000 (the "Reimbursement Amount") if Buyer has
not already

 



54  received the Reimbursement Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall the Reimbursement Amount be paid to Buyer (A) more than once or (B)
other than with respect to the Specified Milestone Payment. Neither Buyer
nor Seller shall take any position for Tax purposes that is inconsistent with
this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ unless required to do so by applicable Law.

 

(d) After the Closing, Buyer shall not amend or waive any provision of the
License and Collaboration Agreement that adversely affects the Shire
Milestone Payments, including changing the amount or timing of payment of
either of the Shire Milestone Payments without Sellers prior written consent,
which Seller may provide or withhold in its sole and absolute discretion. In
the event Buyer and Shire enter into any discussions to amend the License and
Collaboration Agreement in any manner that adversely affects the Shire
Milestone Payment, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of such discussions.
Buyer shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Seller any
relevant correspondence with Shire regarding any amendments or waivers to the
License and Collaboration Agreement and give Seller a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon, subject to Seller entering into a
confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to Shire and Buyer.

 

9.5 _Use of Names_. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Closing and in no event later than six (6) months after the Closing Date,
Seller shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cease to use the names set forth on _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter and any name confusingly similar thereto
(collectively, the "Restricted Names") and any trademarks, trade names, trade
dress, service marks and logos that use or incorporate any Restricted Name.
Seller agrees that from and after the Closing Seller shall not have any
right, title, interest, license or other right whatsoever in the Restricted
Names. Following the expiration of such six (6) month period, Seller shall,
and shall cause its affiliates to, remove, strike over or obliterate all
Restricted Names and any trademarks, trade names, trade dress, service marks
and logos that use or incorporate any Restricted Name from the Excluded Assets
(it being understood that this requirement shall not apply to fair use of
any Restricted Name, including, but not limited to, in documents and
materials kept as records that are maintained for internal use only and not
publicly disseminated, or to be archived as such records, for historical
purposes or as required by applicable Law). Any use of the Restricted Names
by Seller as permitted in this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ is subject to its use of
each Restricted Name in the same form and manner as, to the same extent as
(without an increase in extent or type of uses of each Restricted Name) and
subject to the same standards of quality that are in effect for each
Restricted Name as of the Closing Date. All goodwill arising from any such use
shall inure to the benefit of Buyer or an applicable Buyer affiliate owning
the Restricted Name so used. Seller shall not to use any Restricted Name in
any manner that may reflect negatively on such name and mark or on Buyer or
any of its affiliates.

 

9.6 _Seller Trademarks_. Buyer agrees that, except as set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.6_, following the Closing Date, Buyer shall not have any
right, title, interest, license or other right whatsoever in the trademarks
set forth on _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the
"Seller Trademarks"), and that Seller has not assigned or otherwise
transferred such right, title, interest, license or other right to Buyer by
implication or otherwise. Upon and following the Closing Date, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cease using any Seller Trademarks in
connection with the Acquired Assets as soon as reasonably practicable and in
no event later than six (6) months after the Closing Date, except that Seller,
on behalf of itself and its affiliates,

 



55  hereby grants to Buyer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-
sublicensable, royalty-free license for a period of no longer than six (6)
months following the Closing Date, to continue to use the Seller Trademarks
solely in connection with the Acquired Assets, solely as, to the extent, and
in the manner such Seller Trademarks were used by Seller immediately prior to
the Closing Date. Following the expiration of such period, Buyer shall remove,
strike over, or otherwise obliterate all Seller Trademarks remaining on any
materials, goods or other property (including in electronic form) in its or
their possession that are publicly accessible or disseminated, including from
all sales and product literature, vehicles, business cards, schedules,
stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional materials,
manuals, forms, websites, email addresses, computer software and other
materials and systems (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) any

10.3 _Press Releases and Announcements_. Each Party shall consult with the
other Party and give the other Party a reasonable opportunity to comment on
such Partys press release announcing the execution and delivery of this
Agreement. No Party shall issue (and each Party shall cause its affiliates not
to issue) any press release or public disclosure relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, or its terms, without the prior written approval of
the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
10.3_ shall prevent any Party from (a) making any public disclosure it
believes in good faith is required by Law, regulation or stock exchange rule
(in which case the disclosing Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to advise the other Party prior to making disclosure and the other
Party shall have the right to review such press release or announcement prior
to its publication) or (b) enforcing its rights hereunder.

 

10.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided by applicable Law,
this Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person
(including with respect to any employee or former employee of Seller, Buyer or
any of its affiliates, any New Buyer Employees and any Business Employees, any
right to employment or contractual employment for any specified period) other
than each Party and its respective successors and permitted assigns and, to
the extent specified herein, its respective affiliates; _provided_ , _however_
, that the provisions of _Article VI_ are intended for the benefit of the
entities and individuals specified therein and their respective legal
representatives, successors and assigns. No provision of this Agreement shall
be deemed to be the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit
plan, as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or otherwise to limit
the right of Buyer or Seller to amend, modify or terminate any such employee
benefit plan.

 



70 10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents referred
to herein), the Related Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
subject matters hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements
(except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended hereby so
that until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.1_, Buyer shall be permitted to take the actions contemplated by this
Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties or
any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

10.6 _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each of the Parties named
herein and its respective successors and permitted assigns. No Party may
assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations
hereunder (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Party; _provided_ , that Buyer may assign the
right to acquire certain of the Acquired Assets to one or more of its
affiliates prior to the Closing (provided that in connection with any
such assignment, Buyer shall remain primarily liable for such assigned
obligations); _provided_ , _however_ , following the Closing, Buyer may assign
and delegate, in whole or in part, its rights and obligations hereunder to
either (i) a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Buyer or (ii) an affiliate under
common control with Buyer; and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that no
such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any obligation or liability under this
Agreement.

 

10.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but both of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement may be
executed and delivered by e-mail of a .pdf, .tif, .jpeg or similar attachment
("Electronic Delivery"), and any such counterparty delivered using Electronic
Delivery shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed
counterpart and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as
if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.

10.8 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement
shall, except to the extent expressly provided to be oral, be in writing and
shall be deemed duly delivered, given and received as follows: (a) if sent by
registered or certified mail in the United States return receipt requested,
upon receipt; (b) if sent designated for overnight delivery by nationally
recognized overnight air courier (such as DHL or Federal Express), upon
receipt of proof of delivery; (c) if sent by e-mail of a .pdf, .tif, .gif,

10.9 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the
application of the Law of any other state. Each of the Parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or,
if such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the federal court of
the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate
court from any thereof, in any suit, action, legal proceeding or claim
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any
such suit, action, legal proceeding or claim except in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware, or, if such court finds it lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, (ii) agrees that any claim
in respect of any such suit, action, 

 



72  legal proceeding or claim may be heard and determined in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if such court finds it lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, the federal court of the United States of America
sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, (iii) waives,
to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action,
legal proceeding or claim in such courts and (iv) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such suit, action, legal proceeding or claim in such courts.
Each of the Parties hereto (A) agrees that a final judgment in any such suit,
action, legal proceeding or claim shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law and (B) waives any objection to the recognition and enforcement by a
court in other jurisdictions of any such final judgment. Each Party to this
Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process inside or outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section_ __ _
10.9_ in the manner provided for notices in _Section_ __ _ 10.8_. Nothing in
this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

10.10 _Amendments and Waivers_. The Parties may mutually amend or
waive any provision of this Agreement at any time. No amendment or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in
writing and signed by each of the Parties. No waiver by either Party of any
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or
subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.

 

10.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in
any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the body making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision
with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the
expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

 

10.12 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided to the
contrary in this Agreement or any of the Related Agreements, each of the
Parties shall bear its own costs and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether or not the Closing takes place, except that
Seller and Buyer shall each bear 50% of (a) any expenses incurred in
connection with any documentary, sales, use, real property transfer, real
property gains, registration, value-added, transfer, stamp, recording and
other similar Taxes; and (b) any fees of the Escrow Agent for the provision
of services under the Escrow Agreement.

 



73 10.13 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the
other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached or are threatened to be breached, and that money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such
damages. It is accordingly agreed that prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, (i) the Parties shall be
entitled to seek (in a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 10.9_) an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including Buyers obligation to effect the Closing), without bond
or other security being required, this being in addition to any remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (ii) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without that right, neither Seller nor Buyer would have entered
into this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is
explicitly agreed that Seller shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable remedy to specifically enforce Buyers
obligation to effect the Closing on the terms and conditions set forth herein
in the event that all conditions in _Sections 5.1_ and _5.2_ have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which is then capable of
being satisfied at a Closing on such date) at the time when the Closing would
have occurred but for the failure of Buyer to comply with its obligations to
effect the Closing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Each of Seller and
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that following a valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, each Party shall be
entitled to seek monetary damages for a willful or intentional breach of this
Agreement. In no event shall any Party be responsible and liable for any
monetary damages or other amounts under this _Section_ __ _ 10.13_ that are
special, exemplary or punitive damages.

 

10.14 _Construction_. Except where expressly stated otherwise in this
Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement: (a)
"either" and "or" are not exclusive and "include", "includes" and "including"
are not limiting; (b) "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement;
(c) the word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning as the word
"shall"; (d) "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which
a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not mean simply "if";
(e) definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms; (f) references to any Law, Contract,
instrument or other document shall mean such Law, Contract, instrument or
other document as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to
time, including by succession of comparable successor Laws; (g) references to
a person or entity are also to its permitted successors and assigns; (h)
references to an "Article", "Section", "Exhibit", "Annex" or "Schedule" refer
to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit, Annex or Schedule to, this
Agreement; (i) references to "$" or otherwise to dollar amounts refer to the
lawful currency of the United States; (j) unless the context so requires,
references to any Laws or specific provisions of Laws shall include any rules,
regulations and delegated legislation issued thereunder; (k) references to
any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter
forms; and (l) the table of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement
are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not affect or be
deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or
any term or provision hereof. Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of
days, such number

 



74  shall refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified, and if any
action is to be taken or given on or by a particular calendar day, and such
calendar day is not a Business Day, then such action may be deferred until
the next Business Day. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
be the language chosen by the Parties hereto to express their mutual intent,
and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against either Party. The
Parties agree that they have been represented by counsel during the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the
application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against
the Party drafting such agreement or document.

 

10.15 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
