term business strategy of Crown, and in the best interests of Crown and its
stockholders, and has approved this Agreement and the other Transaction

defined below) and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
declared their advisability and (ii) has recommended that the stockholders of
Crown approve the issuance of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of

WHEREAS, the sole member of Merger Sub has determined that the Merger is in
the best interests of Merger Sub and its sole member and has approved this

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL and the DLLC Act, at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2), Global shall be merged with and
into Merger Sub. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence
of Global shall cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the Surviving Company
following the Merger. The existence of Merger Sub shall continue unaffected
and unimpaired by the Merger and, as the Surviving Company, it shall be
governed by the Laws (as defined in Section 3.4) of the State of Delaware. At
the option of Crown and in lieu of the otherwise applicable provisions of this
Section 1.1, the Merger will consist of the merger of Merger Sub with and
into Global, with Global as the Surviving Company; _provided_ that Crown shall
not be entitled to exercise such right to the extent that it would result in
the failure to be satisfied of the conditions set forth in either Section
6.2(d) or Section 6.3(d). In the event that Crown makes such an election, the
parties shall discuss in good faith appropriate amendments to this Agreement
and the other agreements contained herein to give effect to such change. 



 

2 Section 1.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. As promptly as practicable (and in any
event within three (3) business days) after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI hereof (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (as defined below)), the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and by making all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL or the DLLC Act in connection with the Merger, in
such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of, the DGCL or the DLLC Act, as applicable. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as the
parties hereto agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger
(the date and time the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_ ").
On the date of such filing, a closing (the " _Closing_ ") shall be held at
10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825
Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10019, or at such other time and location as the
parties hereto shall otherwise agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

Section 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the
DLLC Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Global and Merger Sub
shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of Global and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Surviving Company. 

Section 1.4 _Certificate of Formation and Operating Agreement_.

(a) The Certificate of Formation of Merger Sub in effect immediately preceding
the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Formation of the
Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law.

(b) The Limited Liability Company Agreement of Merger Sub in effect
immediately preceding the Effective Time shall be the Limited Liability
Company Agreement of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended
or as provided therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.5 _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, until the earlier
of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with the Limited Liability
Company Agreement of Merger Sub, the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective
Time, if any, shall be the officers of the Surviving Company.



 

3 ARTICLE II

_CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES_

Section 2.1 _Effect on Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Crown, Merger Sub, Global or the
holders of any of the following securities:

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE II, each share of Global
Common Stock, other than any such share that is a Global Restricted Share (as
defined in Section 3.2(a)) as of the Effective Time and that does not become
fully vested and nonforfeitable at the Effective Time in accordance with the
terms of the applicable award agreement (collectively, the " _Shares_ "),
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any Shares cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(b)), shall automatically be
converted into and represent the right to receive, at the election of the
holder thereof, one of the following (the " _Merger Consideration_ "): (i)
for each Share with respect to which an election to receive stock has been
made effectively and not revoked or deemed to have been made in accordance
with Section 2.1(d) (a " _Stock Election_ "), 1.61 shares of Crown Common
Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ "); and (ii) for each Share with respect to
which an election to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked
pursuant to Section 2.1(d) (a " _Cash Election_ "), $55.95 in cash, subject
to Section 2.1(d)(v) (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), in each case payable
without interest to the holder of such Share upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 2.4, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share
(each, a " _Certificate_ ").

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of Global and each Share owned directly by
Crown or Merger Sub, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be canceled without any conversion thereof, and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each limited liability company interest in Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub
Units_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain outstanding and unaffected by the Merger and, following the
Merger, shall constitute the only outstanding limited liability company
interests or other equity interests in the Surviving Company from and after
the Effective Time.

(d) _Election of Merger Consideration_.

(i) Each person who, on or prior to the Election Date (as defined in Section
2.1(d)(ii)), is a record holder of Shares shall be entitled, with respect to
all or any portion of such holders Shares, to make a Stock Election or Cash
Election on the basis set forth in this Section 2.1(d). For the avoidance of
doubt, a holder of Shares shall be permitted to make a Stock Election with
respect to a portion of such holders Shares and make a Cash Election with
respect to such holders other Shares. If such a holder does not make a Stock
Election or a Cash Election with respect to all or any portion of such
holders Shares, such holder will be deemed to have made a Stock Election in
the manner herein provided with respect to such Shares.



 

4 (ii) Crown shall prepare and mail, or cause to be prepared and mailed, with
the Joint Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 5.10(a)) (x) a form of
election, which form shall be subject to the reasonable review and comment of
Global (the " _Form of Election_ "), (y) a letter of transmittal (which shall
be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section
2.4(a)) and (z) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal, to the record holders of
Shares as of the record date for the Global Stockholders Meeting (as defined
in Section 5.10(a)). The Form of Election shall be used by each record holder
of Shares to make an election to receive the Stock Consideration, the Cash
Consideration or both for any or all Shares held by such holder. Crown and
Global shall use their reasonable best efforts to make the Form of Election,
letter of transmittal and instructions available to all persons who become
holders of Shares during the period between such record date and the Election
Date. Any such holders election to receive the Stock Consideration, the Cash
Consideration or both shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the third business day immediately preceding the Global
Stockholders Meeting (the " _Election Date_ "), (1) a Form of Election
properly completed and signed, (2) a letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and (3) such
other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, together
with Certificates to which such Form of Election and letter of transmittal
relate, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer
on the books of Global.

(iii) Any stockholder of Global may at any time prior to the Election Date
change his or her election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Election Date accompanied by a
properly completed and signed revised Form of Election. Any Form of Election
may be revoked by the stockholder submitting it to the Exchange Agent only by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent (A) prior to 5:00 p.m., New York
City time on the Election Date or (B) after such time, if and to the extent
that the Exchange Agent is legally required to permit revocations and the
Effective Time shall not have occurred prior to such time. All Forms of
Election shall automatically be revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified in
writing by Crown and Global that the Merger has been abandoned. If a Form of
Election is revoked, the Certificate or Certificates to which such Form of
Election relates shall be promptly returned to the stockholder submitting such
Form of Election to the Exchange Agent.

 

(iv) The determination of the Exchange Agent shall be binding as to whether or
not elections to receive the Stock Consideration or the Cash Consideration
have been properly made, changed or revoked pursuant to this Section 2.1(d)
with respect to Shares and when elections, changes and revocations were
received by it. If the Exchange Agent determines that any election to  



 

5  receive the Cash Consideration was not properly made with respect to Shares,
such shares shall be treated by the Exchange Agent as shares for which a
Stock Election was made in accordance with this Section 2.1(d), and such
shares shall be entitled to receive in the Merger the Stock Consideration. The
Exchange Agent also shall make all computations as to proration contemplated
by Section 2.1(d)(v) (which computation shall be made as soon as practicable
following the Election Date), and absent manifest error any such computation
shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of Shares. The Exchange Agent
may make such rules as are consistent with this Section 2.1(d) for the
implementation of the elections provided for herein as shall be necessary or
desirable fully to effect such elections.

(v) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, the
maximum aggregate amount of Cash Consideration that may be paid by Crown
pursuant to this Agreement shall be $550,000,000 (the " _Cash Consideration
Cap_ "); _provided_ that the Cash Consideration Cap shall be reduced on a
dollar-for-dollar basis to the extent of any cash dividends or other cash
distributions declared or paid by Global or any Global Subsidiary (as defined
in Section 3.2(d)) prior to the Effective Time (other than (x) dividends and
distributions by a direct or indirect wholly owned Global Subsidiary to its
parent (without further distribution) and (y) the regular quarterly dividend
of $0.525 per share of Global Common Stock that is to be paid by Global on or
about October 19, 2006 (the " _Global Third Quarter Dividend_ ")). If the
aggregate amount of cash subject to Cash Elections received by the Exchange
Agent (the " _Requested Cash Amount_ ") exceeds the Cash Consideration Cap,
each holder making a Cash Election shall receive, for each Share with respect
to which a Cash Election has been made, (1) cash in an amount equal to the
product of the Cash Consideration and a fraction, the numerator of which is
the Cash Consideration Cap and the denominator of which is the Requested Cash
Amount (such product, the " _Prorated Cash Amount_ ") and (2) a number of
shares of Crown Common Stock equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is
equal to the Cash Consideration minus the Prorated Cash Amount and the
denominator of which is $34.75.

Section 2.2 _Equity-Based Awards_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each Global Restricted Share that is outstanding
and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any
Global Restricted Share that becomes fully vested and nonforfeitable at the
Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement)
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted, on the same terms and conditions
(including vesting) as applied to such Global Restricted Share immediately
prior to the Effective Time, into the number of restricted shares of Crown
Common Stock (the " _Converted Restricted Shares_ ") that is equal to the
Stock Consideration, _provided_ that all fractional Converted Restricted
Shares to which a single holder would be entitled shall be aggregated.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Global Deferred Share (as defined in Section
3.2(a)) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the  



 

6  Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted, on the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as applied to
such Global Deferred Share immediately prior to the Effective Time, into the
number of deferred shares with respect to Crown Common Stock (the " _Converted
Deferred Shares_ ") that is equal to the Stock Consideration, _provided_
that all fractional Converted Deferred Shares to which a single holder would
be entitled shall be aggregated.

(c) At the Effective Time, Crown shall assume the obligations and succeed to
the rights of Global under Globals Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (as amended
December 21, 2005) (the " _Omnibus Plan_ ") with respect to the Converted
Restricted Shares and Converted Deferred Shares. Crown shall take all action
reasonably necessary or appropriate to have available for issuance or transfer
a sufficient number of shares of Crown Common Stock for delivery with respect
to the Converted Restricted Shares and the settlement of the Converted
Deferred Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, Crown shall either (i)
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other
appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Crown Common Stock
necessary to fulfill Crowns obligations under this Section 2.2 or (ii) assume
the Converted Restricted Shares and Converted Deferred Shares under an
existing equity incentive plan with respect to which a registration statement
on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) is effective.

(d) Global shall ensure that following the Effective Time, no holder of a
Global Restricted Share, Global Deferred Share, Global Option (as defined in
Section 2.3(a)) or Global Warrant (as defined in Section 2.3(b)) (or former
holder thereof) or any current or former participant in the Omnibus Plan or
any other Global Benefit Plan (as defined in Section 3.14(a)) or Global
Benefit Agreement (as defined in Section 3.14(a)) shall have any right
thereunder to acquire any capital stock of Global, any Global Subsidiary or
the Surviving Company or any other equity interest therein (including
"phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights).

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, each of Global and Crown shall cause any
dispositions of Global Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Global Common Stock) or acquisitions of Crown Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Crown Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act (as defined in Section 3.5) with respect to Global or Crown
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 2.3 _Options and Warrants_.

(a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, each option entitling the holder thereof
to purchase a share of Global Common Stock (a " _Global Option_ ") that is
outstanding at such time, whether or not exercisable and whether or not
vested, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted, on the same terms
and conditions as applied to such Global Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, into an option to purchase a number of shares of Crown Common
Stock (a " _Converted Option_ ") (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Global Common Stock
subject to such Global Option as of the Effective Time and (ii) the Stock
Consideration, at an exercise price per share of Crown Common Stock (rounded
up to the nearest  



 

7  whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate
exercise price for the shares of Global Common Stock subject to such
Global Option as of the Effective Time by (B) the aggregate number of shares
of Crown Common Stock subject to such Converted Option after giving effect to
the adjustments in this Section 2.3(a).

(b) _Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each warrant entitling the holder
thereof to purchase a share of Global Common Stock (a " _Global Warrant_ ")
that is outstanding at such time, whether or not exercisable and whether or
not vested, granted under the Warrant Agreement, dated February 13, 2006, by
and between Global and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the "
_Warrant Agreement_ "), shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted, on the same
terms and conditions (including vesting) as applied to such Global Warrant
immediately prior to the Effective Time, into a warrant entitling such holder
thereof to purchase a number of shares of Crown Common Stock (a " _Converted
Warrant_ ") (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of
(i) the number of shares of Global Common Stock subject to such Global Warrant
as of the Effective Time and (ii) the Stock Consideration, at an exercise
price per share of Crown Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate exercise price
for the shares of Global Common Stock subject to such Global Warrant as of the
Effective Time by (B) the aggregate number of shares of Crown Common Stock
subject to such Converted Warrant after giving effect to the adjustments in
this Section 2.3(b).

Section 2.4 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At the Effective Time, Crown shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company that, prior to the
mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement, may be designated by Crown, and that is
reasonably satisfactory to Global, to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in
accordance with this ARTICLE II through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates
representing the shares of Crown Common Stock issuable as the Stock
Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a),
(ii) cash or a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any
required withholdings pursuant to Section 2.4(i)) equal to the amount of cash
payable as the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and (iii) cash, from time to time as required to
make payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4(e) or
with respect to dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.4(c) (such cash and certificates for shares of Crown Common Stock being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the shares of Crown Common
Stock and cash contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and this
Section 2.4(a) out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Section
2.4(g) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Immediately after the Effective Time, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent, whether prior to or after the Election Date,
of a Certificate for cancellation, together with a letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange  



 

8  therefor: (A) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Crown Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate after taking into account
all Shares then held by such holder, (B) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars
(after giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to Section 2.4(i))
equal to the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) and (C) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Crown Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(e) and any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.4(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
pursuant to Section 2.4(c) or (e). Unless the duly completed and validly
executed letter of transmittal provides otherwise, for all purposes of this
Section 2.4 and in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.358-2(a)(2)(ii), (i) a holder will be treated as having surrendered, in
exchange for the total Cash Consideration, if any, to be paid to such holder
under Section 2.1(d) (with respect to a holder, the " _Cash Portion_ "), the
number of Shares equal to the quotient of (x) such holders Cash Portion,
divided by (y) the Cash Consideration; and (ii) for purposes of clause (i),
the Certificates surrendered by a holder in exchange for such holders Cash
Portion will be deemed to be: (A) first, of those Certificates evidencing
Shares held by such holder for more than one year before the Merger within the
meaning of Section 1223 of the Code, if any, those Certificates with the
highest Federal income Tax basis, in descending order until such Certificates
are exhausted or the Cash Portion for such holder is fully paid, then (B) of
all other of such holders Certificates, those Certificates with the highest
Federal income Tax basis, in descending order until the Cash Portion for such
holder is fully paid. __ In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of Global, the Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled (including, if applicable, a
check for cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Crown Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(e)) and a check for any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.4(c) may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.4, each Certificate shall be deemed at all
times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration, the cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Crown Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.4(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(c).

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to the
Crown Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
Global Common Stock formerly represented thereby, until the holder of
such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of
escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Crown Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect
to such whole shares of Crown Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender  



 

9  and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such
whole shares of Crown Common Stock.

(d) _No Further Rights in Global Common Stock_. All cash paid and shares of
Crown Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with
the terms of this ARTICLE II (including any cash paid pursuant to Section
2.4(c) or (e)) shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or script representing fractional
shares of Crown Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, and such fractional shares interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Crown. Each
holder of Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Crown Common Stock (after taking
into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, upon
surrender of such holders Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.4,
an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) such fractional share interest to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled by (ii) $34.75. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Crown, and
Crown shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the
Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional share
interests subject to and in accordance with the terms of Section 2.4(b).

(f) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any forward or reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Crown Common Stock or Global Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Crown Common Stock or Global Common Stock
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. The
Cash Consideration Cap shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the
extent of any cash dividends or other cash distributions declared or paid by
Global or any Global Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time (other than (x)
dividends and distributions by a direct or indirect wholly owned Global
Subsidiary to its parent (without further distribution) and (y) the Global
Third Quarter Dividend).

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Global Common Stock for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Crown, upon demand, and shall be held in
trust for the benefit of any holders of Global Common Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II without any interest thereon,
subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Law.

(h) _No Liability_. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be
liable to any holder of Certificates for any such Shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate
has not been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration or any
dividends or distributions with respect to Crown Common Stock as contemplated
by Section 2.4(c) in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any  



 

10  Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.5)), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Company, Crown and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of federal, state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Crown
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Shares in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made by
Crown or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Crown, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Crown may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Crown Common Stock to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(e) and any dividend or
other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.4(c).

(k) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Crown, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Crown.

Section 2.5 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of Global shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of Global. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or Crown for any reason shall be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Crown Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.4(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(c).

Subsidiary or (iii) that give any person the right to receive any economic
benefit or right similar to or derived from the economic benefits and rights
accruing to holders of capital stock Global or any Global Subsidiary (each of
(i), (ii) and (iii), collectively, the " _Global Stock Rights_ "). All
outstanding shares of Global Common Stock are, and all shares of Global Common
Stock that may be issued prior to the Effective Time will be when issued,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations of Global or any Global Subsidiary to  



 

13  repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock or equity interest
of Global (including any shares of Global Common Stock) or any Global
Subsidiary or any Global Stock Rights or to pay any dividend or make any
other distribution in respect thereof or to provide funds to, or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any
person.

(c) Section 3.2(c) of the Global Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, complete
and correct list, as of September 29, 2006, of (i) all Global Options, the
number of shares of Global Common Stock subject thereto, the grant dates,
expiration dates, the exercise or base prices and vesting schedules thereof
and the names of the holders thereof, (ii) all outstanding Global Warrants,
the number of shares of Global Common Stock subject thereto, the grant dates,
expiration dates, the exercise or base prices and vesting schedules thereof
and the names of the holders thereof, (iii) all outstanding Global
Restricted Shares, the grant dates, vesting schedules, repurchase prices (if
any) and names of the holders thereof and (iv) all outstanding Global Deferred
Shares, the maximum number of shares of Global Common Stock that may be issued
pursuant to each such Global Deferred Share, the grant dates, vesting
schedules and names of the holders thereof. Each outstanding Global Restricted
Share, Global Deferred Share, Global Option and Global Warrant may, pursuant
to its terms, be treated at the Effective Time as set forth in Section 2.2 or
2.3, as applicable.

(d) Exhibit 21.1 to Globals Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2005 includes all the Subsidiaries of Global (each a "
_Global Subsidiary_ " and together, the " _Global Subsidiaries_ ") in
existence as of the date hereof. All the outstanding shares of capital stock
of, or other equity interests in, each such Global Subsidiary have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are,
except as set forth in such Exhibit 21.1, owned directly or indirectly by
Global, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances
and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "
_Liens_ ") and free of any other restriction (including any restriction on
the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other
ownership interests), except for restrictions imposed by applicable securities
laws. Neither Global nor any of the Global Subsidiaries directly or
indirectly owns or has any right or obligation to subscribe for or otherwise
acquire any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for, any corporation, partnership, joint venture
or other business association or entity (other than the Global Subsidiaries).

Section 3.3 _Authority for Agreement_.

(a) Global has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject
to obtaining the Global Stockholder Approval (as defined below) in connection
with this Agreement and the Merger, to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution, delivery and
performance by Global of this Agreement and the consummation by Global of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Global and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Global are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than obtaining the Global Stockholder
Approval and the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as
required by the DGCL and the DLLC Act). This Agreement has been duly executed
and  



 

14  delivered by Global and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by Crown and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Global enforceable against Global in accordance with its terms
subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the rights and remedies
of creditors generally and to the effect of general principles of equity. The
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Global Common
Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL, the Global Certificate of
Incorporation and the Global Bylaws (the " _Global Stockholder Approval_ ")
is the only vote of the holders of capital stock of Global necessary to adopt
and approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(b) The Global Board, at a meeting duly called and held, duly and unanimously
adopted resolutions (i) approving this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) determining that the terms of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to and in the best
interests of Global and its stockholders, (iii) recommending that Globals
stockholders adopt this Agreement and (iv) declaring that this Agreement is
advisable. Such resolutions are sufficient to render inapplicable to Crown and
Merger Sub, this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the other Transaction Agreements and the
transactions contemplated thereby, the restrictions set forth in Article IV,
Part D of the Global Certificate of Incorporation. The provisions of Section
203 of the DGCL are inapplicable to Crown and Merger Sub, this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by virtue of
the express election of Global set forth in the Global Certificate of
Incorporation not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL. To Globals
knowledge, no other state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
applies or purports to apply to Global with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby.

(c) Goldman, Sachs and Co., the financial advisor to the Global Board (the "
_Global Financial Advisor_ "), has delivered to the Global Board its opinion
to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based on the
assumptions, qualifications and limitations contained therein, the Merger
Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Global Common Stock. Global has made available to Crown, for informational
purposes only, a correct and complete copy of the form of such opinion prior
to the execution of this Agreement.

Section 3.4  _No Conflict_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Global do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Global and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, (a) assuming the Global Stockholder Approval is obtained,
conflict with or violate (i) the Global Certificate of Incorporation or the
Global Bylaws or (ii) the equivalent organizational documents of any of the
Global Subsidiaries, (b) subject to Section 3.5 and assuming the Global
Stockholder Approval is obtained, conflict with or violate any United States
federal, state or local or any foreign statute, law, rule, regulation,
ordinance, code or any other requirement or rule of law (a " _Law_ ") or any
charge, order, writ, injunction, judgment, decree, ruling, determination,
directive, award or settlement, whether civil, criminal or administrative (an
" _Order_ "), in each case applicable to Global or any of the Global
Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of Global or any of  



 

15  the Global Subsidiaries is bound or affected, or (c) result in a breach of
or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time
or both would become a default) under, give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, result in the
triggering of any payment or other obligation or any right of consent, or
result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of Global or any of
the Global Subsidiaries pursuant to any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Global or any of the Global Subsidiaries is a party or by
which Global or any of the Global Subsidiaries or any property or asset of any
of them is bound or affected (including any Global Material Contract (as
defined in Section 3.12(a)), except, in the case of clauses (a)(ii), (b) and
(c) above, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences which have not had and are not reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.5 _Required Filings and Consents_. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Global do not, and the performance of this Agreement
by Global will not, require any consent, approval, order, authorization or
permit of, or declaration, registration, filing with, or notification to, any
United States federal, state or local or any foreign government or any court,
administrative or regulatory agency or commission or other governmental
authority or agency, domestic or foreign (a " _Governmental Entity_ "), except
for (i) applicable requirements, if any, of (A) the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), including, without limitation, the filing
with the SEC of the Joint Proxy Statement and of the Registration Statement
(as defined in Section 5.10(a)) in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus, and declaration of effectiveness of the Registration
Statement, (B) state securities or "blue sky" laws, (C) the DGCL and the DLLC
Act to file the Certificate of Merger or other appropriate documentation and
(D) the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), (ii) those required by the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR
Act_ "), (iii) such filings and approvals as are required to be made or
obtained under any foreign antitrust, competition or similar Laws in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) the filing of customary applications and
notices, as applicable, (A) with the Federal Aviation Administration (the "
_FAA_ "), and any approvals of such applications and notices, or (B) with the
Federal Communications Commission (the " _FCC_ ") under the Communications Act
of 1934, as amended (the " _Communications Act_ "), and any approvals of such
applications and notices, which, in the case of this clause (iv), are required
or appropriate with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and related to Globals ownership or operation of communications or broadcast
towers and the assets and properties relating thereto and (v) customary
filings, notices and approvals with any state public service, public utility
commissions, state environmental agencies or similar state regulatory bodies
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related
to the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as a result of Globals ownership or operation of
communications or broadcast towers and the assets and properties relating
thereto.

Section 3.6 _Compliance; Regulatory Compliance_.

(a) Each of Global and the Global Subsidiaries (i) has been operated at all
times in compliance with all Laws applicable to Global or any of the Global
Subsidiaries or by  



 

16  which any property, business or asset of Global or any of the Global
Subsidiaries is bound or affected and (ii) is not in default or violation of
any governmental licenses, permits or franchises to which Global or any of
the Global Subsidiaries is a party or by which Global or any of the Global
Subsidiaries or any property or asset of Global or any of the Global
Subsidiaries is bound or affected other than, in the case of clauses (i) and
(ii) above, failures to comply, defaults or violations which do not have and
are not reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Global nor any Global Subsidiary has
received any written communication during the past two years from a
Governmental Entity that alleges that Global or a Global Subsidiary is not in
compliance with any applicable Law, except for failures to be in
compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each of Global and the Global Subsidiaries has in effect all required
governmental licenses, permits, certificates, approvals and authorizations
necessary for the conduct of their business and the use of their properties
and assets, as presently conducted and used, except where such failure has
not had, or is not reasonably expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; and neither Global nor any Global
Subsidiary has received notice from any Governmental Entity that any such
license, permit, certificate, approval or authorization is subject to any
adverse action which has had, or is reasonably expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) This Section 3.6 does not relate to Tax matters, employee benefits
matters, labor relations matters, environmental matters,
intellectual property matters or matters related to the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and international trade sanctions, which are the subjects of
Sections 3.9, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16, 3.17 and 3.21, respectively.

Section 3.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

(a) Each of Global and the Global Subsidiaries has filed all forms, reports,
statements and documents required to be filed with the SEC since June 2, 2004
(the " _Global SEC Reports_ "), each of which has complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
each as in effect on the date so filed, except to the extent updated, amended,
restated or corrected by a subsequent Global SEC Report filed or furnished to
the SEC by Global, and in either case, publicly available prior to the date
hereof (each, a " _Global Filed SEC Report_ "). None of the Global SEC Reports
(including any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by
reference therein) contained when filed or currently contains, and any Global
SEC Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not contain,
any untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent Global
Filed SEC Report.

(b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent Global Filed SEC Report, all of the financial statements included
in the Global SEC  



 

17  Reports, in each case, including any related notes thereto, as filed with
the SEC (those filed with the SEC are collectively referred to as the "
_Global Financial Statements_ "), comply as to form in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules of the SEC
with respect thereto and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case of the unaudited statements, as may be permitted by
Form 10-Q of the SEC and subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to
normal, year-end audit adjustments which are not reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect). The condensed
consolidated balance sheets (including the related notes) included in such
Global Financial Statements (if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or
corrected in a subsequent Global Filed SEC Report) fairly present, in all
material respects, the condensed consolidated financial position of Global
and the Global Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof, and the condensed
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows (in
each case, including the related notes) included in such Global Financial
Statements (if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or corrected in a
subsequent Global Filed SEC Report) fairly present, in all material respects,
the condensed consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and
cash flows of Global and the Global Subsidiaries for the periods indicated,
subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, year-end
adjustments which are not reasonably expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Neither Global nor any of the Global Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any kind whatsoever, whether or not accrued and whether or not
contingent or absolute, that are material to Global and the Global
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than (i) liabilities or obligations
disclosed or provided for in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet of Global as of June 30, 2006, including the notes thereto, contained in
the Global SEC Reports, (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred on behalf of
Global in connection with this Agreement and the contemplated Merger, (iii)
liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since June 30, 2006, and (iv) other liabilities
or obligations that are otherwise covered by insurance. 

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of Global and the principal
financial officer of Global (or each former principal executive officer of
Global and each former principal financial officer of Global, as applicable)
has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect
to the Global SEC Reports, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the
meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither Global nor
any of the Global Subsidiaries has any outstanding, or has arranged any
outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within
the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(i) Global maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of  



 

18  management and (C) regarding prevention or timely detection of the
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Globals assets.

(ii) Globals "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by Global in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Globals management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Global required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(iii) Neither Global nor any of the Global Subsidiaries is a party to, or has
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Global or any of
the Global Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Global or any of
the Global Subsidiaries in Globals or such Global Subsidiarys published
financial statements or other Global SEC Reports.

(iv) Since June 2, 2004, Global has not received any oral or written
notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" or (y) "material weakness"
in Globals internal controls over financial reporting. There is no
outstanding "significant deficiency" or "material weakness" which Globals
independent accountants certify has not been appropriately and adequately
remedied by Global. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant
deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them
in Release 2004-001 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in
effect on the date hereof.

(e) The effectiveness of any additional SEC disclosure requirement that, as
of the date of this Agreement, has been formally proposed that is not yet in
effect, is not expected by Global to lead to any materially adverse change in
Globals disclosures as set forth in the Global SEC Reports.

(f) None of the Global Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since June 2, 2004
been, subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of
the Exchange Act.

Section 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as contemplated by
this Agreement, since the date of the most recent audited financial
statements included in the Global SEC Reports and through the date hereof,
each of Global and the Global Subsidiaries has conducted its respective
businesses only in the ordinary course in all material respects and in a
manner consistent with prior practice in all material respects and there has
not been any event or  



 

19  occurrence of any condition that has had or is reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except
as contemplated by this Agreement, since the date of the most recent audited
financial statements included in the Global SEC Reports and through the date
hereof, there has not been (i) any material change in accounting methods,
principles or practices employed by Global or (ii) any action of the types
described in Section 5.1(b) or Section 5.1(c) which, had such action been
taken after the date of this Agreement, would be in violation of any such
Section.

Section 3.9 _Taxes_.

(a) Each of Global and the Global Subsidiaries has duly filed all Tax Returns
(as defined in Section 3.9(j)), required to be filed by it or has been granted
extensions to file such Tax Returns, which extensions have not expired, and
all such Tax Returns are true, complete and accurate, except to the extent
that all such failures to file, taken together, have not had and are not
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Global and each of the
Global Subsidiaries have paid (or Global has paid on its behalf) all Taxes
(i) shown as due on such Tax Returns or (ii) otherwise due and payable, except
for those Taxes (x) being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
and for which adequate reserves have been established in the financial
statements included in the Global SEC Reports in accordance with GAAP or (y)
that have not had and are not reasonably expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. There are no Liens for any Taxes
upon the assets of Global or the Global Subsidiaries, other than (i) statutory
Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable, (ii) Liens for Taxes contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and (iii) Liens that are not, and are
not reasonably expected to be, material to the businesses of Global and the
Global Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) Global (i) for each taxable period beginning with its date of formation
through its most recent taxable year ended on or before the date hereof, has
been subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust within the meaning
of Sections 856 et seq. of the Code (a " _REIT_ ") and has satisfied all the
requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii) has operated consistent
with all the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT through the
date hereof for the period from the end of its most recent taxable year ended
before the date hereof, (iii) has not taken any action or omitted to take any
action that is reasonably expected to result in a successful challenge by the
Internal Revenue Service to its status as a REIT, and no such challenge is
pending, or to Globals knowledge, threatened and (iv) intends to continue to
operate in such a manner as to permit it to continue to qualify as a REIT for
the taxable year or portion thereof that will end with the Merger. Each
Global Subsidiary that files Tax Returns as a partnership or is a disregarded
entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes has since its acquisition by
Global been classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as either a
partnership or disregarded entity and not as an association taxable as a
corporation, or a "publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section
7704(b) of the Code that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income
tax purposes under Section 7704(a) of the Code. Each Global Subsidiary that is
a corporation has been since its formation classified as a qualified REIT
subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code or a taxable REIT subsidiary
under Section 856(l) of the Code (a " _TRS_ "). No Global Subsidiary is
classified as or files Tax Returns as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of
the Code or as a regular "C" Corporation that is not treated as a TRS. Global
has not engaged, directly or indirectly, in any action that resulted in any
"prohibited transaction"  



 

20  Tax pursuant to Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, any Tax on certain non-arms
length transactions pursuant to Section 857(b)(7) of the Code or any Tax
pursuant to Section 4981 of the Code.

(c) Global had at least $280,700,000 of "net operating loss
carryovers" within the meaning of Section 172 of the Code as of December 31,
2005, which are subject to limitations pursuant to Section 382 of the Code as
of the date hereof.

(d) No Tax Return of Global or a Global Subsidiary is or has ever been audited
or examined by any tax authority, and no notice of such an audit
or examination has been received by Global or a Global Subsidiary. No
deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed in writing
against Global or any of the Global Subsidiaries that are not adequately
reserved for, except for deficiencies that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and are not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such taxes have
been granted or are pending (other than with respect to years that are
currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or other
applicable taxing authorities).

(e) Neither Global nor any of the Global Subsidiaries has taken any action or
has any knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to
prevent the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.

(f) Neither Global nor any of the Global Subsidiaries has constituted either
a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A)) in a distribution of stock qualifying for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior
to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could otherwise
constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Merger.

(g) Neither Global nor any of the Global Subsidiaries has entered into a
"listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation §
1.6011-4(b)(2).

(h) Global and the Global Subsidiaries have complied with all applicable Laws
relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes, except where a failure to
comply, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(i) Neither Global nor any of the Global Subsidiaries has any liability for
the Taxes of any person (other than Global and the Global Subsidiaries)
under Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of any state,
local or foreign law) as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

(j) As used in this Agreement (A) " _Tax_ " means any federal, state, local or
foreign income, gross receipts, property, sales, use, value-added, license,
excise, franchise, employment, payroll, premium, withholding, alternative or
added minimum, ad valorem, transfer or excise tax, or any other tax, duty,
governmental fee or other like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever,
together with any related interest, penalty, addition to tax or additional
amount,  



 

21  and any liability for any of the foregoing as transferee, and (B) " _Tax
Return_ " means any report, return, document, declaration or other
information or filing required to be filed with respect to taxes (whether or
not a payment is required to be made with respect to such filing), including
information returns, any documents with respect to or accompanying payments
of estimated taxes, or with respect to or accompanying requests for the
extension of time in which to file any such report, return, document,
declaration or other information.

Section 3.10 _Change of Control Agreement; No Excess Parachute Payment_.

(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
nor compliance with the terms hereof will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) (i) entitle any current or former employee, officer,
director or consultant of Global or any Global Subsidiary (each, a "
_Global Participant_ ") to enhanced severance or termination pay, change in
control or similar payments or benefits, (ii) result in, cause the accelerated
vesting or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or
benefit to any Global Participant, (iii) trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to, or increase the cost of, any Global Benefit Plan or Global Benefit
Agreement or (iv) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under,
any Global Benefit Plan or Global Benefit Agreement. The aggregate amount of
all cash payments that may become payable or be provided to any Global
Participant under the Global Benefit Plans and Global Benefit Agreements
(assuming for such purpose that such individuals employment were terminated
immediately following the Effective Time as if the Effective Time were the
date hereof) will not exceed the amount set forth in Section 3.10(a) of the
Global Disclosure Letter.

(b) Other than payments that may be made to persons set forth on Section
3.10(b) of the Global Disclosure Letter (the " _Primary Company Executives_
"), Global reasonably anticipates no amount or other entitlement that
could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as
a result of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(alone or in combination with any other event) by any Global Participant who
is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Global Benefit Plan, Global Benefit
Agreement or other compensation arrangement would be characterized as an
"excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code), and no such disqualified individual is entitled to receive any
additional payment ( _e.g._ , any Tax gross up or other payment) from Global,
Crown or any other person in the event that the excise Tax required by
Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed on such disqualified individual.
Section 3.10(b) of the Global Disclosure Letter sets forth (i) a complete and
accurate list of Globals reasonable, good faith estimate of the maximum
amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property, and including the amount of any Tax gross up) by each Primary
Company Executive as a result of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event)
under all Global Benefit Agreements and Global Benefit Plans and (ii) the
"base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each Primary
Company Executive, calculated as of the date of this Agreement.

under any Global Benefit Plan or Global Benefit Agreement or under ERISA, the
Code or any other applicable Law; (iv) no Participant has received or is

letter to the effect that such Global Pension Plan currently is qualified and
exempt from income Taxes under Section 401(a) of the Code and the trust
relating to such plan is exempt from income Taxes under Section 501(a) of the
Code, and no such determination letter has been revoked and, to the knowledge
of Global, revocation has not been threatened and, to the knowledge of Global,
no event has occurred since the date of the most recent determination letter
or application therefor relating to any such Global Pension Plan that
is reasonably expected to adversely affect the qualification of such Global
Pension Plan or materially increase the costs relating thereto or require
security under Section 307 of ERISA; (vi) Global has made available to Crown a
copy of the most recent determination letter received with respect to each
Global Pension Plan for which such a letter has been issued, as well as a copy
of any pending application for a determination letter and a complete and

Agreement) that are (pursuant to any such understandings, agreements or
undertakings) reasonably expected to result in any liabilities if such Global
Benefit Plan or Global Benefit Agreement were amended or terminated on or at
any time after the Effective Time or that would prevent any unilateral action
by Global (or, after the Effective Time, Crown) to effect such amendment or
termination; (viii) other than as set forth in any Global Benefit Plans or as
may be required to avoid any adverse Tax consequence under Section 409A of
the Code, since December 31, 2005, there has not been any adoption, entry

Federal, state, local or foreign income, excise or other Taxes (including

thereto.

(d) With respect to each Global Benefit Plan, (i) there has not occurred any
"prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or

their respective officers, directors or employees or, to the knowledge of
Global, any trustee or other fiduciary or administrator of any Global Benefit
Plan or trust created thereunder, in each case, who is not an officer,
director or employee of Global or any Global Subsidiary (a " _Non-Affiliate
Plan Fiduciary_ "), or any agent of the foregoing, has engaged that is
reasonably likely to subject Global, any Global Subsidiary or any of their
respective officers, directors or employees or any Non-Affiliate Plan
Fiduciary, to the Tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section
4975 of the Code or the sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA or any other
applicable Law and (ii) none of Global, any Global Subsidiary or any of their
respective officers, directors or employees, or, to the knowledge of Global,
any Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary, nor any agent of any of the foregoing, has
engaged in any transaction or acted in a manner, or failed to act in a manner,
that is reasonably likely to subject Global, any Global Subsidiary or any of
their respective officers, directors or employees or any Non-Affiliate Plan
Fiduciary to any liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any
other applicable Law. 

(e) Each Global Benefit Plan and each Global Benefit Agreement that is a

applicable securities laws. Neither Crown nor any of the Crown Subsidiaries
directly or indirectly owns or has any right or obligation to subscribe for or
otherwise acquire any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity (other than

Section 4.3 _Authority for Agreement_.

(a) Each of Crown and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate or limited
liability company power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to obtaining the Crown
Stockholder Approval (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance by each of Crown and Merger
Sub of this Agreement, and the consummation by each of Crown and Merger Sub
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability company
action on the part of Crown and Merger Sub, as applicable, and no other
corporate or limited liability company proceedings on the part of Crown or
Merger Sub, as applicable, are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (other than obtaining the Crown Stockholder Approval and the
filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL
and the DLLC Act). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each
of Crown and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by Global, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each
of Crown and Merger Sub enforceable against each of Crown and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
the rights and remedies of creditors generally and to the effect of general
principles of equity. The affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes
cast by the holders of Crown Common Stock at the Crown Stockholders Meeting,
_provided_ that the total votes cast represents over 50% in interest of all
securities entitled to vote, as required by the Listed Company Manual of
the NYSE, is the only vote of the holders of any capital stock of Crown
necessary to approve the Share Issuance (the " _Crown Stockholder Approval_
"). The written consent of Crown, in its capacity as the sole member of Merger
Sub, is the only vote, consent or approval of the holders of Merger Sub Units
necessary to adopt and approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The Crown Board, at a meeting duly called and held duly and unanimously
(with one abstention) adopted resolutions (i) approving this Agreement and
the other Transaction Agreements, the Merger, the Share Issuance and the other
transactions  



 

35  contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) determining that the terms of the
Merger, the Share Issuance and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Crown and its
stockholders and (iii) recommending that Crowns stockholders approve the
Share Issuance. Such resolutions are sufficient to render inapplicable to this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, the Merger, the Share
Issuance and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the acquisition pursuant hereto of shares of Crown Common Stock by the Global
stockholders that are party to the Stockholders Agreement and their
respective Affiliates) the restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined
in Section 203 of the DGCL) set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL. To Crowns
knowledge, no other state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
applies or purports to apply to Crown with respect to this Agreement and other
Transaction Agreements, the Merger, the Share Issuance or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Crown, in its capacity as the sole member of Merger Sub, has approved and
adopted this Agreement and the Merger.

(d) Each of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated
(each a " _Crown Financial Advisor_ ") has delivered to the Crown Board its
opinion to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based on the
assumption, qualifications and limitations contained therein, the Merger
Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to Crown. Crown has
made available to Global, for informational purposes only, correct and
complete copies of the forms of such opinions prior to the execution of this
Agreement.

Section 4.4 _No Conflict_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
each of Crown and Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement by
each of Crown and Merger Sub and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, (a) assuming the Crown
Stockholder Approval is obtained, conflict with or violate (i) the Crown
Certificate of Incorporation or the Crown Bylaws, (ii) the Certificate of
Formation of Merger Sub or the Operating Agreement of Merger Sub or (iii) the
equivalent organizational documents of any of the Crown Subsidiaries, (b)
subject to Section 4.5 and assuming the Crown Stockholder Approval is
obtained, conflict with or violate any Law or any Order, in each case
applicable to Crown or any of the Crown Subsidiaries or by which any property
or asset of Crown or any of the Crown Subsidiaries is bound or affected, or
(c) result in a breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, give to others
any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, result
in the triggering of any payment or other obligation or any right of consent,
or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of Crown or any
of the Crown Subsidiaries pursuant to any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Crown or any of the Crown Subsidiaries is a party or by
which Crown or any of the Crown Subsidiaries or any property or asset of any
of them is bound or affected except, in the case of clauses (a)(iii), (b) and
(c) above, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences which have not had and are not reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.5 _Required Filings and Consents_. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Crown and Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this
Agreement by Crown and Merger Sub will not, require any consent, approval,
order, authorization or permit of, or  



 

36  declaration, registration, filing with, or notification to, any Governmental
Entity, except for (i) applicable requirements, if any, of (A) the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, the filing with the
SEC of the Joint Proxy Statement and of the Registration Statement in which
the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, and declaration
of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, (B) state securities or "blue
sky" laws, (C) the DGCL and the DLLC Act to file the Certificate of Merger or
other appropriate documentation and (D) the NYSE, (ii) those required by the
HSR Act, (iii) such filings and approvals as are required to be made or
obtained under any foreign antitrust, competition or similar Laws in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) the filing of customary applications and
notices, as applicable, (A) with the FAA, and any approvals of such
applications and notices, or (B) with the FCC under the Communications Act,
and any approvals of such applications and notices, which, in the case of
this clause (iv), are required or appropriate with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and related to Crowns ownership or operation
of communications or broadcast towers and the assets and properties relating
thereto and (v) customary filings, notices and approvals with any state public
service, public utility commissions, state environmental agencies or similar
state regulatory bodies with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and related to the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a result of Crowns ownership
or operation of communications or broadcast towers and the assets and
properties relating thereto.

Section 4.6 _Compliance; Regulatory Compliance_.

(a) Each of Crown and the Crown Subsidiaries (i) has been operated at all
times in compliance with all Laws applicable to Crown or any of the
Crown Subsidiaries or by which any property, business or asset of Crown or
any of the Crown Subsidiaries is bound or affected and (ii) is not in default
or violation of any governmental licenses, permits or franchises to which
Crown or any of the Crown Subsidiaries is a party or by which Crown or any of
the Crown Subsidiaries or any property or asset of Crown or any of the Crown
Subsidiaries is bound or affected other than, in the case of clauses (i) and
(ii) above, failures to comply, defaults or violations which do not have and
are not reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Crown nor any Crown Subsidiary has received
any written communication during the past two years from a Governmental
Entity that alleges that Crown or a Crown Subsidiary is not in compliance with
any applicable Law, except for failures to be in compliance that, individually
or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each of Crown and the Crown Subsidiaries has in effect all required
governmental licenses, permits, certificates, approvals and authorizations
necessary for the conduct of their business and the use of their properties
and assets, as presently conducted and used, except where such failure has not
had, or is not reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect; and neither Crown nor any Crown Subsidiary has
received notice from any Governmental Entity that any such license, permit,
certificate, approval or authorization is subject to any adverse action which
has had, or is reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect.



 

37 (c) This Section 4.6 does not relate to Tax matters, environmental matters or
matters related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and international trade
sanctions, which are the subjects of Sections 4.9, 4.13 and 4.16,
respectively.

Section 4.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

(a) Each of Crown and the Crown Subsidiaries has filed all forms,
reports, statements and documents required to be filed with the SEC since
January 1, 2004 (the " _Crown SEC Reports_ "), each of which has complied in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the
date so filed, except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected
by a subsequent Crown SEC Report filed or furnished to the SEC by Crown, and
in either case, publicly available prior to the date hereof (each, a " _Crown
Filed SEC Report_ "). None of the Crown SEC Reports (including any financial
statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein)
contained when filed or currently contains, and any Crown SEC Reports filed
with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not contain, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent Crown Filed SEC
Report.

(b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent Crown Filed SEC Report, all of the financial statements included in
the Crown SEC Reports, in each case, including any related notes thereto, as
filed with the SEC (those filed with the SEC are collectively referred to as
the " _Crown Financial Statements_ "), comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules of
the SEC with respect thereto and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the unaudited statements,
as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and subject, in the case of the
unaudited statements, to normal, year-end audit adjustments which are not
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect). The consolidated balance sheets (including the related
notes) included in such Crown Financial Statements (if applicable, as
updated, amended, restated or corrected in a subsequent Crown Filed SEC
Report) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Crown and the Crown Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof,
and the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash
flows (in each case, including the related notes) included in such Crown
Financial Statements (if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or
corrected in a subsequent Crown Filed SEC Report) fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders
equity and cash flows of Crown and the Crown Subsidiaries for the
periods indicated, subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to
normal, year-end adjustments which are not reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Neither Crown nor any of the Crown Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any kind whatsoever, whether or not accrued and whether or
not contingent or absolute, that are material to Crown and the Crown
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than (i) 



 

38  liabilities or obligations disclosed or provided for in the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of Crown as of June 30, 2006, including the
notes thereto, contained in the Crown SEC Reports, (ii) liabilities or
obligations incurred on behalf of Crown in connection with this Agreement and
the contemplated Merger, (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June 30,
2006, and (iv) other liabilities or obligations that are otherwise covered by
insurance.

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of Crown and the principal
financial officer of Crown (or each former principal executive officer of
Crown and each former principal financial officer of Crown, as applicable)
has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect
to the Crown SEC Reports, and the statements contained in such certifications
are true and accurate. Neither Crown nor any of the Crown Subsidiaries has
any outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to
directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

(i) Crown maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (C) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Crowns assets.

(ii) Crowns "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by Crown in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Crowns management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
Crown required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(iii) Neither Crown nor any of the Crown Subsidiaries is a party to, or has
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Crown or any of
the Crown Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Crown or any of
the Crown Subsidiaries in Crowns or such Crown Subsidiarys published
financial statements or other Crown SEC Reports.



 

39 (iv) Since January 1, 2004, Crown has not received any oral or written
notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" or (y) "material weakness"
in Crowns internal controls over financial reporting. There is no outstanding
"significant deficiency" or "material weakness" which Crowns independent
accountants certify has not been appropriately and adequately remedied by
Crown.

(e) The effectiveness of any additional SEC disclosure requirement that, as
of the date of this Agreement, has been formally proposed that is not yet in
effect, is not expected by Crown to lead to any materially adverse change in
Crowns disclosures as set forth in the Crown SEC Reports.

(f) None of the Crown Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since January 1,
2004 been, subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d)
of the Exchange Act.

Section 4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as contemplated by
this Agreement, since the date of the most recent audited financial statements
included in the Crown SEC Reports and through the date hereof, each of Crown
and the Crown Subsidiaries has conducted its respective businesses only
in the ordinary course in all material respects and in a manner consistent
with prior practice in all material respects and there has not been any event
or occurrence of any condition that has had or is reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except as
contemplated by this Agreement, since the date of the most recent audited
financial statements included in the Crown SEC Reports and through the date
hereof, there has not been (i) any material change in accounting methods,
principles or practices employed by Crown or (ii) any action of the types
described in Section 5.2(b) or Section 5.2(c) which, had such action been
taken after the date of this Agreement, would be in violation of any such
Section.

Section 4.9 _Taxes_.

(a) Each of Crown and the Crown Subsidiaries has duly filed all Tax Returns
required to be filed by it or has been granted extensions to file such
Tax Returns, which extensions have not expired, and all such Tax Returns are
true, complete and accurate, except to the extent that all such failures to
file, taken together, have not had and are not reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Crown and each of the Crown Subsidiaries have paid
(or Crown has paid on its behalf) all Taxes (i) shown as due on such Tax
Returns or (ii) otherwise due and payable, except for those Taxes (x) being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate
reserves have been established in the financial statements included in the
Crown SEC Reports in accordance with GAAP or (y) that have not had and are not
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. There are no Liens for any Taxes upon the assets of Crown or
the Crown Subsidiaries, other than (i) statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due
and payable, (ii) Liens for Taxes contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and (iii) Liens that are not, and are not reasonably expected to
be, material to the businesses of Crown and the Crown Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

(b) Crown had at least $1,437,000,000 of "net operating loss carryovers"
within the meaning of Section 172 of the Code as of December 31, 2005, which
are not subject to any limitations pursuant to Section 382 of the Code as of
the date hereof but which may  



 

40  become subject to such limitations in connection with the Merger. Crown
anticipates that for each taxable year following the Merger, any "Section
382 limitation" (as defined in Section 382(b) of the Code) that may be
imposed upon Crowns use of such net operating loss carryovers will equal or
exceed Crowns anticipated taxable income (calculated without regard to
any deductions attributable to such net operating loss carryovers that are
available to Crown under the Code).

(c) No Tax Return of Crown or a Crown Subsidiary is or has ever been audited
or examined by any tax authority, and no notice of such an audit or
examination has been received by Crown or a Crown Subsidiary. No deficiencies
for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed in writing against
Crown or any of the Crown Subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved for,
except for deficiencies that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and are not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and
no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such taxes have been
granted or are pending (other than with respect to years that are currently
under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or other applicable taxing
authorities).

(d) Neither Crown nor any of the Crown Subsidiaries has taken any action or
has any knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely

50  and to fulfill the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI, _provided_ that, in
the case of consents of parties to contracts, none of Global, Crown or
Merger Sub shall be required to make any payment to any such third parties or
concede anything of value to obtain such consents, (ii) make all required
regulatory filings and applications and (iii) cause the conditions set forth
in ARTICLE VI to be satisfied as promptly as practicable. No party hereto
shall take any action that would prohibit or materially impair or delay the
ability of any party to obtain any necessary approvals of any Governmental
Entity required for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to
otherwise consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If at
any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers of each
party to this Agreement and the Surviving Company shall use all reasonable
best efforts to take all such action. For purposes of this Section 5.5,
"reasonable best efforts" may include, but shall not be deemed in each case
that may arise under this Agreement to require, the obligation to enter into a
settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or other agreement with a
Governmental Entity regarding antitrust matters that requires a party to
divest or hold separate any of its or its subsidiaries assets.

(b) In connection with, and without limiting the foregoing, Global and
Crown shall, if required, duly file with the FTC (as defined in Section
5.5(c)) and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ (as defined in Section 5.5(c))
the notification and report form (the " _HSR Filing_ ") required under
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable. The HSR Filing shall be in substantial compliance
with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each party shall cooperate with the
other party to the extent necessary to request early termination of the
waiting period required by the HSR Act and, if requested, to promptly amend or
furnish additional information thereunder. Global and the Global Board shall
(i) take all actions necessary to ensure that no state anti-takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation is or becomes operative with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (ii) if any state anti-takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes operative with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all actions
necessary to ensure that this Agreement, the Merger and any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Each of Global and Crown shall, in connection with its obligation to use
reasonable best efforts to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations
for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any
other federal, state or foreign antitrust or fair trade law, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication
received by such party from or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) permit the other party, or the other partys legal counsel, to
review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other
Governmental Entity or, in  



 

51  connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person,
and (iv) give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meetings and conferences.

(d) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Law or if any suit is instituted by any
Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of any Law, each of Global and Crown shall
use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or challenges
as such Governmental Entity or private party may have to such transactions
under such Law so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(e) Crown shall perform, or cause to be performed, when due all obligations of
Merger Sub under this Agreement.

Section 5.6 _No Solicitation; Board Recommendation_.

(a) _Global_.

(i) Global shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of the
Global Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action
designed to, or which is reasonably expected to, facilitate, any Global
Takeover Proposal, (B) enter into any agreement with respect to any Global
Takeover Proposal or (C) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate with, any proposal that
constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, any Global Takeover
Proposal. Global shall, and shall cause the Global Subsidiaries and its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore
with respect to any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to
lead to, any Global Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Global
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Global Takeover
Proposal that the Global Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, a Global
Superior Proposal (as defined below), and which Global Takeover Proposal was
not solicited after the date hereof, was made after the date hereof and did
not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.6(a)(i), Global may, if a
majority of the Global Board determines in good faith (after receiving the
advice of outside counsel) that it is necessary to take such actions in order
to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Global under
applicable Law, and subject to compliance with this Section 5.6(a)(i) and
Section 5.6(a)(iii) and after giving Crown written notice of such
determination, (x) furnish information with respect to Global and the Global
Subsidiaries to the person making such Global Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (which
agreement shall contain a customary "standstill" or similar covenant) not less
restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement  



 

52  (including with respect to the "standstill" or similar covenant); _provided_
that (1) all such information has previously been provided to Crown or is
provided to Crown prior to the time it is provided to such person and (2) such
customary confidentiality agreement expressly provides the right for Global to
comply with the terms of this Agreement, including Section 5.6(a)(ii), and
(y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Global Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Global
Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.6(a)(i) by any
Representative or affiliate of Global or any Global Subsidiary shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Section 5.6(a)(i) by Global.

The term " _Global Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer
from any person relating to, or that is reasonably expected to lead to, any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the
revenues, net income, EBITDA (earnings before interest expense,
taxes, depreciation and amortization) or the assets of Global and the Global
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity
securities of Global or any Global Subsidiary, any tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15%
or more of any class of equity securities of Global or any Global Subsidiary,
or any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar
transaction involving Global or any Global Subsidiary pursuant to which any
person or the stockholders of any person would own 15% or more of any class of
equity securities of Global or any Global Subsidiary or of any
resulting parent company of Global, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

The term " _Global Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Global Takeover
Proposal (provided that for purposes of this definition references to 15% in
the definition of "Global Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be references
to 50%) which the Global Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) to be (i) more favorable to the stockholders of Global from a
financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account all relevant
factors (including all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Crown in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of
being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal.

(ii) Neither the Global Board nor any committee thereof shall, (A) (1)
withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Crown or Merger Sub), or
publicly propose to withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
Crown or Merger Sub), the adoption, approval, recommendation or declaration
of advisability by such board of directors or any such committee thereof of
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (2) recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, any Global
Takeover Proposal  



 

53  (any action described in this clause (A) being referred to as a " _Global

advisable, or propose to adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
allow Global or any of the Global Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to,
or that is intended to or is reasonably expected to lead to, any
Global Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in Section 5.6(a)(i) pursuant to and in accordance with the limitations set
forth therein). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining
the Global Stockholder Approval, the Global Board may make a Global Adverse
Recommendation Change described in clause (A) above if a majority of the
Global Board determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of outside
counsel) that it is necessary to take such actions in order to comply with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Global under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such Global Adverse Recommendation Change may
be made until after the fifth calendar day following Crowns receipt of
written notice (a " _Global Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ") from Global
advising Crown that the Global Board intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any
Global Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the
Global Board (it being understood and agreed that (x) any amendment to any
material term of such Global Superior Proposal or (y) with respect to any
previous Global Adverse Recommendation Change, any material change in the
principal stated rationale by the Global Board for such previous Global
Adverse Recommendation Change, shall, in the case of either (x) or (y),
require a new Global Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a new five (5)
calendar-day period). In determining whether to make a Global Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Global Board shall take into account any changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Crown in response to a Global Notice
of Adverse Recommendation or otherwise.

(iii) In addition to the obligations of Global set forth in Section 5.6(a)(i)
and (a)(ii), (A) Global shall promptly advise Crown orally and in writing (and
in any case within 24 hours) of any Global Takeover Proposal or any inquiry
that is reasonably expected to lead to any Global Takeover Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of any such Global Takeover Proposal or inquiry
(including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such
Global Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (B) Global shall (1) keep Crown fully
and promptly informed of the status and material details (including any change
to any material term thereof) of any such Global Takeover Proposal or inquiry
and (2) provide to Crown promptly after receipt or delivery thereof with
copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to
Global or any of the Global Subsidiaries from any person that describes any of
the terms or conditions of any Global Takeover Proposal. 



 

54 (iv) Nothing contained in this Section 5.6(a) shall prohibit Global from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14(e)-2(a) or Rule 14(d)-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any disclosure to Globals stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Global Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose
would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
actions taken or agreed to be taken by Global or the Global Board or any
committee thereof shall comply with the provisions of Section 5.6(a)(ii).

(b) _Crown_.

(i) Crown shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of the Crown
Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (A)
solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which
is reasonably expected to, facilitate, any Crown Takeover Proposal (as defined
below), (B) enter into any agreement with respect to any Crown Takeover
Proposal or (C) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate with, any proposal that
constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, any Crown Takeover
Proposal. Crown shall, and shall cause the Crown Subsidiaries and its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect
to any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, any
Crown Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to obtaining the Crown Stockholder Approval, in response to
a bona fide written Crown Takeover Proposal that the Crown Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes, or is reasonably
expected to lead to, a Crown Superior Proposal (as defined below), and which
Crown Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof, was made
after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 5.6(b)(i), Crown may, if a majority of the Crown Board determines in
good faith (after receiving the advice of outside counsel) that it is
necessary to take such actions in order to comply with its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of Crown under applicable Law, and subject to compliance
with this Section 5.6(b)(i) and Section 5.6(b)(iii) and after giving Global
written notice of such determination, (x) furnish information with respect to
Crown and the Crown Subsidiaries to the person making such Crown Takeover
Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement (which agreement shall contain a customary "standstill" or similar
covenant) not less restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality
Agreement (including with respect to the "standstill" or similar covenant);
_provided_ that (1) all such information has previously been provided to
Global or is provided to Global prior to the time it is provided to such
person and (2) such customary confidentiality agreement expressly provides the
right for Crown to comply with the terms of this Agreement, including Section
5.6(b)(ii), and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person
making such  



 

55  Crown Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Crown
Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.6(b)(i) by any
Representative or affiliate of Crown or any Crown Subsidiary shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Section 5.6(b)(i) by Crown.

The term " _Crown Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer
from any person relating to, or that is reasonably expected to lead to, any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the

taxes, depreciation and amortization) or the assets of Crown and the Crown
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity
securities of Crown or any Crown Subsidiary, any tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15%
or more of any class of equity securities of Crown or any Crown Subsidiary, or
any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar
transaction involving Crown or any Crown Subsidiary pursuant to which any
person or the stockholders of any person would own 15% or more of any class of
equity securities of Crown or any Crown Subsidiary or of any resulting parent
company of Crown, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any inquiry, proposal or offer relating solely
to the acquisition of any such (i) equity securities of any
Crown Subsidiaries, (ii) assets or (iii) businesses, in each case, that are

Takeover Proposal".

The term " _Crown Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Crown Takeover
Proposal (provided that for purposes of this definition references to 15% in
the definition of "Crown Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be references
to 50%) which the Crown Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) to be (i) more favorable to the stockholders of Crown from a
financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account all relevant
factors (including all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Global in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of
being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal.

(ii) Neither the Crown Board nor any committee thereof shall, (A) (1) withdraw
(or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Global), or publicly propose to
withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Global), the adoption,
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such board of
directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Share
Issuance) or (2) recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, any Crown
Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (A) being referred to

advisable, or propose to adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
allow Crown or any of the Crown Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or
related to, or that is intended to or is reasonably expected to lead to, any
Crown Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 5.6(b)(i) pursuant to and in accordance with the limitations set
forth therein). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining
the Crown Stockholder Approval, the Crown Board may make a Crown Adverse
Recommendation Change described in clause (A) above if a majority of the
Crown Board determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of outside
counsel) that it is necessary to take such actions in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Crown under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such Crown Adverse Recommendation Change may
be made until after the fifth calendar day following Globals receipt of
written notice (a " _Crown Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ") from Crown
advising Global that the Crown Board intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any
Crown Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Crown
Board (it being understood and agreed that (x) any amendment to any material
term of such Crown Superior Proposal or (y) with respect to any previous Crown
Adverse Recommendation Change, any material change in the principal stated
rationale by the Crown Board for such previous Crown Adverse Recommendation
Change, shall, in the case of either (x) or (y), require a new Crown Notice of
Adverse Recommendation and a new five (5) calendar-day period).
In determining whether to make a Crown Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Crown Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Global in response to a Crown Notice of Adverse Recommendation or
otherwise. 

(iii) In addition to the obligations of Crown set forth in Sections 5.6(b)(i)
and (b)(ii), (A) Crown shall promptly advise Global orally and in writing
(and in any case within 24 hours) of any Crown Takeover Proposal or any
inquiry that is reasonably expected to lead to any Crown Takeover Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of any such Crown Takeover Proposal or
inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making
any such Crown Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (B) Crown shall (1) keep
Global fully and promptly informed of the status and material details
(including any change to any material term thereof) of any such Crown Takeover
Proposal or inquiry and (2) provide to Global promptly after receipt or
delivery thereof with copies of all correspondence and other written material
sent or provided to Crown or any of the Crown Subsidiaries from any person
that describes any of the terms or conditions of any Crown Takeover Proposal.

(iv) Nothing contained in this Section 5.6(b) shall prohibit Crown from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14(e)-  



 

57  2(a) or Rule 14(d)-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to Crowns stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Crown Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so
disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all actions taken or agreed to be taken by Crown or the Crown Board or
any committee thereof shall comply with the provisions of Section 5.6(b)(ii).

Section 5.7 _Stockholder Litigation_. Global shall give Crown and Crowns
outside counsel the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of
any stockholder Litigation against Global and its directors relating to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_
, _however_ , that no such settlement shall be agreed to without Crowns prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Crown shall consult in good faith with Global and keep Global reasonably
informed with respect to any stockholder Litigation against Crown and its
directors relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Crown shall not agree, prior to the Effective Time, to any
settlement of such Litigation against it and its directors if such settlement
agreement (i) does not resolve any equivalent claims against Global and its
directors, (ii) contains any admission of liability by Global or Globals
directors or officers or (iii) results in any non-monetary relief being
granted against Global with effect prior to the Effective Time.

Section 5.8 _Indemnification_.

(a) It is understood and agreed that all rights to indemnification by Global
now existing in favor of each present and former director and officer of
Global (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") for acts or omissions by such directors
and officers occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the
Global Certificate of Incorporation or the Global Bylaws, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in
effect on the date hereof, copies of which have been provided to Crown, shall
survive the Merger, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with the terms of the Global Certificate of Incorporation, the Global Bylaws
and such other agreements from the Effective Time until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such
directors or officers arising out of such acts or omissions. Crown shall
perform, or cause the Surviving Company to perform, in a timely manner, the
Surviving Companys obligations with respect thereto. Crown agrees that
any claims for indemnification hereunder as to which it has received written
notice prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable
thereto shall survive, whether or not such claims shall have been finally
adjudicated or settled as of such date.

(b) Crown shall cause the Surviving Company to, and the Surviving Company
shall, maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time, if
available, the directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO

contained in the policies currently maintained by Global (provided that the
Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially less
favorable) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving
Company be required to expend pursuant to this Section 5.8(b) more than an
amount per year equal to two hundred percent (200%) of current annual premiums
paid by Global for the DandO Insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso
to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Company  



 

58  would be required to expend more than two hundred percent (200%) of current
annual premiums, the Surviving Company shall obtain the maximum amount
of such insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to two
hundred percent (200%) of current annual premiums.

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.8 will survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. Crown will pay or
cause to be paid (as incurred) all out-of-pocket expenses, including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Party may incur
in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section
5.8 (subject to reimbursement of Crown if the Indemnified Party is
subsequently determined not be entitled to indemnification under Section
5.8(a)).

(d) If Crown or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,

be made so that the successors and assigns of Crown, as the case may be, will
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. Global and Crown shall consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by Law or any listing agreement with a national securities
exchange or trading system to which Global or Crown is a party. The parties
agree that the initial press release(s) to be issued with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form agreed
to by the parties.

Section 5.10 _Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i)
Crown and Global shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC the joint proxy

Crown relating to the meeting of Globals stockholders (the " _Global
Stockholders  Meeting_") and to the meeting of Crowns stockholders (the "
_Crown Stockholders  Meeting_") to be held to consider, in the case of
Globals stockholders, the approval and adoption of this Agreement, and in the

qualified) required under any applicable federal or state securities laws in
connection with such actions and the preparation of the Registration  



 

59  Statement and Joint Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement shall have become effective, Global shall mail the
Joint Proxy Statement to its stockholders and Crown shall mail the Joint
Proxy Statement to its stockholders.

(b) No amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement
will be made by Crown or Global without the approval of the other party (such

SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement
or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information.

Statement, Global shall promptly notify Crown of such event, and Global and

Section 5.11 _Stockholders  Meetings_.

(a) Global shall cause the Global Stockholders Meeting to be duly called and
held as soon as practicable for the purpose of obtaining the

necessary or, in the reasonable judgment of Crown, helpful to secure the vote
or consent of such holders required by the DGCL, the rules and regulations of
the NYSE or this Agreement to effect the Merger. Notwithstanding any Global
Adverse Recommendation Change, this Agreement shall be submitted to the
stockholders of Global at the Global Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of
obtaining the Global Stockholder Approval and nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to relieve Global of such obligation; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not be deemed to limit Globals right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 7.1(h).

(b) Crown shall cause the Crown Stockholders Meeting to be duly called and
held as soon as practicable for the purpose of obtaining the Crown Stockholder
Approval and Crown shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the Crown
Stockholders Meeting as soon as practicable after the date on which the
Registration Statement becomes effective and on the same date as the Global
Stockholders Meeting. Crown shall take all action necessary in accordance
with applicable Law, the Crown Certificate of Incorporation and the Crown
Bylaws to duly call, give notice of and convene the Crown Stockholders
Meeting. Except in the event of a Crown Adverse Recommendation Change, Crown
shall (i) through the Crown Board, recommend to its stockholders that they
give the Crown Stockholder Approval and include such recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from
holders of shares of Crown Common Stock entitled to vote at the Crown
Stockholders Meeting proxies in favor of obtaining the Crown Stockholder
Approval and (iii) take all other action necessary or, in the reasonable
judgment of Global, helpful to secure the vote or consent of such holders
required by the DGCL, the rules and regulations of the NYSE or this Agreement
to effect the Merger. Notwithstanding any Crown Adverse Recommendation Change,
this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of Crown at the Crown
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Crown Stockholder
Approval and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Crown of such
obligation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not be deemed to
limit Crowns right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance
with Section 7.1(e).

Section 5.12 _NYSE Listing and De-Listing_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Crown shall authorize for listing on the NYSE the shares of Crown Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger, subject to official notice of
issuance, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and in any
event prior to the Closing Date. The Surviving Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Global Common Stock to be de-listed from
the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time. 

Section 5.13 _Composition of Board of Directors of Crown_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Crown shall expand the size of the Crown Board from ten
directors to thirteen directors. Crown shall appoint each of (i) Robert
Niehaus and David Abrams to the Crown Board effective as of the Effective Time
and (ii) Wesley Edens to the Crown Board effective as of one day following
the Effective Time. If any of Wesley Edens, Robert Niehaus and David Abrams
are unwilling or unable to serve as a director of Crown commencing as of the
Effective Time, then Global shall designate another individual or individuals,
as the case may be, who must be reasonably acceptable to Crown, to serve on
the Crown Board as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.13, no individual shall be appointed  



 

61  to the Crown Board to the extent that such individual is ineligible to serve
as a member of the Crown Board pursuant to the Crown Certificate
of Incorporation, Crown Bylaws, Crowns corporate governance guidelines,
applicable listing standards of the NYSE or any other applicable Law, rule or
regulation.

Section 5.14 _Tax Treatment of Merger_. Each of Crown and Global shall use
reasonable best efforts to (a) cause the Merger to qualify as a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) obtain the opinions
of counsel referred to in Section 6.2(d) and Section 6.3(d). Following the
Effective Time, neither Crown nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of its
affiliates, shall knowingly take any action or cause any action to be taken
which would cause the Merger to fail to so qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code.

Section 5.15 _Accountant Letters_.

(a) Global shall use reasonable best efforts to cause Ernst and Young LLP to
deliver a letter relating to Globals fiscal years 2003, 2004 and 2005 dated
not more than five days prior to the date on which the Registration Statement
shall have become effective and addressed to Global and Crown in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Crown and customary in scope and
substance for agreed upon procedures letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements and proxy statements
similar to the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement;
_provided_ that the failure of such a letter to be delivered by Ernst and Young
LLP shall not result in a failure of a condition to Closing (including Section
6.2(b) or (c) hereof).

(b) Crown shall use reasonable best efforts to cause KPMG LLP to deliver a
letter relating to Crowns fiscal years 2003, 2004 and 2005 dated not more
than five days prior to the date on which the Registration Statement shall
have become effective and addressed to Crown and Global in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Global and customary in scope and substance for
agreed upon procedures letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements and proxy statements similar to the
Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement; _provided_ that the
failure of such a letter to be delivered by KPMG LLP shall not result in a
failure of a condition to Closing (including Section 6.3(b) or (c) hereof).

Section 5.16 _Affiliates_. As soon as practicable after the date hereof,
Global shall deliver to Crown a letter identifying all persons who are, in the
opinion of Global, at the time this Agreement is submitted for adoption by
the stockholders of Global, "affiliates" of Global for purposes of Rule 145
under the Securities Act. Global shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each such person to deliver to Crown on or prior to the date of mailing
of the Joint Proxy Statement, a written agreement substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit 5.16 hereto; _provided_ that the failure of any such
letter to be delivered shall not result in a failure of a condition to Closing
(including Section 6.2(b) or (c) hereof).

Section 5.17 _Standstill Agreements; Confidentiality Agreements_. During the
period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, neither
Crown nor Global shall terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its respective
Subsidiaries is a party. During such period, Crown



 

62  or Global, as the case may be, shall enforce, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, the provisions of any such agreement,
including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of
the United States of America or of any state having jurisdiction.

Section 5.18 _Employees_.

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Crown shall or
shall cause the Surviving Company to either (i) provide the employees of
Global and the Global Subsidiaries who are employed immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Covered Employees_ ") who remain employed during such
period by Crown, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
with compensation and benefits (excluding equity based compensation) that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation and benefits
provided by Global and the Global Subsidiaries as of the date hereof or (ii)
provide or cause the Surviving Company (or, in such case, its successors or
assigns) to provide Covered Employees who remain employed during such period
by Crown, the Surviving Company or their respective Subsidiaries with
compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to those provided to similarly situated employees of Crown and the Crown
Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Section 5.18 shall be construed as requiring,
and Global shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Crown
or the Surviving Company to continue any specific plans or to continue the
employment of any specific person. Furthermore, nothing in this Section 5.18
shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting Crown or the Surviving Company
from amending, modifying or terminating any plans, programs or
arrangements of Crown, Global or the Surviving Company.

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, and non-
forfeitable rights under, but not for purposes of benefit accrual under, any
employee benefit plan or arrangement of Crown or the Surviving Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, Covered Employees shall receive service
credit for service with Global (and with any predecessor or acquired entities
or any other entities for which Global granted service credit) as if such
service had been completed with Crown; _provided, however_ , that such service
need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in
any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(c) To the extent applicable, Crown shall or shall cause the Surviving
Company and any of their respective Subsidiaries to waive, or use reasonable
best efforts to cause its insurance carriers to waive, any pre-existing
condition limitation on participation and coverage applicable to any
Covered Employee or any of his or her covered dependents under any health or
welfare plan of Crown or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (a " _New Plan_ ") in which such Covered Employee or covered
dependent shall become eligible to participate after the Effective Time to
the extent such Covered Employee or covered dependent was no longer subject to
such pre-existing condition limitation under the corresponding Global Benefit
Plan in which such Covered Employee or such covered dependent was
participating immediately before he or she became eligible to participate in
the New Plan. Crown shall or shall cause the Surviving Company or the relevant
Subsidiary of either to provide each Covered Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time and during the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs under any  



 

63  Global Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment and deductible
requirements for such calendar year under any New Plan in which such
Covered Employee participates after the Effective Time.

(d) Crown shall recognize, or shall cause the Surviving Company and any of
their respective Subsidiaries to recognize, any unused paid time off and sick
leave hours available to each Covered Employee as of the Effective Time under
Globals paid time off policy applicable to such Covered Employee and,
notwithstanding Section 5.18(b) hereof, to recognize service by each Covered
Employee with Global for purposes of determining eligibility for vacation and
sick leave following the Effective Time under the applicable vacation and sick
leave policies of Crown or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.

(e) Without limiting the scope of Section 8.1, nothing in this Section 5.18
shall confer any rights or remedies of any kind or description upon any
Covered Employee or any other person other than Global and Crown and their
respective successors and assigns.

Section 5.19 _Rights Agreement_. Except as expressly required by this
Agreement, Crown shall not, without the prior consent of Global (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), amend the Rights
Agreement or take any other action with respect to the Rights Agreement,
including a redemption of the Rights or any action to facilitate a Crown
Takeover Proposal.

Section 5.20 _Investor Agreement_. Global shall terminate the Amended and
Restated Investor Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2004, by and among Global
and the Investors (as defined therein) at or prior to the Effective Time.

imposed on Global (including any penalties or interest with respect thereto),
if any, which are attributable to the transfer of the beneficial ownership of
Globals real property (collectively, the " _Real Estate Transfer Taxes_ ")
as a result of the Merger.

(c) (i) In the event that: (x) (A) after the date of this Agreement, a Crown
Takeover Proposal shall have been made to Crown and such Crown Takeover
Proposal becomes publicly known prior to the Crown Stockholders Meeting or
shall have been made directly to the stockholders of Crown generally prior
to the Crown Stockholders Meeting and, in either case, such Crown Takeover
Proposal shall not have been withdrawn at the time of the Crown Stockholders

to Section 7.1(b)(ii) and (C) within 12 months after such termination, Crown

forth in the definition of Crown Takeover Proposal contained in Section 5.6(b)
except that all references to "15%" shall be deemed references to "35%"); or
(y) this Agreement is terminated by Global pursuant to Section 7.1(g); or (z)
this Agreement is terminated by Crown pursuant to Section 7.1(e), then,
subject to Section 7.3, Crown shall pay Global a fee equal to $139,000,000
(the " _Crown Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same-day funds promptly
after receipt of notice from Global that the Escrow Agreement (as defined in

either (x) Section 7.1(f) or (y) Section 7.1(b)(ii) (and no amount is payable

transfer of same-day funds promptly after receipt of notice from Global that
the Escrow Agreement has been executed by the parties thereto pursuant to
Section 7.3(a) (which execution shall occur as soon as practicable following
the termination of this Agreement as referred to in this sentence); _provided_
that the foregoing shall not limit or be deemed to limit any liability of
Crown or damages or other remedy to which Global may be entitled as a result
of any willful breach of this Agreement by Crown. Crown will not be obligated
to make a payment pursuant to this Section 7.2(c)(ii) if Crown has paid or is
required to pay the Crown Termination Fee set forth in Section 7.2(c)(i), and
any fees paid by Crown under this Section 7.2(c)(ii) will be credited against
any such Crown Termination Fee to the extent that such fee subsequently
becomes payable by Crown.

(iii) Crown acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2(c)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Global would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Crown fails promptly to pay the amount(s) due pursuant to this
Section 7.2(c), and, to obtain such payment, Global commences a suit which
results in a judgment against Crown for the amount(s) due pursuant to this

Proposal becomes publicly known prior to the Global Stockholders Meeting or
shall have been made directly to the stockholders of Global generally prior to
the Global Stockholders Meeting and, in either case, such Global Takeover
Proposal shall not have been withdrawn at the time of the Global
Stockholders Meeting, (B) this Agreement is terminated by Crown or Global
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) and (C) within 12 months after such

purposes of this Section 7.2(d)(i)(x)(C), the term "Global Takeover Proposal"
shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Global Takeover Proposal
contained in Section 5.6(a) except that all references to "15%" shall be
deemed references to "35%"); or (y) this Agreement is terminated by Crown
pursuant to Section 7.1(d); or (z) this Agreement is terminated by Global
pursuant to Section 7.1(h), then Global shall pay Crown a fee equal to
$139,000,000 (the " _Global Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same-day
funds on the date of termination of this Agreement (except that in the case
of termination pursuant to clause (x) above, such payment shall be made on the
date of execution of such definitive agreement or, if earlier, consummation of
such transactions).

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Crown pursuant to
either (x) Section 7.1(c) or (y) Section 7.1(b)(iii) (and no amount is
payable by Global pursuant to Section 7.2(d)(i)), then Global shall pay Crown
a fee equal to  



 

70  Crowns out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Crown
Expenses_ "), but not in excess of $10,000,000 by wire transfer of same-day
funds three (3) business days after the date of such termination of this
Agreement as referred to in this sentence; _provided_ that the foregoing
shall not limit or be deemed to limit any liability of Global or damages or
other remedy to which Crown may be entitled as a result of any willful breach
of this Agreement by Global. Global will not be obligated to make a
payment pursuant to this Section 7.2(d)(ii) if Global has paid or is required
to pay the Global Termination Fee set forth in Section 7.2(d)(i), and any fees
paid by Global under this Section 7.2(d)(ii) will be credited against any such
Global Termination Fee to the extent that such fee subsequently becomes
payable by Global.

(iii) Global acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.2(d) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Crown would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Global fails promptly to pay the amount(s) due
pursuant to this Section 7.2(d), and, to obtain such payment, Crown commences
a suit which results in a judgment against Global for the amount(s) due
pursuant to this Section 7.2(d), Global shall pay to Crown its out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on such amount(s) at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. 

Section 7.3 _Payments to Global_.

(a) In the event that Crown is obligated to pay to Global the Crown
Termination Fee or the Global Expenses pursuant to Section 7.2(c)
(collectively, the " _Break-Up Amount_ "), Crown shall deposit into escrow an
amount in cash equal to the Break-Up Amount with an escrow agent reasonably
selected by Global, after reasonable consultation with Crown, and pursuant to
a written escrow agreement (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") reflecting the terms
set forth in this Section 7.3 and otherwise reasonably acceptable to each of
Global and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Break-
Up Amount pursuant to this Section 7.3(a) shall be made by Crown promptly
after receipt of notice from Global that the Escrow Agreement has been
executed by the parties thereto.

(b) The Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Break-Up Amount in escrow or
the applicable portion thereof shall be released to Global on an annual basis
based upon the delivery by Global to the escrow agent of any one or a
combination of the following: (i) a letter from Globals independent certified
public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the
escrow agent to Global without causing Global to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the applicable
taxable year of Global determined as if the payment of such amount did not
constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I)
of the Code (such income, " _Qualifying Income_ "), in which case the escrow
agent shall release to Global such maximum amount stated in the accountants
letter, or (ii) a letter from Globals counsel indicating that Global
received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by Global of the
Break-Up Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or  



 

71  would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, Globals outside counsel or accountant
has rendered a legal opinion or a tax opinion, respectively, to the effect
that the receipt by Global of the Break-Up Amount would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the escrow agent shall
release to Global the remainder of the Break-Up Amount. Crown agrees to
cooperate in good faith to amend this Section 7.3 at the reasonable request of
Global in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Break-Up Amount that may
be distributed to Global hereunder without causing Global to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve Globals
chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section 7.3(b) or
(z) assist Global in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside
counsel or accountant as described in this Section 7.3(b). The Escrow
Agreement shall also provide that Global shall bear all costs and expenses
under the Escrow Agreement and that any portion of the Break-Up Amount held in
escrow for ten (10) years shall be released by the escrow agent to Crown.
Crown shall not be a party to the Escrow Agreement and shall not bear any
liability, cost or expense resulting directly or indirectly from the Escrow
Agreement (other than any Crown Taxes associated with the release of funds to
Crown from the escrow). Global shall fully indemnify Crown and hold Crown
harmless from and against any such liability, cost or expense.

Section 7.4 _Amendments_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by
their respective boards of directors, at any time before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of
Crown and Global; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the stockholders of Crown and
Global, there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any
amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the
consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Global
Common Stock, or which by applicable Law otherwise expressly requires the
further approval of such stockholders. No amendment shall be made to this
Agreement after the Effective Time. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

Section 7.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after the Global Stockholders Meeting and the Crown Stockholders
Meeting, any party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any
of the covenants, obligations or other acts of any other party hereto or (ii)
subject to applicable Law, waive any inaccuracy of any representations or
warranties or compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions
of any other party or with any conditions to its own obligations. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party by its duly authorized officer. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights. The waiver of any such right with
respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a
waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.

_Form of Affiliate Letter_

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned refers to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger
Agreement_ ") dated as of October 5, 2006, by and among Crown Castle
International Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Crown_ "), CCGS Holdings LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Crown,
and Global Signal Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Global_ "). Capitalized
terms used but not defined in this letter have the meanings give such terms in
the Merger Agreement.

The undersigned, a holder of shares of Global Common Stock, is entitled to
receive in connection with the Merger shares of Crown Common Stock. The
undersigned acknowledges that the undersigned may be deemed an "affiliate"
of Global within the meaning of Rule 145 (" _Rule 145_") promulgated under
the Securities Act, although nothing contained herein should be construed as
an admission of such fact.

If in fact the undersigned were an affiliate under the Securities Act, the
undersigneds ability to sell, assign or transfer the Crown Common
Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for any shares of Global Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger may be restricted unless such sale, assignment,
or transfer is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is available. The undersigned (i) understands that such
exemptions are limited and (ii) has obtained advice of counsel as to the
nature and conditions of such exemptions, including information with respect
to the applicability to the sale of such securities of Rules 144 and 145(d)
promulgated under the Securities Act. The undersigned understands that, other
than as may be required by the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, Crown will
not be required to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement
under the Securities Act for purposes of resale of Crown Common Stock by the
undersigned.

The undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with Crown that the
undersigned will not sell, assign or transfer any of the Crown Common Stock
received by the undersigned in exchange for shares of Global Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger except (i) pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the volume and
other limitations of Rule 144 or (iii) in a transaction that, in the opinion
of independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to Crown or as described in a
"no-action" or interpretive letter from the Staff of the SEC, is not required
to be registered under the Securities Act.

In the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned pursuant to
Rule 145 of Crown Common Stock received by the undersigned in the Merger, the
undersigned will supply Crown with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in
the form of a letter in the form of Annex I hereto and the opinion of counsel
or no-action letter referred to above. The undersigned understands that Crown
may instruct its transfer agent to withhold the transfer of any Crown Common
Stock disposed of by the undersigned, but that upon receipt of such evidence
of compliance the transfer agent shall effectuate the transfer of the Crown
Common Stock sold as indicated in the letter. The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that appropriate legends will be
placed on certificates representing Crown Common Stock received by the
undersigned in the Merger or held by a transferee thereof, which legends will
be removed by delivery of substitute certificates upon receipt of an opinion
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Crown from independent
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Crown to the effect that such legends are
no longer required for purposes of the Securities Act.

The undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read this
letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed
upon the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of Crown Common
Stock and (ii) the receipt by Crown of this letter is an inducement and a
condition to Crowns obligations to consummate the Merger.

This Agreement shall only become effective as of the Effective Time of the
Merger.

Very truly yours,

Dated: ANNEX I TO

EXHIBIT 5.16
