portions thereof through the  date of such financial statements.

 

 

(c)  No  deficiency with respect to any Taxes has been proposed, asserted
or assessed  in  writing against Domtar or any Domtar Subsidiary, except to

other person that, together with  Domtar is treated as a single employer
under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or  (o) of the Code or any other applicable
Law, providing benefits to any current  or former officer, manager, director

Subsidiary as of the Effective  Time) (an " _Domtar  Employee_ ")  or 
(ii) in respect of which Domtar or any Domtar Subsidiary would reasonably  be

SECTION  3.11. _Employment  Agreements; ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute
Payments._   (a)  Section 3.11(a) of the Domtar Disclosure Letter contains a
list of each  Domtar Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan"
(as defined in  Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as  amended (" _ERISA_ "))  (" _Domtar  U.S. Pension Plans_ "), 
"registered pension plan" (as defined in Section 248(1) of the ITA)  ("
_Domtar  Canadian Pension Plans_ ") ** _,_** "employee  welfare benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) (" _Domtar_ _  U.S.  Welfare
Plans_ "),  employee health and welfare plan maintained for the benefit of
Domtar Employees  employed in Canada (" _Domtar  Canadian_ _  Welfare
Plans_ ")  and  all other material Domtar Benefit  Plans.  For the
avoidance of doubt, the term "Domtar U.S. Pension Plans" shall not  include
any Domtar Canadian Pension Plans, and the term "Domtar U.S. Welfare  Plans"
shall not include any Domtar Canadian Welfare  Plans.  Section 3.11(a) of
the Domtar Disclosure Letter contains a list of each  material employment,
consulting, indemnification, severance, termination, change  in control,
bonus, retention or similar agreement or arrangement between Domtar  or any
Domtar Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any individual Domtar Employee,  on
the other hand (collectively, " _Domtar  Benefit Agreements_ ").  The 
Domtar Benefit  Plans  (other  than any "multi-employer pension plan", as
defined under applicable Canadian  federal or provincial pension standards
legislation (an " _Domtar  Canadian MEPP_ ")  and  the Domtar Benefit
Agreements have been administered in compliance with their  terms  and 
applicable Law,  other  than instances of non-compliance that, individually
and in the aggregate, have  not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Domtar Material Adverse  Effect. Domtar has delivered or made
available to Weyerhaeuser and Spinco true,  complete and correct copies of
(i) each Domtar Benefit Plan (other than any  Domtar Canadian MEPP) and
Domtar Benefit Agreement required to be listed on  Section 3.11(a) of the
Domtar Disclosure Letter (or, in the case of any  unwritten Domtar Benefit
Plan or Domtar Benefit Agreement required to be listed  on Section 3.11(a) of
the Domtar Disclosure Letter, a description thereof),  (ii) the most recent
annual report on Form 5500 filed with respect to each such  Domtar Benefit
Plan (if any such report was required), (iii) the most recent  summary plan
description for each such Domtar Benefit Plan (other than any  Domtar
Canadian MEPP) for which such summary plan description is required,  (iv)
each trust agreement, group annuity contract or other funding  agreement or
contract relating to each such Domtar Benefit Plan, and (v) the  most recent
actuarial valuation report, if any, for each such Domtar Benefit  Plan.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)  All  Domtar U.S. Pension Plans intended to be tax qualified have been
the subject  of  determination letters from the IRS, with respect to all tax
Law changes with  respect to which the IRS is currently willing to provide a
determination letter  to the effect that such Domtar U.S. Pension Plans are
qualified and exempt  from  Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the  Code, and no such determination letter has been
revoked nor, to the knowledge  of  Domtar, has revocation been threatened,
nor has any such Domtar U.S. Pension  Plan been amended since the date of its
most recent determination letter or  application therefor in any respect that
would reasonably be expected to  adversely affect its qualification or
materially increase its costs (other  than  any amendment to permit Newco
Employees (as defined in Section 4.10) to  participate in such plan) or
require "security" within the meaning of  Section 307 of ERISA. Each Domtar
Canadian Pension Plan (other  than any Domtar Canadian MEPP) has  been 
established and registered in accordance with the applicable requirements of 
the  ITA and applicable pension standards legislation and such registration
has  not  been revoked nor, to the knowledge of Domtar, has revocation been
threatened  by  the Canadian tax authorities or the applicable pension
regulatory  authorities.

 

 

(c)  No  Domtar  U.S. Pension Plan, other than any Domtar U.S. Pension
Plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3)
of ERISA (an " _Domtar  Multiemployer Pension Plan_ "),  had,  as of the
respective last annual valuation date for each such Domtar U.S.  Pension
Plan, an "unfunded benefit liability" (as such term is defined in  Section
4001(a)(18) of ERISA), based on actuarial assumptions that have  been
furnished to Weyerhaeuser and Spinco, except for instances which, either 
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be 
expected to have a Domtar Material Adverse Effect. None of the Domtar U.S. 
Pension Plans has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is
defined  in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412  of  the Code), whether or
not waived, except for instances which, either  individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be  expected to have a
Domtar Material Adverse Effect. Each Domtar Canadian Pension  Plan is fully
funded on a going concern and solvency basis pursuant to the  actuarial ****
assumptions  and methodologies set out in Section 3.11(c)  of the Domtar
Disclosure Letter. None of Domtar or any Domtar Subsidiary, and,  to the
knowledge of Domtar, no Domtar Employee and no trustee, fiduciary or 
administrator of any Domtar Benefit Plan or trust thereunder, has engaged in 
a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA 
or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary  responsibility
that would reasonably be expected to subject Domtar, any Domtar  Subsidiary
or any Domtar Employee to the tax or penalty on prohibited  transactions
imposed by such Section 4975 or to any liability under  Section 502(i) or
502(1) of ERISA, except to the extent that any such  taxes or penalties,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would  not  reasonably be
expected to have a Domtar Material Adverse Effect. None of such  Domtar
Benefit Plans and trusts has been terminated, nor has there been any 
"reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) with 
respect to any Domtar Benefit Plan during the last five years, except to the 
extent that any such reportable events, individually or in the aggregate,
have  not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Domtar Material
Adverse  Effect. Neither Domtar nor any Domtar Subsidiary has incurred a
"complete  withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (as such terms are defined
in  Sections 4203 and 4205, respectively, of ERISA) since the effective date
of  such Sections 4203 and 4205 with respect to any Domtar Multiemployer 
Pension Plan. Neither Domtar nor any Domtar Subsidiary contributes to or has 
any  liability under any multi-employer pension plan as defined under
applicable  Canadian federal or provincial pension standards legislation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d)  No  Domtar  U.S. Welfare Benefit Plan is unfunded or funded through a
"welfare benefits  fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the
Code). Each Domtar  U.S. Welfare Plan that is a "group health plan" (as such
term is defined in  Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code), complies with the
applicable requirements  of Section 4980B(f) of the Code. Each Domtar U.S.
Welfare Plan and each  Domtar Canadian Welfare Plan (in each case including
any such plan covering  retirees or other former employees) may be amended or
terminated without  material liability to Domtar and any Domtar Subsidiary on
or at any time after  the Effective Time. No Domtar U.S. Welfare Plan or
Domtar Canadian Welfare  Plan  provides post-retirement health or life
insurance benefits, except where the  cost thereof is borne entirely by the
former employee (or his or her eligible  dependents).

 

 

(e)  Neither  Domtar nor any person or entity that would be treated as a
single employer  with  Domtar for purposes of Section 414(b),  (c), (m) or
(o) of the Code would reasonably be expected to incur any Controlled  Group
Liability (as defined in this Section 3.11(e))  in an amount that would
reasonably be expected to have a Domtar Material Adverse  Effect. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Controlled  Group Liability_ " means  any
and all liabilities (i) under Title IV of ERISA, other than for payment  of 
premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ "),  (ii) 
under Section 302  or  4068(a) of ERISA, (iii) under Section 412(n)  or 
4971 of the Code, and (iv) for violation of the continuation coverage 
requirements of Section 601  _et_ _seq._   of ERISA  and Section 4980B 
of  the Code or the group health requirements of Sections 9801 _et_ _seq._  
of the  Code and Sections 701 _et_ _seq._   of  ERISA.

 

 

(f)  Other  than payments that may be made to the persons listed in Section
3.11(f) of  the Domtar Disclosure Letter (the " _Primary  Domtar Executives_
"),  no  amount or other entitlement that could be received (whether in cash
or property  or the vesting of property) as a result of the Transaction by
any officer,  director, manager or employee of Domtar or any Domtar
Subsidiary who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation  Section 1.280G-1) under any Domtar Benefit Plan, Domtar
Benefit Agreement  or other compensation arrangement would be characterized
as an "excess parachute  payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code) and no such  disqualified individual is entitled to receive any
additional payment  (including, without limitation, any tax gross up or other
payment) from Domtar,  any Domtar Subsidiary or any other person in the event
that the excise tax  required by Section 4999(a)  of the Code is imposed on
such disqualified individual. Section 3.11(f)  of the Domtar Disclosure
Letter sets forth (i) the Company's reasonable,  good faith estimates of the
maximum amount that could be paid to each Primary  Domtar Executive as a
result of the Transactions under any Domtar Benefit Plan,  Domtar Benefit
Agreement or other compensation arrangements and (ii) the "base amount" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each  Primary Domtar Executive
calculated as of the date of this  Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g)  The  execution and delivery of each Transaction Document do not, and
the consummation  of the Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof
and thereof will not  (i) entitle any Domtar Employee to severance,
termination, change in  control or similar pay and benefits, (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or  vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise)  of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or trigger any  other material obligation pursuant to, any
Domtar Benefit Plan or Domtar Benefit  Agreement, or (iii) result in any
breach or violation of, or a default  under, any Domtar Benefit Plan or
Domtar Benefit Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  3.12. _Labor  Matters._   Except  as set forth in Section 3.12 of
the Domtar Disclosure Letter:

 

 

(a)  There  are  no, and during the past three years there has not been
any, strikes, lockouts,  work stoppages, slowdowns or any other concerted
interference with normal  operations, stoppage or lockout pending or, to the
knowledge of Domtar,  threatened against or affecting any Domtar Employee,
Domtar or any Domtar  Subsidiary, except where such strikes, lockouts, work
stoppages, slowdowns,  or  any other concerted interference with normal
operations, stoppage or lockout,  individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be  expected to have a Domtar Material Adverse
Effect.

 

 

(b)  There  are  no formal or informal complaints, charges, claims or
grievances against Domtar  or any Domtar Subsidiary pending or, to the
knowledge of Domtar, threatened  to  be brought or filed with any
Governmental Entity, arbitrator or court based  on  or arising out of the
employment by Domtar or any Domtar Subsidiary of any  Domtar Employee.

 

 

(c)  Each  of  Domtar and the Domtar Subsidiaries is in compliance with
all laws, regulations,  rules and orders of all Governmental Entities
relating to the employment of  the  Domtar Employees, including without
limitation laws, regulations rules and  orders relating to wages, hours,
collective bargaining, discrimination, civil  rights, safety and health,
worker notification requirements, immigration,  workers' compensation,
layoffs and the collection and payment of withholding  Taxes and similar
Taxes, except where the failure to be in compliance,  individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be  expected to have a Domtar
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

SECTION  3.13. _Litigation._   There is  no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of Domtar, claims that have been asserted  against or affecting
Domtar or any Domtar Subsidiary (and Domtar is not aware  of  any basis for
any such Action or claim) that, individually or in the aggregate,  has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Domtar Material Adverse  Effect, nor
is there any Judgment outstanding against Domtar or any Domtar  Subsidiary
that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Domtar  Material
Adverse Effect. This Section 3.13 does not relate to Environmental  Claims,
which are the subject of Section 3.16.

all applicable Laws, including those relating to occupational  health and
safety, except for instances of non-compliance that, individually  and  in
the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have  a 
Domtar Material Adverse Effect. Neither Domtar nor any Domtar Subsidiary has 
received any written communication during the past two years from a
Governmental  Entity that alleges that Domtar or any Domtar Subsidiary is not
in compliance  in  any material respect with any applicable Law. This
Section 3.14 does not  relate to matters with respect to Taxes, which are the
subject of  Section 3.09, or Environmental Laws, which are the subject of 
Section 3.16.

 

 

SECTION  3.15. _Brokers._   No  broker, investment banker, financial

Inc. is entitled to any broker's, finder's,  financial advisor's or other
similar fee or commission in connection with the  Transactions based upon

The fees and expenses of JP Morgan and RBC Dominion Securities  Inc. will be
paid by Domtar.

of law; and

 

 

(vi) (A) neither  Domtar nor any Domtar Subsidiary has retained or assumed,

an exclusive license to any Domtar  Intellectual Property Rights, and (3) 
no  material license fees of any kind are currently required for the use by

Rights.  Notwithstanding any other representations in this Section 3.18(a),
Domtar makes  no representation with respect to whether patent applications
set  forth  in  Section  3.18(a) of the Domtar Disclosure Letter will be

infringe any claims of any third party's  patents.

(ii)  challenging the validity, ownership, patentability, enforceability, 
registrability or use by Domtar or any Domtar Subsidiary of any Domtar

maintained with reputable insurers in such  amounts and covering such risks
as are in accordance with normal industry  practice for companies engaged in

more than 90 days  for a cost of less than $75,000.

 

 

Each  of  the Domtar Material Agreements required to be set forth in Section
3.20 of  the Domtar Disclosure Letter or entered into after the date of this
Agreement  is  or will be in full force and effect (except to the extent any

Domtar Subsidiary has  violated any provisions of, or committed or failed to

constitute a default under  the  provisions of any Domtar Material
Agreement, except for violations or defaults  that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably  be  expected to have a
Domtar Material Adverse Effect. True, correct and complete  copies of each
written Domtar Material Agreement, and a summary of each oral  Domtar
Material Agreement, listed in Section 3.20 of the Domtar Disclosure  Letter
(including all written modifications and amendments thereto and waivers

Exchangeco will  possess immediately after the Distribution Date, all

necessary to enable it to own,  lease or otherwise hold its properties and
assets and to conduct the Newco  Business as presently conducted, other than
such franchises, licenses, permits,  authorizations and approvals the lack of
which, individually or in the  aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Newco  Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Weyerhaeuser, Weyerhaeuser Canada, Weyerhaeuser  Saskatchewan and the Spinco
Parties is duly qualified to do business in each  jurisdiction where the
nature of the Newco Business or the ownership or leasing  of the Newco Assets
or the Newco Canada Exchangeco Assets make such  qualification necessary or
the failure to so qualify has had or would reasonably  be expected to have a
Newco Material Adverse Effect. Weyerhaeuser, Weyerhaeuser  Canada,
Weyerhaeuser Saskatchewan and the Spinco Parties have delivered to  Domtar
true and complete copies of their articles of incorporation and by-laws,

employed in Canada (" _Newco  Canadian_ _Welfare  Plans_ ")  and  all

Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter,  a  description thereof), (ii) the most
recent annual information return with  respect to each Assumed Canadian Plan
(as defined in Section 6.09(g)(i))  (if any such return was required), (iii)
the most recent summary plan  description for each such Newco Benefit Plan

(b)  Each  Newco 401(k) Plan (as defined in Section 6.09(f)(i))  has been
the subject of determination letters from the IRS with respect to  all  Tax
Law changes with respect to which the IRS is currently willing to provide 
a  determination letter to the effect that such Newco 401(k) Plan is
qualified  and  exempt from Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a),  respectively, of the Code, and no such determination letter has been
revoked  nor, to the knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, has revocation been
threatened, nor  has  any such Newco 401(k) Plan been amended since the date
of its most recent  determination letter or application therefor in any
respect that would  reasonably be expected to adversely affect its
qualification.  With  respect to any Newco Employee, the Newco 401(k) Plans,
the Newco Benefit Plans  (other than the Excluded Benefit Plans and any Newco
Canadian MEPP) and the  Newco Benefit Agreements have been administered in
compliance with their terms,  other than instances of non-compliance that,
either individually or in the  aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Newco  Material Adverse Effect. Each Assumed
Canadian Plan has been established and  registered in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the ITA and  applicable pension standards
legislation and such registration has not been  revoked nor, to the knowledge
of Weyerhaeuser, has revocation been threatened  by  the Canadian tax
authorities or the applicable pension regulatory authorities.  Each Assumed
Canadian Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms  and
applicable Law, other than instances of non-compliance that, either 
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be 
expected to have a Newco Material Adverse Effect. Neither Weyerhaeuser nor 
any  Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary contributes to or has any liability under any 
multi-employer pension plan (as defined under applicable Canadian federal or 
provincial pension standards legislation).

 

 

(c)  Each  Assumed Canadian Plan is fully-funded on a going-concern and
solvency basis  pursuant to the actuarial assumptions and methodologies set
out in  Section 4.11(c) of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(d)  No  Newco  U.S. Welfare Plan is funded or is insured through a third
party.

 

 

(e)  None  of  Weyerhaeuser or any person or entity that would be treated
as a single employer  with Weyerhaeuser for purposes of Section 414(b), 
(c), (m) or (o) of the Code would reasonably be expected to incur any
Controlled  Group Liability in an amount that would reasonably be expected to
have a Newco  Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(f)  No  Newco  U.S. Welfare Plan or Newco Canadian Welfare Plan provides
post-retirement health  or life insurance benefits, except where the cost
thereof is borne entirely  by  the former employee (or his or her eligible
dependents).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g)  The  execution and delivery of each Transaction Document does not, and
the  consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof
and  thereof will not, (i) entitle any Newco Employee to severance,
termination,  change in control or similar pay and benefits, (ii) accelerate
the time of  payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust  or  otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase
the amount payable or  trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any
Newco Benefit Plan or  Newco Benefit Agreement, or (iii) result in any breach
or violation of, or  a default under, any Newco Benefit Plan or Newco Benefit
Agreement.

 

 

(h)  No  amount  or other entitlement that could be received (whether in
cash or property or  the  vesting of property) as a result of the
Transaction by any Transferred Employee  (as defined in Section 6.09) who is
a "disqualified individual" (as such  term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.280G-1) under any Newco  Benefit Plan, Newco Benefit Agreement or
other compensation arrangement would  be  characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as defined in  Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) and no
such disqualified individual is  entitled to receive any additional payment
(including, without limitation,  any  tax gross up or other payment) from
Newco, any Spinco Party or any other person  in the event that the excise tax
required by Section 4999(a)  of the Code is imposed on such disqualified
individual.

 

 

SECTION  4.12. _Labor  Matters._ Except as set forth in Section 4.12 of the
Weyerhaeuser  Disclosure Letter:

 

 

(a)  There  are  no, and during the past three years there have not been

interference with normal  operations, stoppage or lockout pending, or, to the
knowledge of Weyerhaeuser,  threatened against or affecting any Newco
Employee, Newco Assets, Newco Canada  Exchangeco Assets, Newco or any Newco
Subsidiary, except where such strikes,  lockouts, work stoppages, slowdowns,
or any other concerted interference with  normal operations, stoppage or
lockout, individually or in the aggregate, have  not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Newco Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

(b)  There  are  no formal or informal complaints, charges, claims or
grievances against  Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary pending, or,
to the knowledge of  Weyerhaeuser, threatened to be brought or filed with any

employment by Weyerhaeuser  or  any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary of any Newco
Employee.

 

 

(c)  Weyerhaeuser  and each Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary is in compliance with
all laws, regulations,  rules and orders of all Governmental Entities
relating to the employment of  the  Newco Employees, including without

collective bargaining, discrimination, civil rights,  safety and health,
worker notification requirements, immigration, workers' compensation, layoffs
and the collection and payment of withholding Taxes and  similar Taxes,
except where the failure to be in compliance, individually or  in  the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have an 
Newco  Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  4.13. _Litigation._   There is  no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, claims that have been  asserted against or
affecting Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary  (including the Spinco
Parties) relating to the Newco Business (and Weyerhaeuser  is not aware of
any basis for any such Action or claim) that, individually  or in  the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Newco Material 
Adverse Effect, nor is there any Judgment outstanding against Weyerhaeuser 
or  any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary (including the Spinco Parties) relating to

the past two years from a Governmental  Entity that alleges that Weyerhaeuser
or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary is not  in  compliance in any material
respect with any applicable Law. This  Section 4.14 does not relate to
matters with respect to Taxes, which are  the subject of Section 4.09, or
Environmental Laws, which are the subject  of Section 4.16.

 

 

SECTION  4.15. _Brokers._   No  broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other person, other than Morgan  Stanley and Co., Inc., is entitled
to any broker's, finder's, financial  advisor's or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the Transactions  based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of Weyerhaeuser, Spinco or Newco.  The fees and expenses of
Morgan Stanley and Co., Inc. will be paid by  Weyerhaeuser; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that,  subject to Section 6.11, in the event the Transactions
are consummated,  Spinco shall reimburse Weyerhaeuser for such fees and
reasonably documented  out-of-pocket expenses of Morgan Stanley and Co., Inc.
incurred in connection  with the Transactions.

SECTION  4.18. _Intellectual  Property._   (a) Section  4.18(a) of the
Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter sets forth all Registered  Intellectual
Property that  is owned  by  Weyerhaeuser and used primarily in the
conduct of the Newco Business as  currently conducted except for Excluded
Assets.  Except  for the Intellectual Property Rights that are the subject
of claims set forth in  Section 4.18(b) of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter
(to the extent of such  claims), all Intellectual Property Rights that are
material to the Newco  Business as currently conducted will be, to the extent
owned by or licensed  to  Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary,
owned  by,  licensed to or sublicensed to Newco or the Newco Subsidiaries
after giving  effect to the Intellectual Property License Agreement, the

Rights, and (3)  no  material license fees of any kind are currently
required for the use by  Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary of any

representations in this Section 4.18(a), Weyerhaeuser  makes no
representation with respect to whether patent applications set  forth  in 
Section  4.18(a) of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter will be issued by the
applicable  governmental  authority  or if  issued, whether practicing any
of the claims in any such patents infringes  or  will infringe any claims of
any third party's patents.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)  Except  as  set forth in Section 4.18(b) of the Weyerhaeuser
Disclosure Letter,  no  claims  are pending or, to the knowledge of 
Newco,  have been asserted, as of the date of this Agreement against

that Weyerhaeuser or any  Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary is infringing or has
infringed any Intellectual Property  Right in the operation  or  conduct 
of the Newco  Business  as currently conducted or  (ii)  challenging the
validity, ownership, patentability, enforceability,  registrability or use by

Intellectual Property Rights.  As of  the date of this Agreement, to the
knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, no person is  infringing or misappropriating the
rights of Weyerhaeuser  or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary  with  respect to
any Weyerhaeuser Intellectual Property Rights.

 

 

(c)  There  are  no unpaid maintenance or renewal fees currently overdue
for any Registered  Intellectual Property  set  forth or required to be set
forth in Section 4.18(a) of the Weyerhaeuser  Disclosure Letter,  nor  have
any material applications or registrations therefor lapsed or been 
abandoned, canceled, or expired other than in the ordinary course of 
business.

 

 

(d)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents,  Weyerhaeuser and any other member of the
Weyerhaeuser Group do not make any  representation or warranty of any kind
whatsoever, express or implied, with  respect to the "Willamette" name, which
shall be transferred on an "as is, where  is" basis, and all implied
warranties of ownership, validity, enforceability,  non-infringement or
otherwise are hereby expressly disclaimed.

 

 

SECTION  4.19. _Insurance._   All of  the material insurance policies held

maintained with reputable insurers in such amounts  and covering such risks
as are in accordance with normal industry practice  for  companies engaged
in a business similar to the Newco Business, and (ii) are  in full force and
effect and all premiums due thereon have been paid.  Weyerhaeuser and such
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries have complied with the terms  and  provisions of
such insurance policies, except for any non-compliance that,  individually or
in the aggregate, has not had or would not reasonably be  expected to have a
Newco Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

SECTION  4.20. _Material  Agreements._   Section  4.20 of the
Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all the Newco  Material
Agreements as of the date of this Agreement. For the purpose of this 
Agreement, the term " _Newco  Material Agreements_ " means  any of the
following agreements, arrangements, commitments or understandings,  whether
or not in writing, to which Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary, 
with respect to the Newco Business only, is a party:

 

 

(a) any  "material contract" (as defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K
promulgated  under the Securities Act) (the term "material contract" to be
applied as if  Newco were a separate company for purposes of this Section 
4.20(a));

 

 

(b) any  non-competition agreement or any other agreement, arrangement,
commitment or  understanding that materially limits Weyerhaeuser and the
Weyerhaeuser  Subsidiaries from conducting and engaging in the Newco
Business, or that would  reasonably be expected to materially limit any Newco
Party from conducting  and  engaging in the Newco Business after the
Effective Time;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) any  agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding with respect to
any  partnership, joint venture or strategic alliance material to the Newco 
Business;

the terms  of indebtedness, or guarantees of indebtedness, of Newco or any
Newco Subsidiary  after the Effective Time; and

 

 

(e) any  agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding (other than any
short-term  purchase agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding
entered into in  the  ordinary course of business) that provides for annual
payments in excess of  $1,000,000 and that is terminable by notice of not
more than 90 days for a  cost of less than $75,000.

 

 

Each  of  the Newco Material Agreements required to be set forth in Section
4.20 of  the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter or entered into after the date of
this  Agreement is or will be in full force and effect (except to the extent
any  of  them expires in accordance with its terms), and neither
Weyerhaeuser nor any  Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary has violated any provisions of,
or committed or failed  to perform any act that, with or without notice,
lapse of time, or both, would  constitute a default under the provisions of
any Newco Material Agreement,  except for violations or defaults that,
individually or in the aggregate, have  not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Newco Material Adverse  Effect. True, correct and complete
copies of each written Newco Material  Agreement (and a summary of each oral
Newco Material Agreement) listed in  Section 4.20 of the Weyerhaeuser
Disclosure Letter (including all written  modifications and amendments
thereto and waivers thereunder) have been made  available to Domtar.

 

 

SECTION  4.21. _Affiliate  Transactions._   Section 4.21 of the
Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all  contracts,
agreements, arrangements, commitments or understandings, whether  or  not
entered into in the ordinary course of business, to or by which Weyerhaeuser 
or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary (other than the Spinco Parties), on the one 
hand,  and any Spinco Party, on the other hand, are a party or are bound, and
that  are  in effect on the date of this Agreement and shall, or are
reasonably expected  to, be in effect on or after the Effective Time other
than this Agreement and  the other Transaction Documents.

 

 

SECTION  4.22. _Opinion  of Weyerhaeuser Financial Advisor._  
Weyerhaeuser, as the sole stockholder of Spinco, has received the written 
opinion of Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated, to the effect that, as of the 
date of such opinion, the consideration to be received by the holders of 
Weyerhaeuser Common Stock pursuant to the Transactions is fair from a
financial  point of view to such holders. Weyerhaeuser has delivered a copy
of such opinion  to Domtar for informational purposes only.

 

 

SECTION  4.23. _Real  Estate._   (a)  Section 4.23(a) of the Weyerhaeuser
Disclosure Letter lists all real property  (in each case, together with the
address, if any) that is, or following the  Contribution and the other
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will  be,  owned by Newco and
the Newco Subsidiaries and that is material in the operation  or conduct of
the Newco Business (the " _Newco  Owned Real Property_ ").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)  Section  4.23(b) of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter lists all real
property (in each  case, together with the address, if any) in which Newco or
any of the Newco  Subsidiaries will hold a leasehold interest following the
Contribution and  the  other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

_Newco  Leased Real Property_ ").  Weyerhaeuser has made available to Domtar
a true and complete copy of each  material lease agreement under which the
Newco Leased Real Property is held.  There is no material default under any
such lease agreement by Weyerhaeuser  or  any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary or, to
the knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, by any other  party thereto that has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Newco  Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

SECTION  4.24. _Sufficiency  of Assets._   At the  Effective Time, the
Newco Assets, taken together with the Newco Canada  Exchangeco Assets and the
services available from Weyerhaeuser or any  Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary under
the Transition Services Agreement, the  intellectual property rights licensed
under the Intellectual Property License  Agreement and the goods and services
provided under the Fiber Supply Agreements,  the Site Services Agreements,
the other Transaction Documents and the  arrangements contemplated by
Sections 2.09 and 2.10 of the Contribution and  Distribution Agreement, will
constitute those assets, services and intellectual  property rights
reasonably required to operate the Newco Business in all  material respects
as currently conducted and as proposed to be conducted in  accordance with
Section 5.01(b). Nothing in this Section 4.24 shall be  construed to
constitute a representation or warranty as to title to the Newco  Assets, the
Newco Exchangeco Assets or the Retained Licensed Intellectual  Property
licensed under the Intellectual Property License Agreement, which  is  the
subject of Sections 4.17 and 4.18.

_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  with respect to the Canadian Securities
Legislation and United States "Blue Sky" qualifications none of Weyerhaeuser,
Spinco nor Domtar shall be required to  register or qualify as a foreign
corporation or to take any action that would  subject it to service of
process in any jurisdiction where such entity is not  now so subject, except
as to matters and transactions arising solely from the  offer and conversion
of the Exchangeable Shares and the issuance of the shares  of Spinco Common
Stock; and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51

the foregoing provisions of this  Section 6.04, and each covenants that no
information furnished by it (to  its knowledge in the case of information
concerning its shareholders) in  connection with such actions or otherwise in
connection with the consummation  of  the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will contain any untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be  stated in any such document or
necessary in order to make any information so  furnished for use in any such
document not misleading in the light of the  circumstances in which it is
furnished.

 

 

(c)  Weyerhaeuser,  Spinco and Domtar shall each promptly notify the other
if at any time before  or  after the Effective Time it becomes aware that
the Domtar Circular, the  Weyerhaeuser Canada Circular or an application for
an order, filing or a  registration statement described in Section 6.02 or
6.03 contains any  untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required  to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein  not  misleading in light of the circumstances
in which they are made, or that  otherwise requires an amendment or
supplement to the Domtar Circular, the  Weyerhaeuser Canada Circular or such
application, filing or registration  statement. In any such event, the Spinco
Parties and Domtar shall cooperate  in  the preparation of a supplement or
amendment to the Domtar Circular, the  Weyerhaeuser Canada Circular or such
other document, as required and as the  case  may be, and, if required,

or omit  to  state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the  statements contained therein not misleading in light
of the circumstances in  which they are made (other than with respect to any
information relating to  and  provided by Domtar or any third party that is
not an affiliate of Spinco) and  Domtar shall provide all information
regarding it necessary to do  so.

SECTION  6.06. _Access  to Information; Confidentiality._   Each of 
Weyerhaeuser, Newco and Domtar shall, and shall cause each of its respective 
subsidiaries to (in the case of Weyerhaeuser, with respect to the Newco
Business  only), afford to the other party and to the officers, employees,
accountants,  counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of such
other party,  reasonable access during normal business hours during the
period prior to the  Effective Time to all their respective properties,
plants, books, contracts,  commitments, personnel and records and, during
such period, each of Weyerhaeuser  (with respect to the Newco Business only)
and Domtar shall, and shall cause  each  of its respective subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to the other party  (a) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other  document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of Canadian  Securities Legislation or of U.S.
Federal or state securities laws and  (b) to the extent permitted by Law, all
other information concerning its  business, properties and personnel as such
other party may reasonably request;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that 
either party may withhold (i) any documents (or portions thereof) or 
information that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with 
a  third party, (ii) any document (or portions thereof) or information which
may  constitute privileged attorney-client communications or attorney work
product  and the transfer of which, or the provision of access to which, as
reasonably  determined by such party's counsel, constitutes a waiver of any
such privilege,  or (iii) any documents (or portions thereof) or information
relating  to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive if the
exchange of such  documents (or portions thereof) or information, as
determined by such party's  counsel, might reasonably result in antitrust
difficulties for such party or  any  of its affiliates. If any material is
withheld by such party pursuant to the  proviso to the preceding sentence,
such party shall inform the other party  as to  the general nature of what
is being withheld. Upon its execution of a work  paper  access letter in
customary form, each of Domtar and Weyerhaeuser shall be  afforded reasonable
access by the other party during normal business hours  during the period
prior to the Effective Time to all information used by such  other party in
the preparation of Audited Newco Financial Statements or, as  applicable, the
Audited Domtar Financial Statements (in the case of the Audited  Newco
Financial Statements, when such financial statements become available).  All
information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.06 shall be held by  the
parties as Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement, 
dated as of August 8, 2005, between Weyerhaeuser and Domtar (the "
_Confidentiality  Agreement_ "))  and  shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement.

cooperate  with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable  to  consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable,  the  Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all
necessary or advisable  actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental  Entities and the making of all necessary or

any stay or temporary restraining order entered by  any  court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (iv) the  execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate  the  Transactions and
to fully carry out the purposes of the Transaction Documents.  In connection
with and without limiting the foregoing, Domtar shall  (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that the take-over provisions of  the Canadian Securities
Legislation and the state takeover statutes or similar  statutes or
regulations are not and do not become applicable to any Transaction  or this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document and (ii) if the  Canadian
Securities Legislation or any state takeover statute or similar statute  or
regulation becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement or any 
other Transaction Document, take all action necessary to ensure that the 
Arrangement and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as 
practicable on the terms contemplated by the Transaction Documents. Each of 
the  parties hereto shall keep the other parties reasonably informed of its
progress  in obtaining any necessary or advisable Consents and Governmental

(b)  Domtar  shall give prompt notice to Weyerhaeuser and Newco, and
Weyerhaeuser and Newco  shall give prompt notice to Domtar of (i) any
representation or warranty  made by it contained in any Transaction Document
that is qualified as to  materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any
respect or any such  representation or warranty that is not so qualified
becoming untrue or  inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by
it to comply with  or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition
or agreement to  be  complied with or satisfied by it under any Transaction
Document; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or  agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties  under the
Transaction Documents.

 

 

(c)  Nothing  in Section 6.07(a) shall require any of the parties or any of
their  respective subsidiaries to  (i) pay any consideration to any third
party from whom any consents,  approvals, or waivers are requested, other
than filing fees paid to Governmental  Entities, or (ii)  dispose  of any
of its assets or to limit its freedom of action with respect to any  of  its
businesses, or to consent to any disposition of any assets or limits on 
its  freedom of action with respect to any of its businesses, or to commit or
agree  to any of the foregoing in order to obtain any consents, approvals,
permits  or  authorizations or to remove any impediments to the Transactions
relating to  the  Competition Act, the HSR Act, the Investment Canada Act or
other antitrust,  competition or pre-merger notification, trade regulation
law, regulation or  order (" _Review  Laws_ ")  or to  avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary  restraining order
or other order in any suit or proceeding relating to Review  Laws, other than
dispositions, limitations, consents or commitments that  individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be  expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Newco Business and Domtar  Business, taken as
a whole.

that may be required for the Transactions and  any  supplemental information
requested in connection therewith pursuant to the  HSR  Act, and (ii) make
such other filings as promptly as practicable as are  necessary under the
Review Laws and shall promptly provide any supplemental  information
requested by applicable Governmental Entities relating thereto.  No  party
shall include in any such filing, notification or report form referred  to 
in clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence a request for 
early termination or acceleration of any applicable waiting periods without 
the  prior written consent of the other parties. Any such filing,
notification and  report form and supplemental information shall be in
substantial compliance  with  the requirements of the HSR Act and other
Review Laws. Each of Domtar,  Weyerhaeuser and the Spinco Parties shall
furnish to the other such necessary  information and reasonable assistance as
the other may reasonably request in  connection with their preparation of any
filing or submission that is necessary  under the HSR Act and other Review
Laws. Each of Domtar, Weyerhaeuser and the  Spinco Parties shall keep each
other apprised of the status of any  communications with, and any inquiries
or requests for additional information  from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other
applicable Governmental Entity and shall  comply with any such inquiry or

efforts to cooperate  with  Spinco and Newco in connection with the
financing contemplated by the New Debt  Commitment Letter, including using
(and causing its subsidiaries to use)  reasonable best efforts to satisfy all
conditions precedent to be satisfied  by  the Spinco Parties in the New Debt
Commitment Letter, providing information  to  and permitting the financing

Domtar Business, respectively, participating in meetings  with prospective
investors and participating (and permitting members of its  senior management
to participate) in bank meetings in connection with the  financing,
participating in meetings with rating agencies, participating in  drafting
sessions related to the offering materials for the debt financing 
contemplated by the New Debt Commitment Letter, causing the present and
former  independent accountants for Weyerhaeuser and Domtar, respectively,
to  participate in drafting sessions related to the offering materials for
the  debt  financing contemplated by the New Debt Commitment Letter and

date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors  of Weyerhaeuser (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the  Weyerhaeuser Stock Plans) and
the Board of Directors of Spinco shall adopt  such  resolutions or take such
other actions as may be required to effect the  following:

 

 

(i) prior  to  the Contribution, each Newco Employee that  holds a
Weyerhaeuser equity award that is described in clauses (ii), (iii),  (iv) 
or (v) below (each, a " _Weyerhaeuser  Equity Award_ ")  shall  be given
the opportunity to elect, by a date prior to the Measurement Date  as 
determined by Weyerhaeuser, to (A) continue to hold all of such Newco 
Employee's Weyerhaeuser Equity Awards in accordance with their terms, or  (B)
surrender all of such Newco Employee's Weyerhaeuser Equity Awards in 
exchange for substituted Spinco equity awards as set forth in clauses (ii), 
(iii), (iv) and (v) below (any Newco Employee who elects to surrender all of 
such Newco Employee's Weyerhaeuser Equity Awards as set forth in this clause 
(B), a " _Rollover  Employee_ ");

 

 

(ii) immediately  prior to the Distribution, each outstanding option to
acquire shares of  Weyerhaeuser Common Stock granted under the Weyerhaeuser
Stock Plans held by  a  Rollover Employee (whether vested or unvested)
(each, a " _Weyerhaeuser  Option_ ")  shall  be surrendered to Weyerhaeuser
in exchange for an option granted by Spinco  to  acquire, on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under the  Weyerhaeuser Option, a number of
shares of Spinco Common Stock (rounded down  to  the nearest whole share),
determined by multiplying the number of shares of  Weyerhaeuser Common Stock
subject to such Weyerhaeuser Option by the Option  Exchange Ratio (as defined
in this Section 6.08(a)), at an exercise price per  share of Spinco Common
Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to  (A)  the per share
exercise price for the shares of Weyerhaeuser Common Stock  otherwise
purchasable pursuant to such Weyerhaeuser Option divided by (B) the  Option
Exchange Ratio (each, as so granted, a " _Substituted  Spinco Option_ ");

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) any  Weyerhaeuser Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock
option" (as  defined in Section 422 of the Code), that may not be exchanged
in the manner  described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 6.08(a) and
that remains  an incentive stock option, shall be adjusted in accordance with
the requirements  of Section 424 of the Code in a manner that most closely
produces the economic  results obtained with respect to other Substituted
Spinco Options (it being  understood that it is the intention of the parties
hereto that Substituted  Spinco Options so granted by Spinco qualify, to the
fullest extent permissible,  as "incentive stock options" (as defined in
Section 422 of the Code), to the  extent that such Weyerhaeuser Options
qualified as "incentive stock options" immediately prior to the
Contribution);

 

 

(iv) immediately  prior to the Distribution, each outstanding stock
appreciation right with  respect to Weyerhaeuser Common Stock granted under
the Weyerhaeuser Stock Plans  held by a Rollover Employee (whether vested or
unvested) (each, a " _Weyerhaeuser  SAR_ ")  shall  be surrendered to
Weyerhaeuser in exchange for a stock appreciation right  granted by Spinco,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under  the  Weyerhaeuser
SAR, with respect to the number of shares of Spinco Common Stock  (rounded
down to the nearest whole share), determined by multiplying the number  of
shares of Weyerhaeuser Common Stock subject to such Weyerhaeuser SAR by 
the  Option Exchange Ratio, at an appreciation base price per share of Spinco
Common  Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the per
share  appreciation base price for the shares of Weyerhaeuser Common Stock
subject  to  such Weyerhaeuser SAR divided by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio
(each, as so  granted, a " _Substituted  Spinco SAR_ ");  and

 

 

(v) immediately  prior to the Distribution, each outstanding grant of
restricted stock units  with  respect to Weyerhaeuser Common Stock granted
under the Weyerhaeuser Stock Plans  held by a Rollover Employee (each, a "
_Weyerhaeuser  RSU_ ")  shall  be surrendered to Weyerhaeuser in exchange
for a grant of restricted stock  units  by Spinco, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the  Weyerhaeuser RSU, with respect to
the number of shares of Spinco Common Stock  (rounded down to the nearest
whole share), determined by multiplying the number  of shares of Weyerhaeuser
Common Stock subject to such Weyerhaeuser RSU by  the  Option Exchange Ratio
(each, as so granted, a " _Substituted  Spinco RSU_ ").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For  purposes of this Section 6.08(a), the following definitions shall

which is the Average Spinco  Distribution Price.

 

 

" _Average  Weyerhaeuser Pre-Distribution Price_ " shall  mean the volume
weighted average (rounded to the nearest 1/10,000) of the  trading prices of
the Weyerhaeuser Common Stock on the NYSE as reported by  Bloomberg Financial
Markets (or such other source as the parties shall agree  in  writing) for
the last trading day immediately prior to (i) the date on which  the 
Weyerhaeuser Common Stock begins to trade ex-dividend with respect to the 
Distribution (if the Distribution is effected in whole as a pro rata
dividend)  or (ii) the Distribution Date (if the Distribution is effected in
whole or  in  part as an exchange offer).

 

 

" _Average  Spinco Distribution Price_ " shall  mean the volume weighted
average (rounded to the nearest 1/10,000) of the  trading prices of the
Domtar Common Shares on the NYSE as reported by Bloomberg  Financial Markets
(or such other source as the parties shall agree in writing)  for the last
trading day immediately prior to the Distribution Date. 

 

 

(b)  Subject  to the adjustments required by Section 6.08(a) after giving
effect to the  Transactions,  immediately following the Distribution, Spinco
shall assume the Substituted  Spinco Options, Substituted Spinco SARs and
Substituted Spinco RSUs, with the  result that all obligations of Spinco
under the stock plans of Spinco (the  " _Spinco  Stock Plans_ ")  with 
respect to Substituted Spinco Options, Substituted Spinco SARs and
Substituted  Spinco RSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Distribution,
shall be  obligations of Spinco following the Distribution. Notwithstanding
the foregoing,  Spinco may grant the Substituted Spinco Options, Substituted
Spinco SARs and  Substituted Spinco RSUs under an existing or newly
established equity incentive  plan of Spinco.

 

 

(c)  As  soon  as reasonably practicable after the Distribution, Spinco
shall deliver to the  holders of Substituted Spinco Options,  Substituted
Spinco SARs and Substituted Spinco RSUs appropriate notices setting  forth

Substituted Spinco SARs and Substituted Spinco RSUs and that such
Substituted  Spinco Options, Substituted Spinco SARs and Substituted Spinco

executed notice of exercise  to Spinco, together with the consideration
therefor and any applicable Canadian  or U.S. Federal withholding tax
information required in accordance with the  related Weyerhaeuser Stock Plan.

SECTION  6.09. _New  Benefit Plans._   (a)  _General._   (i) For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Transferred  Employee_ " shall 
refer to each Newco Employee who, at the Effective Time, is employed with
Newco  or its subsidiaries (including any individuals who are not actively at
work  on  the Distribution Date due to vacation, holiday, illness, jury
duty, bereavement  leave or other authorized leave of absence, including,
subject to  Section 6.09(a)(ii) short-term disability leave,  long-term
disability leave or, subject to Section 6.09(a)(iii),  workers'
compensation).  The  parties hereto intend that Transferred Employees shall
have continuous and  uninterrupted employment immediately before and
immediately after the Effective  Time, and that for purposes of any severance
or termination benefit plan,  program, policy, agreement or arrangement of
Weyerhaeuser, Spinco, Newco, Domtar  or any of their respective subsidiaries
or affiliates, the Transactions  contemplated by the Transaction Documents
shall not constitute a severance  of  employment of any Transferred Employee
prior to or upon the consummation of  the  Transactions.

 

 

(ii) Newco  Employees who are on short-term or long-term disability leave ("
_Disabled  Newco Employees_ ")  other  than union employees at Dryden,
Ontario; Ear Falls, Ontario; Big River,  Saskatchewan; Prince Albert,
Saskatchewan and Kamloops, British Columbia will  not become Transferred
Employees until such time, if any, as they are determined  by the relevant
insurer to be no longer eligible for benefits under the  applicable
Weyerhaeuser short-term or long-term disability plan and present  themselves
for re-employment, at which time any such employee shall be offered 
continuing employment, to the extent such employee is able to return to 
employment (including with any reasonable accommodation), with Newco on the 
terms and conditions generally applicable to Transferred Employees under
this  Section 6.09. Prior to such time, Weyerhaeuser shall retain all
liability with  respect to providing short-term and long-term disability
benefits to Disabled  Newco Employees to the extent the Disabled Newco
Employees are eligible to  receive such benefits.  Disabled  Newco
Employees who are union employees at Dryden, Ontario; Ear Falls, Ontario; 
Big River, Saskatchewan; Prince Albert, Saskatchewan and Kamloops, British 
Columbia will become Transferred Employees pursuant to the Canadian Purchase 
Agreement but continue to receive short-term and long-term disability
benefits  under Weyerhaeuser benefit plans for so long as they are eligible
to receive  such benefits under such plans, provided  that  Newco fully and
promptly reimburses Weyerhaeuser for all costs incurred in  allowing for such
continued participation in such Weyerhaeuser benefit plans  and  that Newco
makes all reasonable efforts, including accommodation, to allow  such 
employees to return to active employment.

(iii) With  respect to each of the functions set forth on Schedule 2.11(a)(v)
to the  Contribution and Distribution Agreement, Weyerhaeuser shall confer
with Domtar  in good faith to identify and determine the approach to filling
full time  equivalent positions (including new hires) with respect to
Weyerhaeuser  employees who are not exclusively engaged in the Newco Business
but are  currently performing the functions set forth on such Schedule
2.11(a)(v) so  that sufficient employees (both as to number and expertise)
shall be  (i) transferred from Weyerhaeuser to Newco or hired by Newco to
enable  Newco to operate the Newco Business from and after the Effective Time
in  substantially the same manner that it was operated prior to the Effective
Time  after giving effect to the services provided under the Transition
Services  Agreement and the Site Services Agreements, and (ii) retained by
Weyerhaeuser  to  enable Weyerhaeuser to operate the Weyerhaeuser Business
from and after the  Effective Time in the same manner that such business was
operated prior to  the  Effective Time. During the period commencing on the
90th day prior to the day  on  which the parties anticipate the Effective
Time will occur and ending on the  Closing Date, Domtar shall be permitted to
make presentations to and meet with  (A) the Newco Employees set forth in
Schedule 2.11(a)(i) to the  Contribution and Distribution Agreement, (B) the
Mill Employees other than  those set forth on Schedule 2.11(a)(ii) to the
Contribution and  Distribution Agreement, (C) each Newco Employee set forth

(D) the Forest Management Employees set forth in Schedule 2.11(a)(iv)  to the
Contribution and Distribution Agreement, and (E) the Newco Employees 
identified pursuant to the previous sentence with respect to the functions 
set  forth on Schedule 2.11(a)(v) to the Contribution and Distribution 
Agreement, in each case either individually or in groups and upon reasonable 
advance notice to Weyerhaeuser. Weyerhaeuser shall permit such Newco
Employees  to attend such meetings and Domtar shall cooperate with
Weyerhaeuser to minimize  any disruption or interference to any business
operations of Weyerhaeuser or  its  affiliates in the scheduling, location
or other conduct of any such meetings.  On  or about the 30th day prior to
the day on which the parties anticipate the  Effective Time will occur,
Weyerhaeuser shall update Schedules 2.11(a) and  2.11(d) to the Contribution
and Distribution Agreement with information  regarding which Newco Employees
listed thereon (i) have accepted offers of  employment by a Spinco Party,
(ii) have refused an offer of employment by  any Spinco Party, (iii) whose
employment by Weyerhaeuser, Spinco or any  affiliate of Weyerhaeuser or
Spinco has terminated for any reason, or  (iv) are on short-term or long-term
disability leave or other leave of  absence. The parties agree that (i) no
Newco Employee shall be required to  relocate from his or her primary office
location in connection with the transfer  of his or her employment to any
Spinco Party, (ii) no employee (other than  the  new hires referenced in the
first sentence of this Section 6.09(a)(iii)) who  is  not engaged in the
Newco Business will be a Transferred Employee, and (iii)  for  the period
commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on the Closing  Date, no
Newco Employee who is expected to become a Transferred Employee (other  than
any Newco Employee who refuses an offer of employment from a Spinco Party 
notwithstanding Weyerhaeuser's good faith compliance with this Section
6.09(a)  and Section 2.11(a) of the Contribution and Distribution Agreement)
will be  offered employment with Weyerhaeuser or any of its affiliates other
than a  Spinco Party. Newco Employees employed in the United States who are
absent  from  work and receiving workers compensation benefits related to
such absence  (" _U.S.  WC Newco Employees_ ")  will  not become
Transferred Employees until such time, if any, as they are determined  by the
relevant insurer to be able to return to employment and present  themselves
for re-employment, at which time any such employee shall be offered 
continuing employment, to the extent such employee is able to return to 
employment, with Newco on the terms and conditions generally applicable to 
Transferred Employees under this Section 6.09. Prior to such time,
Weyerhaeuser  shall retain all liability with respect to providing workers
compensation  benefits to U.S. WC Newco Employees to the extent the U.S. WC
Newco Employees  are eligible to receive such benefits.

 

 

(b)  _Prior  Service Credit._   From and  after the Effective Time, Newco
shall give or cause Newco to give each  Transferred Employee full credit for
all purposes (including for purposes of  eligibility to participate, early
retirement eligibility and early retirement  subsidies, vesting and, except
with respect to defined benefit pension plans,  benefit accrual) under any
employee benefit plans and arrangements provided,  maintained or contributed
to by Newco or any Newco Subsidiary (other than the  Assumed Canadian Plans),
for such Transferred Employee's service with  Weyerhaeuser and its
subsidiaries, and with any predecessor employer, to the  same extent
recognized by Weyerhaeuser and its subsidiaries and affiliates  immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(c)  _Establishment  of New Benefit Plans._ Effective  as of the Effective
Time, each Transferred Employee shall cease to participate  in any employee
benefit plan, arrangement or understanding (other than the  Assumed Canadian
Plans) that is maintained or sponsored by Weyerhaeuser or  any  of its
affiliates (other than Spinco, Newco or any Newco Subsidiary) (other  than 
as a former employee of Weyerhaeuser or any of its affiliates to the extent, 
if  any, permitted by the terms of such employee benefit plan, arrangement
or  understanding).  Effective immediately following the Effective Time,
Spinco shall establish,  or  cause Newco to establish, compensation and
benefit plans, programs and  arrangements for the benefit of the Transferred
Employees (collectively, " _New  Benefit Plans_ ")  that  provide benefits
that are substantially as favorable in the aggregate as such  plans, programs
and arrangements that were in effect for the benefit of the  Transferred
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided  that the 
arrangements set forth in Section 6.09(c) of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure 
Letter shall be implemented by Newco promptly following to the Effective
Time.  From and after the Effective Time, Spinco shall, or shall cause its
subsidiaries  (including Newco and Domtar) to, honor the liabilities,
obligations and  commitments under the Domtar Benefit Plans and the Domtar
Benefit Agreements  with respect to the Domtar Employees.

 

 

(d)  _Annual  Bonus for Year of Transactions._   Spinco  shall, or shall
cause its subsidiaries (including Newco and Domtar) to,  (i) assume all
liabilities, obligations and commitments with respect to the  Transferred
Employees under the applicable annual incentive plan or arrangement  of
Weyerhaeuser and its subsidiaries other than such liabilities, obligations 
and commitments arising out of services performed by the Transferred
Employees  during fiscal year 2006 and honor the liabilities, obligations and
commitments  with respect to the Domtar Employees under the applicable annual
incentive  plan  or arrangement of Domtar and its subsidiaries that relate
to any periods  commencing prior to and ending after the Effective Time, (ii)
maintain such  applicable plan or arrangement pursuant to its terms as in
effect as of the  Effective Time for such Transferred Employees and Domtar
Employees, subject  to  any modifications that are required in order to take
into account the impact,  if  any, of the Transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents on the  performance measures set forth in such
applicable plan or arrangement, with  respect to all performance periods
thereunder commencing prior to and ending  after the Effective Time, and
(iii) at the times prescribed by such  applicable plan or arrangement as in
effect as of the Effective Time, make  payments to the Transferred Employees
and the Domtar Employees in accordance  with the terms of such applicable
plan or arrangement as in effect as of the  Effective Time.

(e)  _Certain  Welfare Benefits Matters._   (i) With  respect to each New
Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA or  an  employee health or welfare plan which provides
benefits to Canadian employees  (collectively,  (" _New  Welfare Plans_
"),  Spinco shall, or shall cause Newco to, (A) waive all limitations as to 
pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods and actively-at-work 
requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable  to the Transferred Employees and their dependents and
beneficiaries under the  New Welfare Plans to the extent waived under the
applicable corresponding Newco  Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) provide each  Transferred Employee and his or her
eligible dependents and beneficiaries with  credit under New Welfare Plans
for any co-payments and deductibles paid under  corresponding Newco Benefit
Plans prior to the Effective Time in the calendar  year in which the
Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying any  applicable deductible
or out-of-pocket requirements  (and any  annual and lifetime maximums) 
under  any New Welfare Plans in which the Transferred Employees participate.
Spinco  shall also (A) honor, and cause Domtar to continue to honor, the 
participation elections of each Domtar Employee with respect to each Domtar 
U.S.  Welfare Plan and Domtar Canadian Welfare Plan as in effect as of the
Effective  Time and (B) if any Domtar Employee becomes a participant in a New
Welfare  Plan  or other welfare plan sponsored or maintained by Newco or any
of its affiliates  (other than a Domtar U.S. Welfare Plan or Domtar Canadian
Welfare Plan) during  the 12-month period following the Effective Time, (i)
waive all limitations  as  to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods and actively-at-work  requirements with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable  to participants and their dependents and
beneficiaries under such plan to the  extent waived under the applicable
corresponding Domtar U.S. Welfare Plan or  Domtar Canadian Welfare Plan and
(ii) provide such Domtar Employee and his  or  her eligible dependents and
beneficiaries with credit under such plan for any  co-payments and
deductibles paid under the corresponding Domtar Benefit Plan  in  the
calendar year in which such Domtar Employee becomes a participant in such 
plan for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket 
requirements (and any annual and lifetime maximums) under such  plan.

 

 

(ii) Effective  as of the Effective Time, Spinco shall, or shall cause Newco
to, assume all  obligations, liabilities and commitments of Weyerhaeuser and
its subsidiaries  to  Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents in
respect of health  insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985,  as  amended (" _COBRA_ "),  the  Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (" _HIPAA_ "),  Sections
601 _et_ _seq._   and  Sections 701 _et_ _seq._   of  ERISA, Section
4980B  and  Sections 9801 _et_ _seq._   of the  Code and applicable state
or similar laws.

 

 

(f)  _Tax-Qualified  Savings/401(k) Plan._   (i) In accordance with
Section 6.09(c),  effective not later than the Effective Time, Spinco or its
affiliates (including  Newco) shall have in effect one or more defined
contribution plans that include  a qualified cash or deferred arrangement
within the meaning of Section 401(k)  of  the Code (and a related trust
exempt from tax under Section 501(a)  of  the Code) (as applicable, the "
_New  401(k) Plan_ ").  Each  Transferred Employee participating in a Newco
Benefit Plan that is a defined  contribution plan that includes a qualified
cash or deferred arrangement within  the meaning of Section 401(k)  of  the
Code (the " _Newco  401(k) Plan_ ")  immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall become a participant in the  corresponding New 401(k) Plan as of the
Effective Time  and each  Transferred Employee shall be eligible to
participate in a New 401(k) Plan  as of  the Effective Time.

 

 

(ii) Spinco  shall, or shall cause Newco to, cause the New 401(k) Plan to
accept a "direct  rollover" to such New 401(k) Plan of the account balances
of each Transferred  Employee (including promissory notes evidencing all
outstanding loans) under  the  Newco 401(k) Plan in which such Transferred
Employee participates, if such  direct rollover is elected in accordance with
applicable Law by such Transferred  Employee.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g)  _Assumed  Canadian Plans._   (i) Weyerhaeuser shall cause to be
assigned and transferred to Newco Canada  Exchangeco pursuant to the Canadian
Purchase Agreement all rights, obligations  and liabilities of the applicable
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries with respect to  the  following Newco Canadian
Pension Plans: the Weyerhaeuser Saskatchewan Ltd.  Pension Plan for Hourly
Employees of the Prince Albert Pulp and Paper Division,  Saskatchewan, the
Big River Lumber Union Employees Pension Plan, the  Weyerhaeuser Company
Limited Pension Plan for Hourly Employees at Dryden,  Ontario and the
Weyerhaeuser Canada Ltd. Pension Plan for Hourly Employees  of  Ear Falls,
Ontario (collectively, " _Assumed  Canadian Plans_ ").  Spinco shall cause
Newco Canada Exchangeco to accept pursuant to the Canadian  Purchase
Agreement such assignment and transfer and assume all liabilities,  duties
and responsibilities required of it as the successor sponsor of the  Assumed
Canadian Plans in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable  laws. 
Weyerhaeuser shall cause to be done all things required of the applicable 
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries, and Spinco shall cause to be done all things
required  of Newco Canada Exchangeco, under applicable laws to establish
Newco Canada  Exchangeco as successor sponsor to the applicable Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiaries  under the terms of the Assumed Canadian Plans as provided
hereunder. Effective  as of the Canadian Asset Sale, Newco Canada Exchangeco
will be responsible  for  all costs and expenses related to the Assumed
Canadian Plans, including all  contributions required under the terms of such
plans or applicable Law in  respect of any funding deficiencies thereunder.

 

 

(ii) It  is  understood that assets held pursuant to funding agreements in
respect of the  Assumed Canadian Plans are invested in a master trust
arrangement maintained  by  the applicable Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary and, as
soon as practicable after the  Effective Time, such Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary
shall cause the interests held  by  the Assumed Canadian Plans in such
master trust to be redeemed or transferred  as  the case may be in cash or
in specie, as determined by the applicable  Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary in
consultation with Newco Canada Exchangeco. The  applicable Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary shall have no obligation to assign or  transfer to Newco Canada
Exchangeco or to any funding media held by Newco Canada  Exchangeco any
interest in the said master trust. Subject to the foregoing,  Newco shall
cause Newco Canada Exchangeco to establish a trust or trusts for  the 
purpose of assuming assets held under the Assumed Canadian Plans or to
assume  the trusts held under the Assumed Canadian Plans subject to the
consent of  the  trustee thereunder (which the applicable Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary shall use  reasonable best efforts to obtain) and provided any
trust to be assumed holds  no  interest in the aforesaid master trust at the
time it is assumed. Spinco agrees  that the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary shall be
entitled, but shall not be obligated,  to transfer the assets of the Assumed
Canadian Plans from the master trust  to a  short-term money market fund.
Subject to the direction and authorization of  Newco Canada Exchangeco and at
the expense of Newco Canada Exchangeco, the  applicable Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary shall continue to administer each Assumed  Canadian Plan until
effective control and direction of the Assumed Canadian  Plans is transferred
to Newco Canada Exchangeco, which the applicable  Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary
shall use reasonable best efforts to accomplish as  quickly as practicable.
For the avoidance of doubt, no Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary  shall be construed as
the agent of Newco Canada Exchangeco for this purpose.  The  applicable
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries' only responsibility in connection with the 
Assumed Canadian Plans from the Effective Time to the date effective control 
is  acquired by Newco Canada Exchangeco and all necessary approvals are
obtained  from the applicable Governmental Entity shall be to execute the
directions  of  Newco Canada Exchangeco. Newco Canada Exchangeco shall
indemnify and save  harmless each applicable Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary from and
against all damage,  liability, loss, expense or cost that each applicable
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary  incurs as a result of Newco Canada Exchangeco's
failure to provide directions or  authorizations to the applicable
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary or as a result of  the  applicable Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary's compliance with directions or  authorizations provided by Newco
Canada Exchangeco, in each case in connection  with the Assumed Canadian
Plans on or after the Effective Time. After effective  control is acquired by
Newco Canada Exchangeco and all necessary approvals  are  obtained from the
applicable Governmental Entity, the applicable Weyerhaeuser  Subsidiaries
shall have no further obligations or liabilities under any Assumed  Canadian
Plan or funding arrangement held thereunder and Newco Canada Exchangeco 
shall be responsible for all obligations, liabilities and commitments
relating  to such plans both before and after the Effective Time and in
respect of  Transferred Employees and any other person entitled to rights,
benefits or  payments under the Assumed Canadian Plans.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(h)  _Accrued  Vacation._   For  purposes of determining the number of
vacation days to which each Transferred  Employee shall be entitled, Spinco
shall, or shall cause Newco to, assume and  honor all vacation days
(regular,  supplemental or banked) accrued  or earned but not yet taken by
such Transferred Employee as of the Effective  Time. To the extent that a
Transferred Employee is entitled under any applicable  Law or any policy of
Weyerhaeuser or any of its subsidiaries to be paid for  any  vacation days
(regular,  supplemental or banked) accrued  or earned but not yet taken by
such Transferred Employee as of the Effective  Time, Spinco shall, or shall
cause Newco to, assume the liability for such  vacation days.

 

 

(i)  _Administration._   Following the date of this Agreement, the parties
hereto shall reasonably  cooperate in all matters reasonably necessary to
effect the transactions  contemplated by this Section 6.09,  including
exchanging information and data relating to workers' compensation,  employee
benefits and employee benefit plan coverages (except to the extent 
prohibited by applicable Law), and in obtaining any governmental approvals 
required hereunder.

 

 

(j)  _Collectively  Bargained Employees._   From and  after the Effective
Time, Spinco shall, or shall cause its affiliates (including  Newco) to,
comply in all material respects with the terms of all collective  bargaining
agreements (including all obligations to provide employee benefits  and/or to
contribute to any pension plans) that cover one or more Transferred 
Employees (each, a " _CBA_ ")  as in  effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time until such time as Spinco or  its  affiliates (including
Newco) negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement  or  agreements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.09,  Spinco
further agrees that the provisions of this Section 6.09 shall be  subject to
any applicable provisions of a CBA in respect of Transferred  Employees, to
the extent such provisions are inconsistent with or otherwise  in  conflict
with the provisions of any such CBA.

 

 

(k)  _Flexible  Spending Account Plans._   Effective as of the Effective
Time (or, with respect to a Newco Employee who  becomes a Transferred
Employee after the Effective Time, such later time that  such Newco Employee
becomes a Transferred Employee), Newco shall assume  liabilities and account
balances of the Weyerhaeuser Flexible Spending Account  Plan maintained in
the U.S. with respect to Transferred Employees and their  dependents ("
_U.S.  Flexible Spending Account Plans "_).  Effective as of the Effective
Time (or, with respect to a Newco Employee who  becomes a Transferred
Employee after the Effective Time, such later time that  such Newco Employee
becomes a Transferred Employee), Weyerhaeuser shall transfer  or cause to be
transferred to Newco an amount in cash equal to the excess,  if  any, of the
aggregate contributions for the plan year in which the Effective  Time occurs
(or, with respect to a Newco Employee who becomes a Transferred  Employee
after the Effective Time, the plan year in which such Newco Employee  becomes
a Transferred Employee (such year, the " _Transition  Year_ "))  of  all
Transferred Employees then participating in Weyerhaeuser's U.S. Flexible 
Spending Account Plan over the aggregate reimbursements for the plan year in 
which the Effective Time occurs (or, as applicable, the Transition Year) to 
all  Transferred Employees under such plan. Newco shall cause such amounts to
be  credited to each such employee's accounts under Newco's (or one of its 
affiliate's) corresponding U.S. Flexible Spending Account Plan, which shall
be  established and in effect for such employees as of the Effective Time,
and  all  claims for reimbursement which have not been paid as of the date
of the transfer  to Newco (or one of its affiliates) and credited under
Newco's (or one of its  affiliate's) U.S. Flexible Spending Account Plan
shall be paid pursuant to and  under the terms of Newco's (or one of its
affiliate's) U. S. Flexible Spending  Account Plan. In connection with such
transfer, Newco shall deem that such  employees' deferral elections made
under Weyerhaeuser's U.S. Flexible Spending  Account Plan for the plan year
in which the Closing occurs (or, as applicable,  the Transition Year) shall
continue in effect under Newco's (or one of its  affiliate's) U.S. Flexible
Spending Account Plan for the remainder of the plan  year in which the
Closing occurs (or, as applicable, the Transition  Year).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(l)  _Canadian  Health Spending Account._   Effective as of the Effective
Time (or with respect to a Newco Employee who  becomes a Transferred Employee
after the Effective Time, such later time that  such Newco Employee becomes a
Transferred Employee), Newco shall, under any  health spending account plan
or arrangement provided by Newco to Transferred  Employees employed in
Canada, recognize and give credit for all unused account  balances of such
Transferred Employees, which are maintained under the  applicable
Weyerhaeuser health spending account at that time.

 

 

(m)  _U.S.  Multiemployer Pension Plan._   (i)  Weyerhaeuser and Domtar
intend that the Transactions shall not result in a  complete or partial
withdrawal by Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary  from the
Multiemployer Pension Plan set forth in Section 4.11(a) of the  Weyerhaeuser
Disclosure Letter (the " _U.S.  MEPP_ ")  and  Weyerhaeuser and Domtar
shall reasonably cooperate to prevent the imposition  of  a withdrawal
liability by the U.S. MEPP in connection with the Transactions,  and,
effective as of the Closing, Newco shall assume Weyerhaeuser's obligations 
to make contributions to the U.S. MEPP.

 

 

(ii) In  the  event that the Transactions are deemed to constitute sale of
assets to an  unrelated party under Section 4204 of ERISA, then Weyerhaeuser,
Newco and Domtar  agree that, unless the PBGC waives the requirements of
Section 4204(a)(1)(B)  of  ERISA, if Domtar withdraws from the U.S. MEPP
with respect to the Newco  Employees within the first five plan years
beginning after the Closing and  does  not pay its liability to such U.S.
MEPP on account of such withdrawal,  Weyerhaeuser shall be secondarily liable
to such plan for any withdrawal  liability that Newco would have had to the
plan with respect to the Newco  Employees in the absence of Section 4204(a)
of ERISA, to the extent required  by  ERISA. Notwithstanding the provisions
of the preceding sentence and Section  4204  of ERISA, it is expressly
agreed that if Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser  Subsidiary incurs any
secondary withdrawal liability under the preceding  sentence, Newco shall
indemnify and hold them harmless from any and all losses  incurred by
Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary by reason of such  secondary
liability.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) Newco  may  seek, pursuant to PBGC Regulations §§ 4204.11 and 4204.13,
a variance from the  bond/escrow requirement of Section 4204(a)(1)(B) of
ERISA. Weyerhaeuser shall  cooperate with Newco in connection with Newco's
request for such variance, which  cooperation shall include: (x) if so
requested by Newco, timely and jointly  with  Newco notifying the U.S. MEPP
in writing, as contemplated by PBGC Regulation § 4204.11, of their intention
that the Transactions be covered by Section 4204  of  ERISA and (y)
providing Newco or the U.S. MEPP with such information that is  reasonably
available to Weyerhaeuser and that Domtar or the U.S. MEPP requests  in
connection with such request for such variance. If the U.S. MEPP determines 
that Newco's request does not qualify for a variance of the bond/escrow 
requirement, Newco shall provide the bond or escrow required under Section 
4204(a)(1)(B) within the time period set forth in PBGC Regulation §
4204.11(d),  provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed to restrict the
ability of  Newco  to seek a variance or exemption pursuant to PBGC
Regulations §§ 4204.21 and  4204.22.

 

 

SECTION  6.10. _Directors '  and Officers' Liability Insurance._ (a)  As
of the Effective Time, Spinco shall have in effect, at no expense to the 
beneficiaries, policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance with 
respect to claims arising from or related to facts  or  events which
occurred at, before or after the Effective Time. Such policies  will  be
comparable in coverage and amount to Weyerhaeuser directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy and to the Domtar directors' and
officers' liability  insurance policy in effect as of the date of this
Agreement.

 

 

(b)  Spinco  shall for a period of at least six years after the Effective
Time, indemnify  and  hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to,
all past and present  directors or officers of Domtar, Newco and their
respective subsidiaries, and  each individual who prior to the Effective Time
becomes a director or officer  of  Domtar, Newco and their respective
subsidiaries, to the maximum extent allowed  under applicable Law in respect
of acts or omissions that occurred at or prior  to the Effective Time and, in
the case of directors and officers of Newco,  related to the Newco Business
or in connection with any of the Transaction  Documents or the Transactions.

 

 

(c)  Spinco  shall maintain in effect for each of the applicable persons
referred to in  Section 6.10(b) for a period of at least six years after the
Effective Time  policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance of
at least the same  coverage and containing terms and conditions which are, in
the aggregate, no  less advantageous to the insured, as the current policies
of directors' and  officers' liability insurance maintained by Domtar or
Weyerhaeuser, with respect  to claims arising from acts or omissions that
occurred at or prior to the  Effective Time and, in the case of directors and
officers of Newco, related  to  the Newco Business or in connection with any
of the Transaction Documents or  the  Transactions.

SECTION  6.11. _Fees  and Expenses._   (a) All  fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid  by  the party
incurring such fees or expenses; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that in  the
event the Transactions are consummated, Spinco shall reimburse Weyerhaeuser, 
Weyerhaeuser Canada and Weyerhaeuser Saskatchewan for (i) all fees and 
expenses (including fees and expenses of financial institutions, legal

expenses of legal counsel,  title companies and fees and expenses incurred
with respect to efforts to obtain  any Consents and Governmental Approvals)
incurred in connection with the site  separations set forth in Section 6.05
of the Contribution and Distribution  Agreement, and (iii) up to an amount of
$28,000,000 of all fees and  expenses (including fees and expenses of
investment bankers, legal counsel,  auditors and environmental consultants
and fees and expenses incurred with  respect to efforts to obtain any
Consents or Governmental Approvals) incurred  in  connection with the
Transactions. This Section 6.11 does not relate to Transfer  Taxes, which are
the subject of Section 2.03 of the Tax Sharing  Agreement.

 

 

(b)  Following  the Closing, each of Weyerhaeuser and Spinco shall each be
responsible for  50%  of the capital expenditures and one-time start-up
expenses incurred by either  party in connection with the actions required to
separate the facilities of  Spinco and Weyerhaeuser as disclosed in Section
9.03 of the Weyerhaeuser  Disclosure Letter under the heading "Site Services
Agreements" (the " _Site  Separation Costs_ ").  Prior  to the Closing,
Weyerhaeuser and Domtar shall agree on the procedures to be  followed by
Weyerhaeuser and Spinco to determine the amount of and methods  of

SECTION  6.12. _Public  Announcements._   Weyerhaeuser and Newco, on the
one hand, and Domtar, on the other hand, shall  consult with each other and
shall mutually agree upon any press release or  other  public statements
with respect to the Transactions and shall not issue any  such  press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation  and 
agreement, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by 
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with the TSX or any U.S.
national  securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue
such press  release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable
best efforts  to consult in good faith with the other parties before issuing
any such press  release or making any such public announcement.

 

 

SECTION  6.13. _Transition  Services, Site Services and Other Agreements._
  Subject  to Section 7.01(h), on or prior to the Closing Date, the parties
shall negotiate  in good faith and enter into (i) the Transition Services
Agreement providing  for  services in accordance with the terms and subject
to the conditions in Exhibit  E, and (ii) the Fiber Supply Agreements and the
Site Services Agreements, in  each case providing for the goods and services
and in accordance with the terms  and subject to the conditions set forth in

SECTION  6.14. _Non-Solicitation  of Employees._   For a  period of two
years from the Effective Time, without the prior written consent  of Spinco,
Weyerhaeuser will not, and will not permit any affiliate of  Weyerhaeuser to,
directly or indirectly, employ or attempt to employ any  employee of Newco or
any Newco Subsidiary or solicit or induce any employee  of  Newco or any
Newco Subsidiary to terminate such person's employment with Newco  or such
Newco Subsidiary. For a period of two years from the Effective Time,  without
the prior written consent of Weyerhaeuser, Spinco will not, and will  not 
permit any affiliate of Spinco to, directly or indirectly, employ or attempt 
to  employ any employee of Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary or
solicit  or  induce any employee of Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary to terminate  such person's employment with Weyerhaeuser or such
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary. For  the purposes of this Section 6.14, the
placement of "help wanted" advertisements, postings on internet job sites and
searches by employment search  companies that are not specifically targeting
employees of Weyerhaeuser, any  Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary, Newco or any Newco
Subsidiary shall not result in  a  violation of this Section 6.14.

 

 

SECTION  6.15. _Stock  Exchange Listing._   Weyerhaeuser, Spinco and
Domtar shall use their reasonable best efforts to  cause  the shares of
Spinco Common Stock to be issued in the Transactions pursuant  to  (i) the

requirements  of  the TSX.

 

 

SECTION  6.16. _Tax  Treatment._   The  parties hereto will cooperate with
each other and use their respective  reasonable efforts to cause (i) the
Contribution and the Distribution to qualify  as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(D)  of the Code and as tax-free under
Section 355,  and  (ii) the Arrangement to be tax deferred under the ITA for
certain eligible  holders of Class B Common Shares resident in Canada that
exchange such shares  for Exchangeable Shares, provided appropriate elections
are filed in the  prescribed manner in accordance with Section 85 of the ITA
(the qualifications  referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), the " _Intended 
Tax Treatment_ "),  including not taking any action that such party knows is
reasonably likely  to  prevent the Intended Tax Treatment.

 

 

SECTION  6.17. _Distribution._   (a)  Weyerhaeuser shall use reasonable
efforts to ensure that any decision to effect  the Distribution, in whole or
in part, as an exchange offer will be made  sufficiently in advance of
receipt of any Governmental Approvals such that  the  implementation would
not reasonably be expected to delay the Closing Date by  more than 30 days.

 

 

(b)  If  Weyerhaeuser elects to effect the Distribution, in whole or in
part, as an  exchange offer, Weyerhaeuser shall use reasonable efforts to
and, upon request  by Weyerhaeuser, Domtar shall use reasonable efforts to
consummate the  Distribution within 30 days after satisfaction (or waiver to
the extent  permissible) of all the conditions precedent to the Closing
(other than  conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the time
of the  Transactions and shall in fact be satisfied at such time(s)).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

67  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)  Weyerhaeuser  shall not use an exchange offer to effect the
Distribution, in whole or in  part,  if such exchange offer would result in
occurrence of the Distribution Date  30  days beyond the date on which the
Transactions would otherwise be consummated. 

 

 

(d)  Weyerhaeuser  shall be entitled to delay the Distribution and Closing
for up to 10 Business  Days to comply with any NYSE and TSX rules relating to
notices of record dates  and dividends.

 

 

SECTION  6.18. _Contribution  and Distribution Agreement._   (a) 
Weyerhaeuser, Spinco and Newco shall not terminate or assign the
Contribution  and Distribution Agreement, amend any provision of the
Contribution and  Distribution Agreement, or waive compliance with any of the
agreements or  conditions contained therein without the prior written consent
of  Domtar.

 

 

(b)  In  connection with the assignment, transfer and conveyance of the
Newco Assets  and  the assumption of the Newco Liabilities by Newco, and the
purchase of the Newco  Canada Exchangeco Assets and the assumption of the
Newco Canada Exchangeco  Liabilities by Newco Canada Exchangeco, in each case
as contemplated in the  Contribution and Distribution Agreement, Weyerhaeuser
(i) will keep Domtar  reasonably informed of its progress in obtaining any
necessary or advisable  Consents and Governmental Approvals, and (ii) will
not enter into any agreement  or other instrument with respect to any such
assignment, transfer, conveyance,  assumption or purchase without the prior
approval of Domtar, which consent  shall  not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

 

 

SECTION  6.19. _Covenants  Regarding Non-Solicitation._   (a)  Subject to
Section 6.20, Domtar shall not, directly or indirectly, through  any officer,
director, employee, representative or agent of Domtar or any of  its 
subsidiaries, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by  way
of furnishing information or entering into any form of agreement, 
arrangement or understanding) the initiation of any inquiries or proposals 
regarding an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or 
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw or modify  in
a manner adverse to Weyerhaeuser the approval of the Board of Directors  of 
Domtar of the Transactions or the recommendation of the Board of Directors 
of  Domtar to the holders of Domtar Capital Shares, (iv) approve or
recommend  any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any agreement,
arrangement or  understanding related to any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the preceding  part of this Section 6.19(a **)**   and any 
other provision of this Agreement, nothing shall prevent the Board of
Directors  of Domtar prior to the issuance of the Final Order from
considering,  participating in any discussions or negotiations, or entering
into a  confidentiality agreement and providing information pursuant to 
Section 6.19(c), regarding an unsolicited _bona  fide_ written  Acquisition
Proposal that did not otherwise result from a breach of this  Section 6.19
and that the Board of Directors of Domtar determines in good  faith, after
consultation with financial advisors and outside counsel,  constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal;  _provided,_ _however_
,  that  prior to taking such action, the Board of Directors must have
determined, after  consultation with outside counsel, that it is appropriate
for the Board of  Directors of Domtar take such action in order to discharge
properly its  fiduciary duties. Domtar shall not consider, negotiate, accept,
approve or  recommend an Acquisition Proposal after the date of the issuance
of the Final  Order. Domtar shall, and shall cause the officers, directors,
employees,  representatives and agents of Domtar and its subsidiaries to,
cease immediately  all discussions and negotiations conducted prior to the
date of this Agreement  regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead  to, an Acquisition Proposal. Nothing
contained in this Section 6.19(a) shall  prohibit Domtar from responding to
any unsolicited proposal or inquiry solely  by  advising the person making
such proposal or inquiry of the terms of this Section  6.19(a).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)  Domtar  shall promptly notify Weyerhaeuser, at first orally and then
in writing, of  any  Acquisition Proposal and any inquiry that could lead to
an Acquisition Proposal,  or any amendments to the foregoing, or any request
for non-public information  relating to Domtar or any material Domtar
Subsidiary in connection with an  Acquisition Proposal or for access to the
properties, books or records of Domtar  or any material Domtar Subsidiary by
any person that informs Domtar or such  material Domtar Subsidiary that it is
considering making, or has made, an  Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall
include a description of the material  terms and conditions of any proposal,
the identity of the person making such  proposal, inquiry or contact and
provide such other details of the proposal,  inquiry or contact as
Weyerhaeuser may reasonably request. Domtar shall  (i) keep Weyerhaeuser
fully informed of the status including any change to  the material terms of
any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and  (ii) provide to Weyerhaeuser,
as soon as practicable after receipt or  delivery thereof, copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent  or provided to Domtar or any
Domtar Subsidiary from any person in connection  with any Acquisition
Proposal or sent or provided by Domtar to any person in  connection with any
Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

(c)  If  Domtar  receives a request for material non-public information
from a person who has  made an unsolicited _bona  fide_   written 
Acquisition Proposal and Domtar is permitted, as contemplated under the
second  sentence of Section 6.19(a), to negotiate the terms of such
Acquisition  Proposal, then, and only in such case, the Board of Directors of
Domtar may,  subject to the execution by such person of a confidentiality
agreement  containing a standstill provision substantially similar to that
contained in  the  Confidentiality Agreement, provide such person with
access to information  regarding Domtar; _provided,_ _however_ ,  that  the
person making the Acquisition Proposal shall not be precluded under such 
confidentiality agreement from making the Acquisition Proposal (including
any  amendment thereto); _provided further_  that  Domtar sends a copy of
any such confidentiality agreement to Weyerhaeuser  promptly upon its
execution and Weyerhaeuser is provided with a list of or  copies of the
information provided to such person and immediately provided  with  access
to similar information to which such person was provided.

 

 

(d)  Domtar  shall ensure that its officers, directors and employees and
its subsidiaries  and  their officers, directors and employees and any
financial advisors or other  advisors or representatives retained by it are
aware of the provisions of this  Section 6.19, and it shall be responsible
for any breach of this  Section 6.19 by its officers, directors, employees,
financial advisors or  other advisors or representatives.

 

 

(e)  Notwithstanding  Section 6.19(a)(iii), the Board of Directors of
Domtar may withdraw or  modify in a manner adverse to Weyerhaeuser the
approval of the Board of  Directors of Domtar of the transactions
contemplated hereby if an event has  occurred and is continuing that, either
alone or together with other events,  has  had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Newco Material Adverse  Effect.

SECTION  6.20. _Notice  by Domtar of Superior Proposal Determination._

 

 

(a)  Notwithstanding  Sections 6.19(a), 6.19(b), 6.19(d) and 6.19(e),
Domtar may accept, approve,  recommend or enter into any agreement,
understanding or arrangement in respect  of a Superior Proposal if, and only
if, (i) it has provided Weyerhaeuser  with a copy of the Superior Proposal
document, (ii) five Business Days  shall have elapsed from the later of the
date Weyerhaeuser received written  notice advising Weyerhaeuser that
Domtar's Board of Directors has resolved,  subject only to compliance with
this Section 6.20 and termination of this  Agreement, to accept, approve,
recommend or enter into an agreement in respect  of such Superior Proposal,
specifying the terms and conditions of such Superior  Proposal and
identifying the person making such Superior Proposal, and the  date 
Weyerhaeuser received a copy of such Superior Proposal, and (iii) it has 
previously or concurrently will have (A) paid to Weyerhaeuser the Break Fee 
(as defined in Section 6.21(a)(iii)), if any, payable under Section 6.21  and
(B) terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii). Any 
information provided by Domtar to Weyerhaeuser pursuant to this  Section 6.20
or pursuant to Section 6.19 shall be subject to  Section 6.06.

 

 

(b)  During  such five Business Day period, Domtar agrees that Weyerhaeuser
shall have the  right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of
this Agreement.  The Board of Directors of Domtar will review any offer by
Weyerhaeuser to amend  the terms of this Agreement in good faith in order to
determine, in its  discretion in the exercise of its fiduciary duties,
whether Weyerhaeuser's offer  upon acceptance by Domtar would result in such
Superior Proposal ceasing to  be a  Superior Proposal. If the Board of
Directors of Domtar so determines, it will  enter into an amended agreement
with Weyerhaeuser reflecting Weyerhaeuser's  amended proposal. If the Board
of Directors of Domtar continues to believe,  in  good faith and after
consultation with financial advisors and outside counsel,  that such Superior
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and therefore rejects  Weyerhaeuser's
amended proposal, Domtar may terminate this Agreement pursuant to  Section
8.01(d)(ii); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Domtar must concurrently pay
to Weyerhaeuser the Break Fee, if any, payable  to  Weyerhaeuser under
Section 6.21 **** and  must  concurrently with such termination enter into a
definitive agreement with  respect to such Acquisition Proposal. Domtar
acknowledges and agrees that  payment of the Break Fee, if any, payable under
Section 6.21 is a condition  to valid termination of this Agreement under
Section 8.01(d)(ii) and this  Section 6.20 **.**

 

 

(c)  Domtar  also acknowledges and agrees that each successive modification
of any  Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes  of  the requirement under clause (ii) of Section 6.20(a) to
initiate an  additional five Business Day notice period.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

70  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  6.21. _Break  Fee._

 

 

(a)  If:

 

 

(i) Domtar  shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii),
unless at  the time of such termination, an event has occurred and is
continuing that  has a  Newco Material Adverse Effect;

 

 

(ii) Weyerhaeuser  shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(c)(ii), unless at  the time of such failure to recommend, withdrawal or
adverse modification or  change, or recommendation of an Acquisition
Proposal, an event has occurred  and  is continuing that has a Newco
Material Adverse Effect; or

 

 

(iii) either  Domtar or Weyerhaeuser shall terminate this Agreement pursuant
to  Section 8.01(b)(i) or 8.01(b)(ii) in circumstances where Domtar
Shareholder  Approval has not been obtained at the Domtar Meeting, and (x)(A)
in the case  of  a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i), a  _bona  fide_   Acquisition Proposal has been made by any
person other than a Weyerhaeuser  Party  prior to the Domtar Meeting and not
withdrawn more than five days prior to  the  vote of the Domtar
Shareholders, or (B) in the case of a termination of  this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.01(b)(ii), a _bona  fide_   Acquisition Proposal has been made
by any Person other than a Weyerhaeuser  Party  that is either publicly
disclosed or otherwise becomes publicly known prior  to  or at the time of
the Domtar Meeting and that is not withdrawn more than five  days prior to
the vote of the Domtar Shareholders, and (y) Domtar enters  into an agreement
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or any Acquisition  Proposal is
consummated, after the date hereof and prior to the expiration  of  12
months following termination of this Agreement, unless at the time of  the
Domtar Meeting an event has occurred and is continuing that has a Newco 
Material Adverse Effect;

 

 

then  in  any such case Domtar shall pay to Weyerhaeuser $62,000,000 (the "
_Break  Fee_ ")  in  immediately available funds to an account designated
by Weyerhaeuser. Such  payment shall be due (A) in the case of a termination
specified in clause  (i), prior to the termination of this Agreement, (B) in
the case of a  termination specified in clause (ii), within five Business
Days after written  notice of termination by Weyerhaeuser, or (C) in the case
of a termination  specified in clause (iii), at or prior to the earlier of
the entering into  of  the agreement and the consummation of the transaction
referred to therein;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that in  the event that
Domtar has reimbursed Weyerhaeuser for its out-of-pocket expenses  pursuant
to Section 6.21(b) prior to the date on which the Break Fee is payable,  then
the amount of the Break Fee payable shall be reduced by the amount of 
expenses actually reimbursed by Domtar pursuant to Section 6.21(b). Domtar 
shall  not be obligated to make more than one payment pursuant to this 
Section 6.21(a).

 

 

(b)  Domtar  shall reimburse Weyerhaeuser for all its out-of-pocket
expenses actually  incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions, subject to  a  maximum of $10,000,000, if this Agreement is
terminated in the circumstances  specified in clause (iii) of Section 6.21(a)
and the Break Fee is not  payable upon the date of such termination. Such
reimbursement shall be paid  on  demand following such termination.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

71  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  6.22. _Effect  of Break Fee Payment._   For  greater certainty,
the parties hereto agree that if Domtar pays to Weyerhaeuser  amounts
required by Section 6.21 as a result of the occurrence of any of the  events
referenced in Section 6.21, the Weyerhaeuser Parties shall have no  other
remedy for monetary damages for any breach of this Agreement by  Domtar.

 

 

SECTION  6.23. _Securities  Act Exemptions_ _._   In the  event that, due
to an amendment to the Securities Act, a change in the SEC's  interpretation
of the Securities Act or a decision of a court which provides  that orders of
Canadian courts such as the Final Order do not qualify under  Section
3(a)(10) of the Securities Act, the exemption from registration under 
Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act is not available for any reason to
exempt  the issuance of the Spinco Shares and Exchangeable Shares in
accordance with  the  Arrangement from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, then  Spinco shall take all necessary action to file a
registration statement on  Form  S-4 (or on such other form that may be
available to Spinco) in order to register  the shares of Spinco Common Stock
and Exchangeable Shares, and shall use its  reasonable best efforts to cause
such registration statement to become effective  at or prior to the Effective
Time. In the event that, prior to the Distribution  Date, due to an amendment
to the Securities Act, a change in the SEC's  interpretation of the
Securities Act or a decision of a court, the Distribution  by means of a
dividend is required to be registered under the Securities Act,  then
Weyerhaeuser shall cause Spinco to take all necessary action to file a 
registration statement on Form S-1 (or such other form that may be  available
to Spinco) in order to register the shares of Spinco Common Stock  to  be
distributed as a dividend and shall cause Spinco to use its reasonable best 
efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective at or prior 
to  the Distribution Date.

 

 

SECTION  6.24. _Audited  Financial Statements_ _._   (a) As  soon as
practicable after the date hereof, but no later than November 15,  2006,
Weyerhaeuser shall deliver to Domtar (i) audited balance sheets with  respect
to the Newco Business as of December 25, 2005 and December 26,  2004
(together with the notes thereto, the " _Audited  Newco Balance Sheets_ "), 
and  the related audited statements of results of operations and cash flows
for  each  of the three years in the three-year period ended December 25,
2005 (together  with the notes thereto and the Audited Newco Balance Sheets,
the " _Audited  Newco Financial Statements_ "),  which  shall be
substantially the same as the 2005 Unaudited Newco Financial Statements  with
respect to the period covered by such unaudited financial statements  (except
that the 2005 Unaudited Newco Financial Statements do not reflect the 
Canadian Logging, Forest Management and Saw Mill Operations, which shall be 
reflected in the Audited Newco Financial Statements), with audit adjustments 
that are only immaterial in amount and nature (except with respect to the 
Canadian Logging, Forest Management and Saw Mill Operations), (ii) an 
unqualified audit report on the Audited Newco Financial Statements, and 
(iii) a schedule showing all adjustments to the 2005 Unaudited Newco 
Financial Statements to reflect the Canadian Logging, Forest Management and 
Saw  Mills Operations.

 

 

(b)  The  parties hereto will cooperate with each other and use their
respective  reasonable best efforts to prepare on a timely basis pro forma
financial  statements of Spinco, as adjusted to reflect the consummation of
the  Transactions, prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X promulgated by
the  SEC  and applicable Canadian requirements, for the periods required to
be included  in  the Domtar Circular, the Form 10, the Spinco Registration
Statement or, if  such  filings are required by applicable Law or the SEC,
the Form S-4 or the Exchange  Offer Schedule.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

72  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  6.25. _Domtar  Share Purchase Plans and Domtar Stock Plans._  
(a) As  soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board
of Directors  of Domtar shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be  required to provide that with respect to the Domtar Share
Purchase Plan for  Canadian Employees and the Domtar Share Purchase Plan for
Employees in the  United States (collectively, the " _Domtar  ESPPs_ ") 
(A) each participant's outstanding right to purchase Domtar Common Shares 
under the Domtar ESPPs shall terminate on the last trading day immediately 
prior  to the Measurement Date, (B) any amounts allocated to a
participant's  account under the Domtar ESPPs may be used to purchase Domtar
Common Shares  from  Domtar prior to, but not after, the close of business
on the day prior to the  Measurement Date, and any unused amounts shall be
refunded to such participant,  (C) the Domtar ESPPs shall terminate at the
close of business on the day  immediately prior to the Measurement Date, (D)
with respect to the Domtar  ESPP for Canadian employees, the annual employer
contribution for the calendar  year ended December 31, 2006 shall be made to
participants' accounts on the  day immediately prior to the Measurement Date
(if not previously made), and  (E) no further rights shall be outstanding
under the Domtar ESPPs (other  than Domtar Rights relating to Domtar Common
Shares previously purchased under  the Domtar ESPPs). After the Effective
Time, the Board of Directors of Spinco  may decide, at its discretion,
whether it shall institute replacement share  purchase plans for Spinco
employees.

 

 

SECTION  6.26. _Furnishing  of Tax Opinion._   At least  10 days prior to
the Distribution Date, Weyerhaeuser shall furnish to Domtar  a  copy of the
proposed form of the tax opinion described in Section 7.02(e)  together with
all letters or certificates that form the basis therefor  (collectively, the
" _Opinion  Materials_ ").  Domtar  shall be entitled to provide
Weyerhaeuser with written comments on such Opinion  Materials. Weyerhaeuser
shall consider such comments and shall make changes  to  the Opinion
Materials in accordance with such comments, but only to the extent  that
Weyerhaeuser, acting in good faith, determines that such changes are 
reasonable. Weyerhaeuser shall furnish Spinco with a copy of the final
Opinion  Materials. The Opinion Materials shall not include any letter,
certificate  or  other item to which any Spinco Party is a signatory other
than Section 6.26  of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter.

 

 

SECTION  6.27. _IRS  Ruling._   (a)  Weyerhaeuser and Spinco shall use
their reasonable best efforts to seek, as  promptly as practicable, a private
letter ruling from the IRS, in form and  substance reasonably satisfactory to
Weyerhaeuser (the " _IRS  Ruling_ ")  to the  effect that the Contribution
and the Distribution shall qualify as a tax-free  transaction under Sections
355 and 368 of the Code. Weyerhaeuser shall use  its  reasonable best
efforts to notify Domtar's tax counsel about any substantive  telephone
communications with the IRS regarding any material issues arising  with 
respect to the IRS Ruling, so that such counsel may participate on such
calls;  _provided_ ,  _however,_   that if  advance notification to such
counsel of a call with the IRS is not practically  feasible due to the
initiation of an unscheduled call by the IRS, Weyerhaeuser  shall first
attempt to include Domtar's tax counsel on such call and, if  unsuccessful,
shall timely inform Domtar's tax counsel of any material issues  discussed
with the IRS subsequent to the call. Domtar's tax counsel shall be  allowed
to participate in any in-person conference with the IRS (and  Weyerhaeuser
agrees to take such actions as the IRS may reasonably request  in  order to
permit such participation), unless the IRS objects to such  participation or
such participation will unreasonably delay the holding of  the  conference.
If Domtar's tax counsel participates in any in-person conference  with the
IRS, such participation shall be for the limited purposes of providing 
additional facts and improving the clarity of the discussion relating to 
Domtar\'s role in the Transactions.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

73  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)  The  IRS  Ruling may be based upon customary factual statements,
representations and  covenants by the parties, their subsidiaries and their
shareholders, consistent  with the existing published guidance of the IRS, in
each case with appropriate  modifications to reflect the particular facts of
the Transactions (collectively,  the " _Representations_ ").  Subject to,
and consistent with, Section 6.06, Domtar agrees to provide such  appropriate
information and Representations as the IRS shall reasonably request  in
connection with the IRS Ruling. In the event that the IRS will not issue 
the  ruling requested by Weyerhaeuser, then Weyerhaeuser and Domtar shall
consider  in  good faith any reasonable modifications to the structure of
the Transactions  that will facilitate receipt of the IRS Ruling, so long as
such modifications  will not materially adversely affect the value of the
Transactions to either  party or its shareholders.

 

 

(c)  Weyerhaeuser  shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of
the request for the  IRS  Ruling and supplements thereto to be submitted to
the IRS in connection with  the  IRS Ruling (the " _IRS  Submission_ "). 
Prior  to submitting any IRS Submission, Weyerhaeuser shall provide Domtar's
tax  counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on a draft
of such  IRS Submission; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  Weyerhaeuser may redact
from such draft of such IRS Submission any information  that (x)
Weyerhaeuser, in its good faith judgment, considers to be confidential 
information not germane to the IRS Ruling and to which Domtar is not
otherwise  entitled to have access to pursuant to Section 6.06 and (y) is not
(and is  not  reasonably expected to become) a part of any other publicly
available  information.  Weyerhaeuser shall timely provide to Domtar's tax
counsel a final copy of any  IRS Submission.

 

 

(d)  Weyerhaeuser  shall timely provide Domtar and its tax counsel with a
copy of the IRS Ruling  after receipt thereof from the IRS.

 

 

SECTION  6.28. _Equity  Calculation._   On the  Measurement Date,
Weyerhaeuser shall provide Domtar with all relevant  information regarding
elections by Rollover Employees to receive Substituted  Spinco Options,
Substituted Spinco SARs, Substituted Spinco RSUs and the number  of shares of
Spinco Common Stock issuable pursuant thereto, and Domtar shall  provide
Weyerhaeuser with a statement setting forth the total number of Domtar 
Common Shares then issued and outstanding and all relevant information with 
respect to (i) the Domtar Restricted Shares and the number of additional
Domtar  Common Shares issuable pursuant thereto, and (ii) the Domtar Options,
Domtar  Rights, Domtar DSUs, Domtar PSUs and the number of Domtar Common
Shares to  be  granted pursuant thereto, in each case for the purpose of
determining the number  of shares of Spinco Common Stock to be issued to
Weyerhaeuser on the  Contribution Date in accordance with Section 2.12(b) of
the Contribution  and Distribution Agreement. On the basis of this
information, Weyerhaeuser  and  Domtar shall calculate in good faith the
number of shares of Spinco Common  Stock  to be issued to Weyerhaeuser
pursuant to such Section 2.12. Weyerhaeuser  shall determine the Measurement
Date in accordance with Section 2.12(b) of  the  Contribution and
Distribution Agreement and shall provide Domtar with three  Business Days'
prior notice of such date.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

74  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  6.29. _Redemption  of Excluded IRB Indebtedness._   Prior to 
the Closing Date, Weyerhaeuser shall redeem all Excluded IRB Indebtedness so 
that (i) all Weyerhaeuser's obligations in respect of such indebtedness 
shall have been satisfied in full, and (ii) all Liens on Newco Assets 
securing such Excluded IRB Indebtedness shall have been irrevocably released 
and  terminated.

 

 

SECTION  6.30. _Confidentiality._   (a)  Domtar and its affiliates
acknowledge that the information being provided to  them in connection with
the Transactions is subject to the terms of the  Confidentiality Agreement,
which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective  upon, and only upon,
the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate  with respect to
information relating solely to the Newco Business; _provided_ ,  _however,_
  that  Domtar acknowledges that any and all other information provided to
it by  Weyerhaeuser, any of its affiliates or their respective
representatives  concerning Weyerhaeuser or any of its affiliates shall
remain subject to the  terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement
after the  Closing.

 

 

(b)  Weyerhaeuser  shall keep confidential, and cause its affiliates and
instruct its and their  officers, directors, employees and advisors to keep
confidential, all  information relating to the Newco Business except as
required by law or  administrative process and except for information which
is available to the  public on the Closing Date, or thereafter becomes
available to the public other  than as a result of a breach of this Section
6.30(b). The covenants set forth  in  this Section 6.30 shall terminate two
years after the Closing Date.

 

 

SECTION  6.31. _Internal  Controls._   The  parties hereto will cooperate
with each other and use their respective  reasonable best efforts to (A)
design a system of internal controls over  financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange  Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability  of  financial reporting by
Spinco after the Effective Time, and the preparation  of  financial
statements of Spinco after the Effective Time for external purposes,  and (B)
design disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules  13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information  that
Spinco will be required to disclose after the Effective Time in the reports 
it is required to file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed,  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC's rules and  forms and is accumulated and communicated to Spinco's
management as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required

time prior to the Effective  Time:

 

 

(a) by  mutual  written consent of each party hereto;

 

 

(b) by  either  Weyerhaeuser or Domtar:

 

 

(i)  if  the  Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before the date
that is 364 days  after the date of this Agreement (the " _Outside  Date_
"),  unless the failure to consummate the Transactions is the result of a
material  breach of any Transaction Document by the party seeking to
terminate this  Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the passage of
such period shall be tolled for any part thereof during which  any  party
shall be subject to a non-final order, decree, ruling or action  restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the  Transactions;

 

 

(ii)  if  Domtar  Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained by
reason of the failure  to  obtain the required vote at the Domtar Meeting;

 

 

(iii)  if  there  shall be passed any Law that makes consummation of the

or decree enjoining  Weyerhaeuser or Domtar from consummating the

final and non-appealable;  or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

79  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iv)  if  any  condition to the obligation of such party to consummate the
Transactions set  forth in Section 7.02 (in the case of Weyerhaeuser) or 7.03
(in the case of  Domtar) becomes incapable of satisfaction prior to the
Outside Date, unless  the  failure of such condition is the result of a
breach of any Transaction Document  by the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement;

 

 

(c) by  Weyerhaeuser;

 

 

(i)  if  Domtar  breaches or fails to perform in any respect any of its
representations,  warranties or covenants contained in any Transaction
Document, which breach  or  failure to perform (i) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set  forth in Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b), and (ii)
cannot be or has not  been cured within 30 days after the giving of written
notice to Domtar of such  breach (provided that Weyerhaeuser or Newco is not
then in material breach  of  any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in any Transaction Document);  or

 

 

(ii)  if  the  Board of Directors of Domtar shall have failed to
recommend, withdrawn, modified  or changed in a manner adverse to
Weyerhaeuser its approval or recommendation  of  this Agreement or the
Arrangement or shall have recommended an Acquisition  Proposal; or

 

 

(d) by  Domtar:

 

 

(i)  if  any of  Weyerhaeuser or the Spinco Parties breaches or fails to
perform in any respect  of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in any  Transaction Document, which breach or failure to
perform (i) would give  rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.03(a) or 7.03(b),  and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within
30 days after the giving of  written notice to Weyerhaeuser of such breach
(provided that Domtar is not  then  in material breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant in any  Transaction Document); or

 

 

(ii)  in  order  to enter into a definitive written agreement with respect
to a Superior  Proposal, subject to compliance with Section 6.20 and the
payment of any fee  required to be paid pursuant to Section 6.21(a).

 

 

SECTION  8.02. _Effect  of Termination._   In the  event of termination of
this Agreement by either Weyerhaeuser or Domtar as  provided in Section 8.01,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and  have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Weyerhaeuser,  the Spinco Parties and
Domtar, other than Section 3.15, Section 4.15,  the last sentence of Section
6.06, Section 6.11, Section 6.21,  Section 6.22, this Section 8.02 and
Article IX, which provisions shall  survive such termination, provided,
however, that, subject to Section 6.22,  a termination of this Agreement
shall not relieve any party hereto from any  liability or damages resulting
from the willful and material breach by such  party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set  forth in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

80  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  8.03. _Amendment._   This  Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  after the
Distribution, there shall be made no amendment that by law requires  further

approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by 
an  instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties  hereto.

 

 

SECTION  8.04. _Extension;  Waiver._   At any  time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto may (a) extend the  time for the

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties  contained
in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this  Agreement,
or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions  contained
in this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  such extension or
waiver by Domtar or Spinco shall require the approval of  their  respective
stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such  extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing  signed
on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement  to 
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute  a waiver of such rights.

 

 

SECTION  8.05. _Procedure  for Termination, Amendment, Extension or
Waiver._ A  termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an
amendment of  this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or
waiver pursuant  to Section 8.04 shall, in order to be effective, require in

limitations or  restrictions thereof, of the shares of such series. The
powers, preferences  and  relative, participating, optional and other
special rights of each series  of  Preferred Stock, and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof,  if  any, may differ from those of any
and all other series at any time  outstanding.

vote on  each  matter on which holders of the Common Stock or stockholders
generally are  entitled to vote, and the holder of the share of Special
Voting Stock shall  be  entitled to cast on each such matter a number of
votes equal to the number  of  shares of Common Stock into which the
exchangeable shares of [Newco Canada  Exchangeco] (the " _Exchangeable 
Shares_ ")  outstanding on the record date for holders of Common Stock
entitled to vote  on  any such matter are then exchangeable (A) that are not
owned by the Corporation  or its affiliates and (B) as to which the holder of
the share of Special  Voting  Stock has timely received, as determined
pursuant to the Voting and Exchange  Trust Agreement to be entered into among
[Newco Canada Exchangeco, [ ], the  Corporation and [ ], as trustee (as it
may be amended from time to time,  the " _Voting  Agreement_ "),  voting
instructions from the holders of such Exchangeable Shares in accordance  with
the Voting Agreement.

 

 

(ii)  Except  as  otherwise provided herein or by applicable law, the
holder of the share of  Special Voting Stock and the holders of shares of

Voting Stock shall be entitled  to receive out of the assets of the
Corporation available for distribution  to  the stockholders, an amount
equal to $0.01 before any distribution is made  on  the Common Stock of the
Corporation or any other stock ranking junior to  the  Special Voting Stock
as to distribution of assets upon voluntary or involuntary  liquidation.
After payment of the full amount of the liquidation preference  of  the
share of Special Voting Stock, the holder of the share of Special Voting 
Stock shall not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution 
of  assets of the Corporation.

 

 

(ii)  For  the  purposes of this Section 2.03(d), neither the sale,
conveyance, exchange  or  transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or
other consideration) of  all  or substantially all of the property or assets
of the Corporation nor the  consolidation or merger of the Corporation with
or into one or more other  entities shall be deemed to be a voluntary or
involuntary  liquidation.

 

 

(e) _No  Redemption; No Sinking Fund_.

 

 

(i)  The  share  of Special Voting Stock shall not be subject to
redemption by the Corporation  or  at the option of its holder, except that

shall be subject to the express terms of the Preferred Stock  and  any
series thereof.

 

 

(b)  _Voting  Rights_.  Each  holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to
one vote for each share of Common  Stock held of record by such holder on all
matters on which stockholders  generally are entitled to vote; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that,  except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common
Stock shall not be  entitled to vote on any amendment to this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation  (including any certificate filed pursuant to
the DGCL (" _Certificate  of Designation_ ")  relating to any series of
Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms  of  one or more
outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such  affected series
are entitled, either separately or together with the holders  of  one or
more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Restated 
Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation
relating  to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL. Except
as otherwise  provided by law, by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation

resolutions adopted by  the  Board of Directors designating any series of
Preferred Stock, the Common  Stock  shall have the exclusive right to vote

Stock by the Board of Directors at any time or from time to  time  out of
any funds legally available therefor.

 

 

(d)  _Liquidation  Rights_.  In the  event of any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding  up of  the Corporation, and
subject to the rights of any class or series of stock  having a preference
over the Common Stock as to the distribution of assets  upon  liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of  shares  of
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive all of the remaining assets  of
the  Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, ratably in

applicable  to the  Corporation, in all matters other than the election of

Except as otherwise required  by  law and subject to the rights of the
holders of any series of Preferred Stock  or  any class or series of stock
having a preference over the Common Stock as  to  dividends or upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, special meetings  of  stockholders
of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes may be called  only  by the
Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution stating the purpose or  purposes
thereof approved by a majority of the total number of Directors  which  the
Corporation would have if there were no vacancies (the " _Whole  Board_ ")

holders of any series of Preferred Stock or any class or series  of  stock
having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon 
liquidation, dissolution or winding up to elect Directors under this
Restated  Certificate of Incorporation or any resolution or resolutions
providing for  the  issue of such class or series of stock adopted by the
Board of Directors,  a  plurality of the votes cast at a duly called annual
or special meeting of  stockholders shall be the vote required to elect
Directors.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A-5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  4.02. _Number  and Terms_.  Except  as otherwise fixed by or
pursuant to the provisions of Article II hereof  relating to the rights of
the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or  any  class or series of
stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to  dividends or upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up to elect additional  Directors under
specified circumstances, the number of the Directors shall  be  fixed from
time to time exclusively pursuant to a resolution adopted by a  majority of
the Whole Board (but shall not be less than three). Subject to  Section 4.06,
the Directors shall be classified, with respect to the time  for  which they
severally hold office, into three classes, as nearly equal in  number  as
possible, one class to be originally elected for a term expiring at the 
first  annual meeting of stockholders following the effectiveness of this
Restated  Certificate of Incorporation, another class to be originally
elected for  a term  expiring at the second annual meeting of stockholders
following the  effectiveness of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
and another  class  to be originally elected for a term expiring at the
third annual meeting  of  stockholders following the effectiveness of this
Restated Certificate of  Incorporation, with each Director to hold office
until such person's successor  is duly elected and qualified. At each annual
meeting of stockholders, Directors  elected to succeed those Directors whose
terms then expire shall be elected  for  a term of office to expire at the
third succeeding annual meeting of  stockholders after their election, with
each Director to hold office until  such  person's successor shall have been
duly elected and qualified.

 

 

SECTION  4.03. _Newly  Created Directorships And Vacancies_.  Except  as
otherwise provided for or fixed by or pursuant to the provisions of Article 
II relating to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock  or
any  class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as
to  dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up to elect
Directors  under specified circumstances, newly created directorships
resulting from  any  increase in the number of Directors and any vacancies
on the Board of Directors  resulting from death, resignation,
disqualification, removal or other cause  shall be filled by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the remaining Directors  then in office, even though
less than a quorum of the Board of Directors,  and  not by the stockholders.
Any Director elected in accordance with the preceding  sentence shall hold
office for the remainder of the full term of the class  of  Directors in
which the new directorship was created or the vacancy occurred  and  until
such Director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. No 
decrease in the number of Directors constituting the Board of Directors
shall  shorten the term of any incumbent Director.

 

 

SECTION  4.04. _Removal_.  Subject  to the rights of any class or series
of stock having a preference over the  Common Stock as to dividends or upon
liquidation to elect Directors under  specified circumstances, any director
may be removed from office only for  cause  and only by the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least 75% of the voting  power of all shares of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the  election of Directors (the "
_Voting  Stock_ ")  then  outstanding, voting together as a single class.

 

 

SECTION  4.05. _Preferred  Stock_.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
whenever the holders of any series of Preferred  Stock or any class or series
of stock having a preference over the Common  Stock  as to dividends or upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up shall have  the  right, voting
separately by series, to elect Directors under specified  circumstances, the
election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other  features of such
directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Restated  Certificate of
Incorporation applicable thereto, and such Directors so elected  shall not be
classified pursuant to this Article IV unless expressly provided  by  the
terms of such series of Preferred Stock.

repealed and new By-laws may be adopted (a) by the affirmative  vote of a
majority of the Whole Board, or (b) at any annual or special  meeting of

be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders  for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a Director, except to  the  extent
such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted  by 
the DGCL. Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Section 7.01 shall 
eliminate or reduce the effect of this Section 7.01 in respect of any matter 
occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Section 
7.01, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment or repeal.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A-7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  7.02. _Indemnification  and Insurance_.  (a)  _Right  To
Indemnification_.  Each  person who was or is made a party or is threatened
to be made a party to  or is  involved in any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal,  administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "
_Proceeding_ "),  by  reason of the fact that such person, or a person of
whom such person is the  legal representative, is or was a Director or
officer of the Corporation  or,  while a Director or officer of the
Corporation, is or was serving at the  request  of the Corporation as a
Director, officer, employee or agent of another  corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,  including service
with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis  of  such
Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a Director,  officer,
employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a Director, 
officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the 
Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists 
or  may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss
(including  attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement, and  excise taxes or penalties arising under the Employee
Retirement Income Security  Act of 1974, as in effect from time to time)
reasonably incurred or suffered  by  such person in connection therewith and
such indemnification shall continue  as  to a person who has ceased to be a
Director, officer, employee or agent and  shall inure to the benefit of such
person's heirs, executors and administrators;  _provided_ ,  _however,_  
that,  except as provided in paragraph (b) hereof, the Corporation shall
indemnify  any  such person seeking indemnification in connection with a
Proceeding (or part  thereof) initiated by such person only if such
Proceeding (or part thereof)  was  authorized by the Board of Directors. The
Corporation may pay the expenses  incurred in defending any such Proceeding
in advance of its final disposition;  any advance payments to be paid by the
Corporation within 20 calendar days  after  the receipt by the Corporation
of a statement or statements from the claimant  requesting such advance or
advances from time to time; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that,  to the extent
the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by  a  Director or
officer in such person's capacity as a Director or officer (and not  in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person  while a 
Director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee 
benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding, shall  be
made  only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on
behalf  of such  Director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
shall ultimately  be  determined that such Director or officer is not
entitled to be indemnified  under  this Section 7.02 or otherwise. The
Corporation may, to the extent authorized  from time to time by the Board of
Directors, grant rights to indemnification,  and rights to have the
Corporation pay the expenses incurred in defending  any  Proceeding in
advance of its final disposition, to any employee or agent  of the 
Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VII with 
respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of Directors and 
officers of the Corporation.

(b)  _Right  of Claimant to Bring Suit_.  If a  claim under paragraph (a)
of this Section 7.02 is not paid in full by the  Corporation within 30
calendar days after a written claim has been received  by the Corporation,
the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against  the Corporation
to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful  in  whole or
in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense  of 
prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than 
an  action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending
any  Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required
undertaking,  if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that
the claimant  has  not met the standard of conduct which makes it
permissible under the DGCL  for  the Corporation to indemnify the claimant
for the amount claimed, but the  burden  of proving such defense shall be on
the Corporation. Neither the failure  of the  Corporation (including its
Board of Directors, independent legal counsel,  or its  stockholders) to
have made a determination prior to the commencement of such  action that
indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances  because the
claimant has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth  in the  DGCL,
nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board  of 
Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant 
has  not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
action  or  create a presumption that the claimant has not met the
applicable standard  of  conduct.

 

 

(c)  _Non-Exclusivity  of Rights_.  The  right to indemnification and the
payment of expenses incurred in defending  a  Proceeding in advance of its
final disposition conferred in this Section  7.02  shall not be exclusive of
any other right which any person may have or hereafter  acquire under any
statute, provision of this Restated Certificate of  Incorporation (including
any Certificate of Designation), By-law, agreement,  vote of stockholders or
disinterested Directors or otherwise. No repeal or  modification of this
Article VII shall in any way diminish or adversely affect  the rights of any
Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation  hereunder in respect
of any occurrence or matter arising prior to any such  repeal or
modification.

 

 

(d)  _Insurance_.  The  Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and  any  Director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation,  partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any such expense,  liability or loss, whether or not
the Corporation would have the power to  indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the  DGCL.

 

 

 

(a)  _Severability_.  If any  provision or provisions of this Article VII
shall be held to be invalid,  illegal  or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality  and  enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Article VII (including,  without limitation, each portion
of any paragraph of this Article VII containing  any such provision held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is  not  itself held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way  be  affected or
impaired thereby; and (ii) to the fullest extent possible,  the  provisions
of this Article VII (including, without limitation, each such  portion  of
any paragraph of this Article VII containing any such provision held  to be 
invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect 
to  the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or 
unenforceable.

(ii) For  nominations or other business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting  by  a stockholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i)
of this  Section 2.07, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof
in  writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and such other business
must  otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a 
stockholder\'s notice shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation 
at  the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the
close  of  business on the 90th calendar day nor earlier than the close of
business  on the  120th calendar day prior to the first anniversary of the
preceding year\'s  annual  meeting; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that in 
the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 calendar days 
before or more than 60 calendar days after such anniversary date, notice  by
the  stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the
close  of  business on the 120th calendar day prior to such annual meeting
and not later  than the close of business on the 90th calendar day prior to
such annual  meeting; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,  _however_ ,  that in 
the event that less than 100 calendar days' notice or prior public disclosure
by  the Corporation of the date of the meeting is given or made to
stockholders,  notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not
later than  the  close of business on the 10th calendar day following the
calendar day on  which  such notice of the date of the annual meeting was
mailed or such public  announcement was made by the Corporation, whichever
first occurs. For purposes  of determining whether a stockholder\'s notice
shall have been delivered in  a  timely manner for the annual meeting of
stockholders in 2007, the first  anniversary of the previous year\'s meeting
shall be deemed to be [ ], 2007.  In  no event shall the public announcement
by the Corporation of an adjournment  or  postponement of an annual meeting
commence a new time period for the giving  of a  stockholder\'s notice as
described above. Such stockholder\'s notice shall  set  forth (A) as to each
person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for  election or reelection
as a Director all information relating to such person  that is required to be
disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election  of  Directors in an
election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case  pursuant to
Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as  amended  (the
" _Exchange  Act_ "),  and  Rule 14a-11 (or any successor thereof) under
the Exchange Act (including  such  person\'s written consent to being named
in the proxy statement as a nominee  and  to serving as a Director if
elected); (B) as to any other business that the  stockholder proposes to
bring before the meeting, a brief description of  the  business desired to
be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal  or  business
(including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration  and  in
the event that such business includes a proposal to amend these By-Laws, 
the  language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such
business  at  the meeting and any material interest in such business of such
stockholder  and  the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal
is made; and (C)  as  to the stockholder giving the notice and the
beneficial owner, if any, on  whose  behalf the nomination or proposal is
made (1) the name and address of such  stockholder, as they appear on the
Corporation\'s books, and of such beneficial  owner, (2) the class and number
of shares of the Corporation which are owned  beneficially and of record by
such stockholder and such beneficial owner,  (3) a representation that the
stockholder is a holder of record of stock of  the Corporation entitled to
vote at such meeting and intends to appear in  person  or by proxy at the
meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4)  a  representation
whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends  or is part
of a group which intends (x) to deliver a proxy statement and/or  form  of
proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation\'s
outstanding  capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect
the nominee  and/or (y) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in
support of such  proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements
shall be deemed  satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified
the Corporation  of  his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual
meeting in compliance  with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) under the
Exchange Act and such  stockholder\'s proposal has been included in a proxy
statement that has been  prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for
such annual meeting. The  Corporation may require any proposed nominee to
furnish such other information  as it may reasonably require to determine the
eligibility of such proposed  nominee to serve as a Director.

(iii) Notwithstanding  anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii)
of this Section 2.07  to the  contrary, in the event that the number of
Directors to be elected to the  Board  of Directors is increased and there
is no public announcement by the Corporation  naming all of the nominees for
Director or specifying the size of the increased  Board of Directors at least
100 calendar days prior to the first anniversary  of  the preceding year\'s
annual meeting, a stockholder\'s notice required by  paragraph (a)(ii) of
this Section 2.07 shall also be considered timely, but  only  with respect
to nominees for any new positions created by such increase,  if it  shall be
delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of  the 
Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th calendar day 
following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the 
Corporation.

 

 

(b)  _Special  Meetings of Stockholders_.  Only  such business shall be
conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as  shall  have been brought
before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation\'s notice  of  meeting under
Section 2.04. Nominations of persons for election to the Board  of 
Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which
Directors  are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation\'s notice of meeting
(i) by  or at  the direction of the Board of Directors, or (ii) provided
that the Board  of  Directors has determined that Directors shall be elected
at such meeting,  by any  stockholder of the Corporation who is a
stockholder of record at the time  he or  she gave notice as provided in
paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 2.07, who  shall  be entitled to vote at
the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures  set forth in this
paragraph (b) of Section 2.07. In the event the Corporation  calls a special
meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or  more  Directors
to the Board of Directors, any stockholder may nominate a person  or 
persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified 
in  the Corporation\'s notice of meeting pursuant to such clause (ii), if a
notice  by  such stockholder meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(ii)
of this Section  2.07 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal
executive offices  of  the Corporation not earlier than the close of
business on the 120th calendar  day  prior to such special meeting and not
later than the close of business on  the  90th calendar day prior to such
special meeting; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that in  the event that less
than 100 calendar days' notice or prior public disclosure by  the corporation
of the date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders,  notice by the
stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than  the  close of
business on the 10th calendar day following the calendar day on  which 
notice of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by 
the  Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting was mailed or such
public  announcement was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the
public  announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting
commence  a  new time period for the giving of a stockholder\'s notice as
described  above.

serve as Directors and only such business  shall be conducted at a meeting of
stockholders as shall have been brought  before the meeting in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Section  2.07. Except as otherwise
provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation  or  these By-Laws, the
presiding officer shall have the power and duty to determine  whether a
nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting  was
made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures 
set  forth in this Section 2.07 (including whether the stockholder or
beneficial  owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made
solicited  (or  is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit,
as the case may  be,  proxies in support of such stockholder\'s nominee or
proposal in compliance  with  such stockholder\'s representation as required
by clause (a)(ii)(C)(4) of  this  Section 2.07) and, if any proposed
nomination or business is not in compliance  with this Section 2.07, to
declare that such defective proposal or nomination  shall be disregarded.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section  2.07, if the
stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder)  does  not
appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation 
to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded 
and  such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that
proxies  in  respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.

 

 

(ii) For  purposes of this Section 2.07, "public announcement" shall mean
disclosure in a  press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,

the Exchange Act, or (b) of the holders  of any series of Preferred Stock or
any class or series of stock having a  preference over the Common Stock as to

or resolutions providing for  the  issue of such class or series of stock
adopted by the Board of  Directors.

 

 

SECTION  2.08. _Procedure  for Election of Directors; Required Vote_. 
Election of Directors at all meetings of the stockholders at which Directors 
are  to be elected shall be by ballot, and, subject to the rights of the
holders  of  any series of Preferred Stock or any class or series of stock
having a  preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon
liquidation,  dissolution or winding up to elect Directors under the
Certificate of  Incorporation or any resolution or resolutions providing for
the issue of  such  class or series of stock adopted by the Board of
Directors, a plurality of  the  votes cast thereat shall be the vote
required to elect Directors. Except  as  otherwise provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation (including any  Certificate of Designation (as
defined in the Certificate of Incorporation)),  applicable stock exchange
rules or other rules and regulations applicable  to the  Corporation or
these By-Laws, in all matters other than the election of  Directors, the

inspectors, which inspector or inspectors  may include individuals who serve
the Corporation in other capacities,  including, without limitation, as
officers, employees, agents or  representatives, to act at any meeting of
stockholders and make a written  report  thereof. One or more persons may be
designated as alternate inspector(s)  to  replace any inspector who fails to
act. If no inspector or alternate has  been  appointed to act or is able to
act at a meeting of stockholders, the presiding  officer shall appoint one or
more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each  inspector, before discharging
such person\'s duties, shall take and sign an  oath  faithfully to execute
the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and  according to the best
of such person\'s ability. The inspector(s) shall have  the  duties
prescribed by law.

 

 

(b)  The  date  and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for
each matter upon  which  the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be
announced at the meeting  by the  officer presiding over the meeting. The
Board of Directors may adopt by  resolution such rules and regulations for
the conduct of the meeting of  stockholders as it shall deem appropriate.
Except to the extent inconsistent  with such rules and regulations as adopted
by the Board of Directors, the  presiding officer shall have the right and
authority to convene and to adjourn  the meeting, to prescribe such rules,
regulations and procedures and to do  all  such acts as, in the judgment of
such presiding officer, are appropriate  for the  proper conduct of the
meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether  adopted by the Board
of Directors or prescribed by the presiding officer  of the  meeting, may
include, without limitation, the following: (i) an agenda or  order  of
business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order 
at  the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on
attendance  at  or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of

(v) limitations  on the time allotted to questions or comments by
participants. The presiding  officer at any meeting of stockholders, in
addition to making any other  determinations that may be appropriate to the
conduct of the meeting, shall,  if  the facts warrant, determine and declare
to the meeting that a matter or  business was not properly brought before the
meeting and if such presiding  officer should so determine, such person shall
so declare to the meeting  that  any such matter or business not properly
brought before the meeting shall  not be  transacted or considered. Unless
and to the extent determined by the Board  of  Directors or the person
presiding over the meeting, meetings of stockholders  shall not be required
to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary  procedure.

**ARTICLE 4**

 

 

**CERTIFICATES**

 

 

**4.1** **Issuance  of Exchangeable Share** **s  and Shares of Spinco Common
Stock**

 

 

For  the  purposes of completing the Exchangeable Share Issuance and the
Spinco Share  Issuance in connection with the Arrangement, each of (i) Newco
Canada, and  (ii) Newco Canada Exchangeco, shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent, prior  to the Effective Time, a single certificate representing the
aggregate number  of  shares of Spinco Common Stock deliverable by Newco
Canada and the aggregate  number of Exchangeable Shares deliverable by Newco
Canada Exchangeco in  accordance with section 2.2,  in each  case less any
amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.6,  and  shall instruct the Exchange
Agent to hold in trust, until the Effective Time,  the appropriate number of
such shares to be delivered to each holder of Domtar  Common Shares following
the exchange of the Class B Common Shares. Provided  that each of Newco
Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco has complied with the  immediately
preceding sentence, on and after the Effective Time, the rights  of  each
holder of Domtar Common Shares who has not exercised its Dissent Rights  will
be limited to receiving, as a holder of Class B Common Shares under  section
2.2,  that  number of shares of Spinco Common Stock or Exchangeable Shares,
as the case  may  be, and the Ancillary Rights to which such holder of Class
B Common Shares  is entitled pursuant to section 2.2  (together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant  to  section 4.2)
**** upon  presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates
representing the Domtar  Common Shares held by such holder and the holder
shall after the Effective  Time  be considered and deemed for all purposes
to be the holder of the shares of  Spinco Common Stock or Exchangeable
Shares, as the case may be, to which it  is  entitled pursuant to section
2.2.  At the  Effective Time, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
certificate or  certificates representing the Domtar Common Shares held by
such holder prior  to  the Effective Time, together with such other
documents and instruments as may  be  required to effect a transfer of such
Domtar Common Shares and such additional  documents and instruments as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the  holder of such surrendered
certificate or certificates shall be entitled to  receive as a holder of
Class B Common Shares, and the Exchange Agent on  behalf of Newco Canada or
Newco Canada Exchangeco, shall deliver to such holder,  in the form of a
certificate or in whole or in part, in book-entry form through  the direct
registration system, the shares of Spinco Common Stock or  Exchangeable
Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  section 2.2,  less 
any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.6  hereof.

 

 

**4.2** **Distributions  with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates**

 

 

No  dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time  with  respect to Exchangeable Shares or shares of Spinco Common Stock
with a record  date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered  certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented  outstanding Domtar Common Shares that were exchanged pursuant
to  section 2.2,  and no  interest shall be earned or payable on these
proceeds, unless and until the  holder of such certificate shall surrender
such certificate in accordance with  section 4.1.  Subject  to applicable
law, at the time of such surrender of any such certificate (or,  in  the
case of clause (ii) below, at the appropriate payment date), there  shall be
paid to the holder of the certificates representing Domtar Common  Shares,
without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other  distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid  with  respect to the
Exchangeable Shares or shares of Spinco Common Stock, as the  case  may be,
to which such holder is entitled pursuant hereto and (ii) on the  appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with  a  record
date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date 
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such Exchangeable Shares or 
shares of Spinco Common Stock, as the case may be.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D-13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**4.3** **Lost  Certificates**

 

 

In  the  event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented  one or more outstanding Domtar Common Shares that were exchanged
pursuant to  section 2.2  shall  have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that  fact by the person claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,  the Exchange Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed  certificate, one or more
certificates representing one or more Exchangeable  Shares or shares of
Spinco Common Stock (and any dividends or distributions  with  respect
thereto) deliverable in accordance with such holder's Letter of  Transmittal
and Election Form. When authorizing such payment in exchange for  any  lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, the person to whom certificates 
representing Exchangeable Shares or shares of Spinco Common Stock are to be 
issued shall, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, give a bond 
satisfactory to Newco Canada Exchangeco, Newco Canada and Spinco and their 
respective transfer agents in such sum as Newco Canada Exchangeco, Newco
Canada  or Spinco may direct or otherwise indemnify Newco, Newco Canada and
Spinco  in a  manner satisfactory to Newco Canada Exchangeco, Newco Canada
and Spinco against  any claim that may be made against Newco Canada
Exchangeco, Newco Canada or  Spinco with respect to the certificate alleged
to have been lost, stolen or  destroyed.

 

 

**4.4** **Extinction  of Rights**

 

 

Any  certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented 
outstanding Domtar Common Shares that were exchanged pursuant to  section
2.2  that is  not deposited with all other instruments required by section
4.1  on or  prior to the date of the notice referred to in section 3.7.2 
of the  Exchangeable Share Provisions, shall cease to represent a claim or
interest  of  any kind or nature as a shareholder of Newco Canada Exchangeco
or Spinco. On  such date, the Exchangeable Shares or the shares of Spinco
Common Stock to  which  the former holder of the certificate referred to in
the preceding sentence  was  ultimately entitled shall be deemed to have
been surrendered for no  consideration to Newco Canada Exchangeco or Newco
Canada, as the case may be,  together with all entitlements to dividends,
distributions and interest in  respect thereof held for such former holder.

 

 

**4.5** **No  Liability**

 

 

None  of  the parties to the Transaction Agreement or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable  to any person in respect of any shares of Spinco Common
Stock or any  Exchangeable Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or  proceeds from a sale pursuant to section 4.1  that are 
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property,  escheat or similar law. If any claim for the Arrangement
Consideration (as  defined in the Transaction Agreement) or any dividends has
not been made prior  to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier  date on which the Arrangement Consideration or
dividends in respect of such  shares would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Government  Entity), any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions shall, to the extent  permitted by applicable law, become the
property of Newco Canada or Newco Canada  Exchangeco, as applicable, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any  person previously entitled thereto.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D-14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**4.6** **Withholding  Rights**

 

 

Newco  Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco shall be entitled, and may instruct
the  Exchange Agent or the Transfer Agent, as the case may be, to deduct and
withhold  from any dividend or consideration otherwise payable to any holder
of Domtar  Common Shares, Class B Common Shares, shares of Spinco Common
Stock or  Exchangeable Shares such amounts as Newco Canada or Newco Canada
Exchangeco  is  required or permitted to deduct and withhold with respect to
such payments  under  (i) the ITA, the United States _Internal  Revenue
Code of 1986_ or  any  provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax
law, in each case, as  amended or succeeded or (ii) required or permitted in
order to comply with  Section 116 of the ITA or any corresponding provisions
of provincial law. To  the  extent any amounts are withheld, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes  hereof as having been paid to the persons
otherwise entitled thereto, provided  that such withheld amounts are actually
remitted to the appropriate taxing  authority. To the extent that the amount
so required or permitted to be deducted  or withheld from any payment to a
holder exceeds the cash portion of the  consideration otherwise payable to
the holder, Newco Canada Exchangeco, Newco  Canada and the Exchange Agent are
hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose  of, subject to applicable
law, such portion of the consideration as is necessary  to provide sufficient
funds to Newco Canada Exchangeco, Newco Canada or the  Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction  or withholding
requirement and Newco Canada Exchangeco, Newco Canada or the  Exchange Agent
shall notify the holder thereof and remit any unapplied balance  of the net
proceeds of such sale.

 

 

**ARTICLE 5**

 

 

**CERTAIN  RIGHTS OF NEWCO CANADA TO ACQUIRE**

 

**EXCHANGEABLE  SHARES**

 

 

**5.1** **Newco  Canada Liquidation Call Right**

 

 

       (a)   |  

Newco  Canada shall have the overriding right (the " **Liquidation  Call
Right** "),  in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed liquidation,
dissolution  or winding-up of Newco Canada Exchangeco pursuant to  Article
3.5  of  the Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase from all but not
less  than  all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any
holder  of  Exchangeable Shares which is a subsidiary of Spinco) on the
Liquidation  Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held
by  each  such holder on payment by Newco Canada of an amount per
Exchangeable  Share  (the " **Liquidation  Call Purchase Price** ")  equal
to the Current Market Price of a share of Spinco Common Stock  on the  last
Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which shall be satisfied  in full
by Newco Canada causing to be delivered to such holder one  share  of Spinco
Common Stock, plus any Dividend Amount. In the event of  the  exercise of
the Liquidation Call Right by Newco Canada, each holder  shall  be obligated
to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder  to  Newco Canada on
the Liquidation Date on payment by Newco Canada to  the  holder of the
Liquidation Call Purchase Price for each such share,  and  Newco Canada
Exchangeco shall have no obligation to pay any Liquidation  Amount to the
holders of such shares so purchased by Newco  Canada.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

To  exercise the Liquidation Call Right, Newco Canada must notify Newco 
Canada  Exchangeco's transfer agent (the " **Transfer  Agent** "),  as
agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares, and Newco Canada  Exchangeco of
Newco Canada's intention to exercise such right at least 45  days before the
Liquidation Date in the case of a voluntary liquidation,  dissolution or
winding up of Newco Canada Exchangeco and at least  five  Business Days
before the Liquidation Date in the case of an involuntary  liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of Newco Canada Exchangeco.  The  Transfer Agent
will notify the holders of Exchangeable Shares as  to  whether or not Newco
Canada has exercised the Liquidation Call Right  forthwith after the expiry
of the period during which the same may  be  exercised by Newco Canada. If
Newco Canada exercises the Liquidation  Call  Right, then on the Liquidation
Date Newco Canada will purchase and  the  holders will sell all of the
Exchangeable Shares then outstanding  for a  price per share equal to the
Liquidation Call Purchase  Price.

       (c)   |  

For  the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable Shares 
pursuant to the Liquidation Call Right, Newco Canada shall deposit  with 
the Transfer Agent, on or before the Liquidation Date, one single 
certificate representing the aggregate number of shares of Spinco  Common 
Stock deliverable by Newco Canada and a cheque or cheques of Newco  Canada 
payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Newco Canada representing  the
aggregate Dividend Amount, if any, in payment of the total Liquidation  Call
Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld pursuant to  section 4.6. 
Provided that Newco Canada has complied with the immediately preceding 
sentence, on and after the Liquidation Date the rights of each holder  of 
Exchangeable Shares will be limited to receiving such holder's  proportionate
part of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price payable  by  Newco Canada
upon presentation and surrender by the holder of  certificates, if any,
representing the Exchangeable Shares held by  such  holder together with
such other documents and instruments as may  be  required to effect a
transfer of Exchangeable Shares and such additional  documents and
instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require  and  the holder
shall on and after the Liquidation Date be considered  and  deemed for all
purposes to be the holder of the shares of Spinco  Common  Stock to which it
is entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent  of a  certificate or
certificates, if any, representing Exchangeable Shares,  together with such
other documents and instruments as may be required  to  effect a transfer of
Exchangeable Shares and such additional documents  and  instruments as the
Transfer Agent may reasonably require, such holder  shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer  Agent  on behalf of Newco
Canada shall deliver to such holder the shares  of  Spinco Common Stock to
which the holder is entitled (either in the  form of  a certificate or, in
whole or in part, in book-entry form through  the  direct registration
system) and a cheque or cheques of Newco Canada  payable at par at any branch
of the bankers of Newco Canada in payment  of  the remaining portion, if
any, of the total Liquidation Call Purchase  Price, less any amounts withheld
pursuant to section 4.6.  If Newco Canada does not exercise the Liquidation
Call Right in the  manner  described above, then on the Liquidation Date the
holders of the  Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor  the  Liquidation Amount otherwise payable by Newco Canada
Exchangeco in  connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of
Newco  Canada  Exchangeco pursuant to Article 3.5  of  the Exchangeable
Share Provisions.

**5.2** **Newco  Canada Redemption Call Right**

 

 

In  addition to Newco Canada's rights contained in the Exchangeable Share 
Provisions, including, without limitation, the Retraction Call Right (as 
defined  in the Exchangeable Share Provisions), Newco Canada shall have the
following  rights in respect of the Exchangeable Shares:

 

 

 

 

       (a)   |  

Newco  Canada shall have the overriding right (the " **Redemption  Call
Right** "),  notwithstanding the proposed redemption of the Exchangeable
Shares  by  Newco Canada Exchangeco pursuant to Article 3.7  of  the
Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase from all but not less  than  all
of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder  of 
Exchangeable Shares which is a subsidiary of Spinco) on the Redemption  Date
all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by  each  such
holder on payment by Newco Canada to each holder of an amount  per 
Exchangeable Share (the " **Redemption  Call Purchase Price** ")  equal to
the Current Market Price of a share of Spinco Common Stock  on the  last
Business Day prior to the Redemption Date, which shall be satisfied  in full
by Newco Canada causing to be delivered to such holder one  share  of Spinco
Common Stock, plus the Dividend Amount. In the event of  the  exercise of
the Redemption Call Right by Newco Canada, each holder  shall  be obligated
to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder  to  Newco Canada on
the Redemption Date on payment by Newco Canada to  the  holder of the
Redemption Call Purchase Price for each such share,  and  Newco Canada
Exchangeco shall have no obligation to redeem, or to  pay any  Dividend
Amount in respect of, such shares so purchased by Newco  Canada.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

To  exercise the Redemption Call Right, Newco Canada must notify the 
Transfer  Agent, as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares, and Newco 
Canada  Exchangeco of Newco Canada's intention to exercise such right at
least 60  days before the Redemption Date, except in the case of a
redemption  occurring as a result of a Spinco Control Transaction, an
Exchangeable  Share Voting Event or an Exempt Exchangeable Share Voting Event
(each  as  defined in the Exchangeable Share Provisions), in which case
Newco  Canada  shall so notify the Transfer Agent and Newco Canada
Exchangeco on  or  before the Redemption Date. The Transfer Agent will
notify the holders  of  the Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Newco
Canada has exercised  the Redemption Call Right forthwith after the expiry of
the period  during  which the same may be exercised by Newco Canada. If
Newco Canada  exercises  the Redemption Call Right, on the Redemption Date
Newco Canada will  purchase and the holders will sell all of the Exchangeable
Shares  then  outstanding for a price per share equal to the Redemption Call
Purchase  Price.

       (c)   |  

For  the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable Shares 
pursuant to the Redemption Call Right, Newco Canada shall deposit  with the 
Transfer Agent, on or before the Redemption Date, one single certificate 
representing the aggregate number of shares of Spinco Common Stock 
deliverable by Newco Canada and a cheque or cheques of Newco Canada  payable
at par at any branch of the bankers of Newco Canada representing  the
aggregate Dividend Amount, if any, in payment of the total Redemption  Call
Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld pursuant to  section 4.6. 
Provided that Newco Canada has complied with the immediately preceding 
sentence, on and after the Redemption Date the rights of each holder  of 
Exchangeable Shares will be limited to receiving such holder's  proportionate
part of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price payable  by  Newco Canada
upon presentation and surrender by the holder of  certificates, if any,
representing the Exchangeable Shares held by  such  holder together with
such other documents and instruments as may  be  required to effect a
transfer of Exchangeable Shares and such additional  document and instruments
as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require  and  the holder shall on and
after the Redemption Date be considered and  deemed  for all purposes to be
the holder of the shares of Spinco Common  Stock to  which it is entitled.
Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a  certificate or certificates, if
any, representing Exchangeable Shares,  together with such other documents
and instruments as may be required  to  effect a transfer of Exchangeable
Shares and such additional documents  and  instruments as the Transfer Agent
may reasonably require, such holder  shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and the Transfer  Agent  on behalf of Newco Canada shall deliver
to such holder, the shares  of  Spinco Common Stock to which the holder is
entitled (either in the  form of  a certificate or, in whole or in part, in
book-entry form through  the  direct registration system) and a cheque or
cheques of Newco Canada  payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Newco
Canada in payment  of  the remaining portion, if any, of the total
Redemption Call Purchase  Price, less any amounts withheld pursuant to
section 4.6.  If Newco Canada does not exercise the Redemption Call Right in
the  manner  described above, then on the Redemption Date the holders of
the  Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor 
the  redemption price otherwise payable by Newco Canada Exchangeco in 
connection with the redemption of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant  to 
Article 3.7  of  the Exchangeable Share Provisions.

**5.3** **Fractional  Shares**

 

 

As  soon  as practicable after any exchange by a holder of any Exchangeable
Shares  pursuant to this Article 5,  Newco  Canada shall direct the
Transfer Agent (i) to determine the number, if any,  of whole and fractional
shares of Spinco Common Stock allocable to such holder,  (ii) to aggregate
all such fractional shares and sell the whole shares  obtained thereby at the
direction of the Corporation either in open market  transactions or
otherwise, in each case at then prevailing trading prices,  and  (iii) to
cause to be distributed to such holder in lieu of any fractional  share, such
holder's rateable share of the proceeds of such sale, after making 
appropriate deductions of the amount required to be withheld for tax
purposes  and after deducting an amount equal to all brokerage charges,
commissions and  transfer taxes attributed to such sale.

time specified for redemption,  send by facsimile, e-mail or other form of
electronic communication which  provides for receipt confirmation, to each
person who at the date of sending  is  a registered holder of Preference
Shares to be redeemed, a notice in writing  (a " **notice  of redemption**
")  of the  intention of the Corporation to redeem such Preference Shares.
The notice of  redemption shall set out the redemption price and the time and
date on which  redemption is to take place and, if only part of the shares
held by the  shareholder to whom it is addressed is to be redeemed, the

redemption, the Corporation  shall pay or cause to be paid to or to the order

redemption price thereof on  presentation and surrender of the certificate(s)
representing the Preference  Shares called for redemption at the registered

of redemption, the  Preference Shares called for redemption shall cease to be
entitled to dividends  and the holders thereof shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the rights  of  shareholders in respect thereof unless

surrendered by the registered  holders thereof in connection with such
redemption, to a special account in  a  specified chartered bank or a
specified trust company in Canada, named in such  notice of redemption, to be
paid without interest to or to the order of the  respective registered
holders of such Preference Shares called for redemption  upon presentation
and surrender to such bank or trust company of the  certificate(s)
representing the same and upon such deposit being made or upon  the date
specified for redemption in such notice, whichever is the later, the 
Preference Shares in respect whereof such deposit shall have been made shall 
be  deemed to be redeemed and the rights of the holders thereof after such
deposit  or such redemption date, as the case may be, shall be limited to
receiving  without interest their proportionate part of the total redemption
price so  deposited against presentation and surrender of the said
certificates held  by  them respectively. Any interest earned on any such
deposit shall belong to  the  Corporation. Redemption moneys that are
represented by a cheque which has not  been presented to the Corporation's
bankers for payment or that otherwise remain  unclaimed (including moneys
held on deposit to a special account as provided  for  above) for a period
of six years from the date specified for redemption shall  be  forfeited to
the Corporation.

 

 

2.6.4 In  the  event that only part of the Preference Shares is at any time
to be redeemed,  the  shares so to be redeemed shall be selected _pro

at the date of the notice  of redemption or in such other manner as the Board
of Directors in its sole  discretion may deem equitable.

determined by the Board of Directors on which the Corporation  shall have
sufficient moneys, assets or property properly applicable to the  payment of
such dividends.

hereof,  and each such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the
Corporation  and its shareholders. In making each such determination, the
following factors  shall, without excluding other factors determined by the
Board of Directors  to  be relevant, be considered by the Board of
Directors:

 

 

       (a)   |

       (b)   |  

in  the case of the issuance or distribution of any rights, options or

exercise price of each such right, option or warrant and the Current  Market
Price;

class other than shares of Spinco Common Stock, any rights, options  or 
warrants other than those referred to in section 3.3.5(b)  above, any
evidences of indebtedness of Spinco or any assets of Spinco)  the
relationship between the fair market value (as determined by  the Board  of
Directors in the manner above contemplated) of such property to  be  issued
or distributed with respect to each outstanding share of Spinco  Common Stock
**** and  the Current Market Price; and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (d)   |  

in  the case of any subdivision, redivision or change of the then
outstanding  shares of Spinco Common Stock into a greater number of shares
of  Spinco  Common Stock or the reduction, combination, consolidation or
change  of the  then outstanding shares of Spinco Common Stock into a lesser
number  of  shares of Spinco Common Stock or any amalgamation, merger,
reorganization  or other transaction affecting Spinco Common Stock, the
effect thereof  upon the then outstanding Spinco Common  Stock.

**ARTICLE  3.4**

 

**CERTAIN  RESTRICTIONS**

 

 

3.4.1 So  long  as any of the Exchangeable Shares are outstanding, the
Corporation shall not  at  any time without, but may at any time with, the
approval of the holders of  the  Exchangeable Shares given as specified in
section 3.10.2  of these  share provisions:

 

 

       (a)   |  

pay  any dividends on the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior 
to  the Exchangeable Shares, other than stock dividends payable in Common 
Shares or any such other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable  Shares, 
as the case may be;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

redeem  or purchase or make any capital distribution in respect of Common 
Shares  or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable  Shares;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

redeem  or purchase any other shares of the Corporation ranking equally
with  the  Exchangeable Shares with respect to the payment of dividends or
on  any  liquidation distribution; or

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (d)   |  

issue  any Exchangeable Shares or any other shares of the Corporation
ranking  equally with, or superior to, the Exchangeable Shares other than

---|--- 
    

 

 

The  restrictions in sections 3.4.1(a),  (b),  (c),  and (d)  above 
shall not apply if all dividends on the outstanding Exchangeable Shares 
corresponding to dividends declared and paid to date on the shares of Spinco 
Common Stock shall have been declared and paid on the Exchangeable  Shares.

 

 

**ARTICLE  3.5**

 

**DISTRIBUTION  ON LIQUIDATION**

 

 

3.5.1 In  the  event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the
Corporation or any  other distribution of the assets of the Corporation among
its shareholders  for  the purpose of winding up its affairs, a holder of
Exchangeable Shares shall  be  entitled, subject to applicable law, to
receive from the assets of the  Corporation in respect of each Exchangeable
Share held by such holder on the  effective date (the **" Liquidation 
Date"**)  of such  liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, before any
distribution of any part  of  the assets of the Corporation among the
holders of the Common Shares or any  other shares ranking junior to the
Exchangeable Shares, an amount per  Exchangeable Share (the **" Liquidation 
Amount"**)  equal  to the Current Market Price of a share of Spinco Common
Stock on the last  Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which shall be
satisfied in full  by  the Corporation causing to be delivered to such
holder, for each such  Exchangeable Share, one share of Spinco Common Stock
plus an amount equal to  all  declared and unpaid dividends on each such
Exchangeable Share held by such  holder on any dividend record date which
occurred prior to the Liquidation  Date.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D-32  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.5.2 On  or  promptly after the Liquidation Date, and subject to the
exercise by Newco Canada  of the Liquidation Call Right, the Corporation
shall cause to be delivered  to  the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the
Liquidation Amount for each such  Exchangeable Share upon presentation and
surrender of the certificates  representing such Exchangeable Shares, if any,
together with such other  documents and instruments as may be required to
effect a transfer of such  Exchangeable Shares and such additional documents
and instruments as the  Transfer Agent and the Corporation may reasonably
require, at the registered  office of the Corporation or at any office of the
Transfer Agent as may be  specified by the Corporation by notice to the
holders of the Exchangeable  Shares. Payment of the total Liquidation Amount
for such Exchangeable Shares  shall be made by delivery to each holder, at
the address of the holder recorded  in the securities register of the
Corporation for the Exchangeable Shares or  by  holding for pick-up by the
holder at the registered office of the Corporation  or  at any office of the
Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation  by  notice to the
holders of Exchangeable Shares, on behalf of the Corporation,  of  the
shares of Spinco Common Stock to which the holder is entitled (which shares 
shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and 
clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance), either in the form of certificates 
representing the shares of Spinco Common Stock or, in whole or in part, in 
book-entry form through the direct registration system and, if applicable, 
a  cheque of the Corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of
the  Corporation in respect of the remaining portion, if any, of the total 
Liquidation Amount (in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax 
required to be deducted and withheld therefrom). On and after the
Liquidation  Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be
holders of such  Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise
any of the rights  of  holders in respect thereof, other than the right to
receive their proportionate  part of the total Liquidation Amount, unless
payment of the total Liquidation  Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall
not be made upon presentation and  surrender of the documents and instruments
required in accordance with the  foregoing provisions, in which case the
rights of the holders shall remain  unaffected until the total Liquidation
Amount has been paid in the manner  hereinbefore provided. The Corporation
shall have the right at any time after  the Liquidation Date to deposit or
cause to be deposited the total Liquidation  Amount in a custodial account
with any chartered bank or trust company in  Canada. Upon such deposit being
made, the rights of the holders of Exchangeable  Shares after such deposit
shall be limited to receiving their proportionate  part  of the total
Liquidation Amount (in each case less any amounts withheld on  account of tax
required to be deducted and withheld therefrom) for such  Exchangeable Shares
so deposited, against presentation and surrender of the  required documents
and instruments in accordance with the foregoing provisions.  Upon such
payment or deposit of the total Liquidation Amount, the holders of  the 
Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all
purposes  to be holders of the shares of Spinco Common Stock delivered to
them or the  custodian on their behalf.

 

 

3.5.3 After  the  Corporation has satisfied its obligations to pay the
holders of the Exchangeable  Shares the Liquidation Amount per Exchangeable
Share pursuant to  section 3.5.1  of these  share provisions, such holders
shall not be entitled to share in any further  distribution of the assets of
the Corporation.

 

 

**ARTICLE  3.6**

 

**RETRACTION  OF EXCHANGEABLE SHARES BY HOLDER**

 

 

3.6.1 A  holder  of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled at any time,
subject to the exercise  by  Newco Canada of the Retraction Call Right and
otherwise upon compliance with  the  provisions of this Article 3.6,  to 
require the Corporation to redeem any or all of the Exchangeable Shares 
registered in the name of such holder for an amount per Exchangeable Share 
equal  to the Current Market Price of a share of Spinco Common Stock on the
last  Business Day prior to the Retraction Date (the " **Retraction  Price**
"),  which  shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation causing to be
delivered to such  holder, for each Exchangeable Share presented and
surrendered by the holder,  one  share of Spinco Common Stock. To effect
such redemption, the holder shall  present and surrender at the registered
office of the Corporation or at any  office of the Transfer Agent as may be
specified by the Corporation by notice  to  the holders of Exchangeable
Shares the certificate or certificates, if any,  representing the
Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to have the  Corporation redeem,
together with such other documents and instruments as may  be  required to
effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares and such additional  documents and
instruments as the Transfer Agent and the Corporation may  reasonably
require, and together with a duly executed statement (the " **Retraction 
Request** ")  in the  form of Schedule A hereto or in such other form as may
be acceptable to the  Corporation:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D-33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

       (a)   |  

specifying  that the holder desires to have all or any number specified
therein  of the  Exchangeable Shares represented by such certificate or
certificates  (the  " **Retracted  Shares** ")  redeemed by the
Corporation;

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

stating  the Business Day on which the holder desires to have the
Corporation  redeem the Retracted Shares (the " **Retraction  Date** "), 
provided that the Retraction Date shall be not less than 10 Business  Days 
nor more than 15 Business Days after the date on which the Retraction 
Request is received by the Corporation and further provided that,  in the 
event that no such Business Day is specified by the holder in the  Retraction
Request, the Retraction Date shall be deemed to be the  15th  Business Day
after the date on which the Retraction Request is received  by  the
Corporation; and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

acknowledging  the overriding right (the " **Retraction  Call Right** ") 
of Newco Canada to purchase all but not less than all the Retracted  Shares 
directly from the holder and that the Retraction Request shall be  deemed 
to be a revocable offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares  to 
Newco Canada in accordance with the Retraction Call Right on the  terms and 
conditions set out in section 3.6.3  below.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

3.6.2 Subject  to the exercise by Newco Canada of the Retraction Call Right,
upon receipt  by  the Corporation or the Transfer Agent in the manner
specified in  section 3.6.1  hereof  of a certificate or certificates, if
any, representing the number of Retracted  Shares, together with a Retraction
Request and the other documents and  instruments required in accordance with
section 3.6.1,  and  provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by
the holder in the manner  specified in section 3.6.7,  the  Corporation
shall redeem the Retracted Shares effective at the close of business  on the
Retraction Date and shall cause to be delivered to such holder the total 
Retraction Price. If only a part of the Exchangeable Shares is redeemed (or 
purchased by Newco Canada pursuant to the Retraction Call Right), the holder 
thereof shall receive at the expense of the Corporation (either in the form 
of a  certificate, or in book-entry form through the direct registration
system)  the  balance of such Exchangeable Shares.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D-34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.6.3 Upon  receipt by the Corporation of a Retraction Request, the
Corporation shall  immediately notify Newco Canada thereof and shall provide
to Newco Canada a  copy  of the Retraction Request. In order to exercise the
Retraction Call Right,  Newco  Canada must notify the Corporation of its
determination to do so (the " **Newco  Canada Call Notice** ")  within 
five Business Days of notification to Newco Canada by the Corporation of the 
receipt by the Corporation of the Retraction Request. If Newco Canada does 
not  so notify the Corporation within such five Business Day period, the
Corporation  will notify the holder as soon as possible thereafter that Newco
Canada will  not  exercise the Retraction Call Right. If Newco Canada
delivers the Newco Canada  Call Notice within such five Business Day period,
and provided that the  Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the
manner specified in  section 3.6.7,  the  Retraction Request shall
thereupon be considered only to be an offer by the  holder to sell the
Retracted Shares to Newco Canada in accordance with the  Retraction Call
Right. In such event, the Corporation shall not redeem the  Retracted Shares
and Newco Canada shall purchase from such holder and such  holder shall sell
to Newco Canada on the Retraction Date the Retracted Shares  for a purchase
price (the " **Purchase  Price** ")  per  share equal to the Retraction
Price per share, plus on the designated payment  date therefor, to the extent
not paid by the Corporation on the designated  payment date therefor, any
Dividend Amount. To the extent that Newco Canada  pays  the Dividend Amount
in respect of the Retracted Shares, the Corporation shall  no  longer be
obligated to pay any declared and unpaid dividends on such Retracted  Shares.
Provided that Newco Canada has complied with section 3.6.4,  the  closing of
the purchase and sale of the Retracted Shares pursuant to the  Retraction
Call Right shall be deemed to have occurred as at the close of  business on
the Retraction Date and, for greater certainty, no redemption by  the 
Corporation of such Retracted Shares shall take place on the Retraction
Date.  In  the event that Newco Canada does not deliver a Newco Canada Call
Notice within  such five Business Day period, and provided that the
Retraction Request is  not  revoked by the holder in the manner specified in
section 3.6.7,  the  Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares on the
Retraction Date and in  the  manner otherwise contemplated in this Article
3.6.

 

 

3.6.4 The  Corporation or Newco Canada, as the case may be, shall deliver or
cause the  Transfer Agent to deliver to the relevant holder, at the address
of the holder  recorded in the securities register of the Corporation for the
Exchangeable  Shares or at the address specified in the holder's Retraction
Request or by  holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of
the Corporation  or  at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified
by the Corporation  by  notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares, the
shares of Spinco Common Stock  to which the holder is entitled (which shares
shall be duly issued as fully  paid  and non-assessable and shall be free
and clear of any lien, claim or  encumbrance), either in the form of
certificates representing the shares of  Spinco Common Stock registered in
the name of the holder or in such other name  as the holder may request or,
in whole or in part, in book-entry form through  the direct registration
system, and, if applicable and on or before the payment  date therefor, a
cheque payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the  Corporation or
Newco Canada, as applicable, representing the aggregate Dividend  Amount, in
payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price,  as  the
case may be, in each case, less any amounts withheld on account of tax 
required to be deducted and withheld therefrom, and such delivery of such
shares  of Spinco Common Stock and cheques on behalf of the Corporation or by
Newco  Canada, as the case may be, or by the Transfer Agent shall be deemed
to be  payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the
total  Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, to the
extent  that  the same is represented by such shares of Spinco Common Stock
and cheques (plus  any tax deducted and withheld therefrom and remitted to
the proper tax  authority).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D-35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.6.5 On  and  after the close of business on the Retraction Date, the
holder of the Retracted  Shares shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted
Shares and shall not be  entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder
in respect thereof, other  than the right to receive his proportionate part
of the total Retraction Price  or total Purchase Price, as the case may be,
unless upon presentation and  surrender of the documents and instruments in
accordance with the foregoing  provisions, payment of the total Retraction
Price or the total Purchase Price,  as the case may be, shall not be made as
provided in section 3.6.4,  in  which case the rights of such holder shall
remain unaffected until the total  Retraction Price or the total Purchase
Price, as the case may be, has been  paid  in the manner hereinbefore
provided. On and after the close of business on  the  Retraction Date,
provided that presentation and surrender of the documents  and  instruments
in accordance with the foregoing provisions and payment of the  total 
Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been 
made  in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the
Retracted Shares  so redeemed by the Corporation or purchased by Newco Canada
shall thereafter  be  considered and deemed for all purposes to be a holder
of the shares of Spinco  Common Stock delivered to it.

 

 

3.6.6 Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Article 3.6,  the 
Corporation shall not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by 
a  holder in a Retraction Request to the extent that such redemption of
Retracted  Shares would be contrary to solvency requirements or other
provisions of  applicable law. If the Corporation believes that on any
Retraction Date it  would  not be permitted by any of such provisions to
redeem the Retracted Shares  tendered for redemption on such date, and
provided that Newco Canada shall  not  have exercised the Retraction Call
Right with respect to the Retracted Shares,  the Corporation shall only be
obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified  by  a holder in a Retraction
Request to the extent of the maximum number that may  be  so redeemed
(rounded down to a whole number of shares) as would not be contrary  to such
provisions and shall notify the holder and the Trustee at least two  Business
Days prior to the Retraction Date as to the number of Retracted Shares  which
will not be redeemed by the Corporation. In any case in which the  redemption
by the Corporation of Retracted Shares would be contrary to solvency 
requirements or other provisions of applicable law, the Corporation shall
redeem  Retracted Shares in accordance with section 3.6.2  of these  share
provisions on a _pro  rata_   basis  and the holder of Retracted Shares
shall receive at the Corporation's expense  (either in the form of a
certificate or in book-entry form through the direct  registration system)
the Retracted Shares not redeemed by the Corporation  pursuant to section
3.6.2.  Provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in
the manner  specified in section 3.6.7,  the  holder of any such Retracted
Shares not redeemed by the Corporation pursuant  to  section 3.6.2  of
these  share provisions as a result of solvency requirements or other
provisions of  applicable law shall be deemed by giving the Retraction
Request to require  Newco  Canada, to purchase such Retracted Shares from
such holder on the Retraction  Date or as soon as practicable thereafter on
payment by Newco Canada as the  case  may be, to such holder of the Purchase
Price for each such Retracted Share,  all  as more specifically provided in
the Voting and Exchange Trust  Agreement.

 

 

3.6.7 A  holder  of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given by the
holder to the  Corporation before the close of business on the Business Day
immediately  preceding the Retraction Date, withdraw its Retraction Request,
in which event  such Retraction Request shall be null and void and, for
greater certainty,  the  revocable offer constituted by the Retraction
Request to sell the Retracted  Shares to Newco Canada shall be deemed to have
been revoked.

**ARTICLE  3.7**

 

**REDEMPTION  OF EXCHANGEABLE SHARES BY THE CORPORATION**

 

 

3.7.1 Subject  to applicable law, and provided Newco Canada has not exercised
the Redemption  Call Right, the Corporation shall on the Redemption Date
redeem all but not  less  than all of the then outstanding Exchangeable
Shares for an amount per  Exchangeable Share equal to the Current Market
Price of a share of Spinco Common  Stock on the last Business Day prior to
the Redemption Date (the " **Redemption  Price** "),  which  shall be
satisfied in full by the Corporation causing to be delivered to each  holder
of Exchangeable Shares, for each Exchangeable Share held by such holder,  one
share of Spinco Common Stock, together with the full amount of all declared 
and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on 
any  dividend record date which occurred prior to the Redemption Date.

 

 

3.7.2 In  any  case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares under this
Article 3.7,  the  Corporation shall, at least 60 days before the Redemption
Date (other than  a  Redemption Date established in connection with a Spinco
Control Transaction,  an  Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt
Exchangeable Share Voting Event),  send or cause to be sent to each holder of
Exchangeable Shares a notice in  writing of the redemption by the Corporation
or the purchase by Newco Canada  under the Redemption Call Right, as the case
may be, of the Exchangeable Shares  held by such holder. In the case of a
Redemption Date established in connection  with a Spinco Control Transaction,
an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an  Exempt Exchangeable Share Voting
Event, the written notice of redemption by  the  Corporation or the purchase
by Newco Canada under the Redemption Call Right  will  be sent on or before
the Redemption Date, on as many days prior written notice  as may be
determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation to be  reasonably
practicable in the circumstances. In any such case, such notice  shall  set
out the formula for determining the Redemption Price or the Redemption 
Call  Purchase Price, as the case may be, the Redemption Date and, if
applicable,  particulars of the Redemption Call Right.

 

 

3.7.3 On  or  after the Redemption Date and subject to the exercise by Newco
Canada of the  Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall cause to be
delivered to the  holders of the Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed the
Redemption Price for  each  such Exchangeable Share, if any, together with
the full amount of all declared  and unpaid dividends on each such
Exchangeable Share held by such holder on  any  dividend record date which
occurred prior to the Redemption Date, upon  presentation and surrender at
the registered office of the Corporation or at  any  office of the Transfer
Agent as may be specified by the Corporation in such  notice of the
certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares, if any,  together with
such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect  a transfer
of Exchangeable Shares and such additional documents and instruments  as the
Transfer Agent and the Corporation may reasonably require. Payment of  the 
total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares, together with payment 
of  such dividends, shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address
of  the  holder recorded in the securities register of the Corporation or by
holding  for  pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the
Corporation or at any  office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by
the Corporation in such  notice, on behalf of the Corporation, of the shares
of Spinco Common Stock  to  which the holder is entitled (which shares shall
be duly issued as fully paid  and non-assessable and shall be free and clear
of any lien, claim or  encumbrance), either in the form of certificates
representing the shares of  Spinco Common Stock or, in whole or in part, in
book-entry form through the  direct registration system, and, if applicable,
a cheque of the Corporation  payable at par at any branch of the bankers of
the Corporation in payment of  any  such dividends, in each case, less any
amounts withheld on account of tax  required to be deducted and withheld
therefrom. On and after the Redemption  Date, the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares called for redemption shall cease  to be holders of such Exchangeable
Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise  any of the rights of holders in
respect thereof, other than the right to receive  their proportionate part of
the total Redemption Price and any such dividends,  unless payment of the
total Redemption Price and any such dividends for such  Exchangeable Shares
shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of the  documents and
instruments required in accordance with the foregoing provisions,  in which
case the rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the total 
Redemption Price and any such dividends have been paid in the manner 
hereinbefore provided. The Corporation shall have the right at any time
after  the sending of notice of its intention to redeem the Exchangeable
Shares as  aforesaid to deposit or cause to be deposited the total Redemption
Price for  and  the full amount of such dividends on (except as otherwise
provided in this  section 3.7.3)  the  Exchangeable Shares so called for
redemption, in a custodial account with any  chartered bank or trust company
in Canada named in such notice, less any amounts  withheld on account of tax
required to be deducted and withheld therefrom.  Upon  the later of such
deposit being made and the Redemption Date, the Exchangeable  Shares in
respect whereof such deposit shall have been made shall be redeemed  and the
rights of the holders thereof after such deposit or Redemption Date,  as 
the case may be, shall be limited to receiving their proportionate part of 
the  total Redemption Price and such dividends for such Exchangeable Shares
so called  for redemption, against presentation and surrender of the
documents and  instruments required in accordance with the foregoing
provisions. Upon such  payment or deposit of the total Redemption Price and
the full amount of such  dividends, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares
shall thereafter be considered  and deemed for all purposes to be holders of
the shares of Spinco Common Stock  delivered to them or the custodian on
their behalf.

**ARTICLE  3.8**

 

**PURCHASE  FOR CANCELLATION**

 

 

3.8.1 Subject  to applicable law and notwithstanding section 3.8.2,  the 
Corporation may at any time and from time to time purchase for cancellation 
all  or any part of the Exchangeable Shares by private agreement with any
holder  of  Exchangeable Shares for consideration consisting of Common
Shares.

 

 

3.8.2 Subject  to applicable law, the Corporation may at any time and from
time to time  purchase for cancellation all or any part of the outstanding
Exchangeable Shares  at any price by tender to all the holders of record of
Exchangeable Shares  then  outstanding or through the facilities of any
stock exchange on which the  Exchangeable Shares are listed or quoted at any
price per share. If in response  to an invitation for tenders under the
provisions of this  section 3.8.2,  more  Exchangeable Shares are tendered
at a price or prices acceptable to the  Corporation than the Corporation is
prepared to purchase, the Exchangeable  Shares to be purchased by the
Corporation shall be purchased as nearly as may  be  _pro  rata_  
according to the number of shares tendered by each holder who submits a
tender  to the Corporation, provided that when shares are tendered at
different prices,  the pro rating shall be effected (disregarding fractions)
only with respect  to  the shares tendered at the price at which more shares
were tendered than the  Corporation is prepared to purchase after the
Corporation has purchased all  the  shares tendered at lower prices. If part
only of the Exchangeable Shares shall  be purchased, the holder thereof shall
receive at the expense of the Corporation  (either in the form of a
certificate or in book-entry form through the direct  registration system)
the balance of such shares.

 

 

**ARTICLE  3.9**

 

**VOTING  RIGHTS**

 

 

3.9.1 Except  as  required by applicable law and by Article 3.10  hereof, 
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall not be entitled as such to
receive  notice of or to attend any meeting of the shareholders of the
Corporation or  to  vote at any such meeting.

**ARTICLE  3.10**

 

**AMENDMENT  AND APPROVAL**

 

 

3.10.1 The  rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to the
Exchangeable  Shares may be added to, changed or removed but only with the
approval of the  holders of the Exchangeable Shares given as hereinafter
specified, provided  that  any adjustment to the number of shares of Spinco
Common Stock into which an  Exchangeable Share is exchangeable (which
initially is one) made by the Board  of  Directors in accordance with
section 2.7 of the Support Agreement to  reflect the effect of any
Distribution or Change in order to implement the  required economic
equivalent with respect to the shares of Spinco Common Stock  and the
Exchangeable Shares shall not require the approval of the holders of  the

       2.1   |  

Subject  to Article 11,  the term of this Agreement shall be for the
Transition Period.  The term  for each Service is specified on the
applicable Schedule hereto  setting  forth the terms and conditions for such
Service. It is understood  by the  Parties that the scope of the services
and cost estimates described  in the  schedules hereto do not include Newco
facilities at Ear Falls,  Ontario,  and Big River, Saskatchewan and
operations related to the Forest  Licenses  (as defined in the Contribution
and Distribution Agreement). The  Service  Provider agrees to provide
Services for the Ear Falls, Big River  and  operations related to the Forest
Licenses at fully allocated cost  on the  terms specified herein.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       2.2   |  

During  the Transition Period, but subject to Article 11  and the provisions
set forth in this Agreement, the Service Provider  shall  provide the
Services to the Service  Recipient.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       2.3   |  

The  Service Provider shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the 
Service  Recipient Services that are of substantially the same nature and 
quality  that Weyerhaeuser and Weyerhaeuser Canada provided for the Newco 
Business  during the twelve-month period prior to the Effective Time  (and
which shall be of substantially the same nature and quality  that 
Weyerhaeuser and Weyerhaeuser Canada provide to themselves), at 
substantially the same priority levels that such Services have  been 
accorded during such twelve-month period. The quantity of a particular 
Service provided by the Service Provider shall be the quantity  identified 
for such Service in the applicable Schedule to this  Agreement.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       2.4   |  

The  Service Provider shall not be obligated to perform services other  than
the  Services described in the Schedules hereto. The  Service Recipient may,
from time to time, request that the Service  Provider provide additional
services during the Transition Period  relating  to Government legislated
change, customer requirements, shipping/custom  changes, functional
enhancements, interface development or changes  or  converting to another
platform or application (" **Requested  Services** ").  The Service Provider
shall submit to the Service Recipient a written  proposal to provide such
Requested Services itself or through a  third  party setting forth each
Requested Service to be performed, the  time  period for performance of such
Requested Service and the amounts  to be  charged for performance of such
Requested Service, which amounts  shall be  based on the Service Provider's
fully allocated cost including the fees of  any third party provider.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       2.5   |  

The  Service Provider shall not be obligated to perform services other  than

may,  from time to time, request that the Service Provider provide
additional  services during the Transaction Period (" **Additional 
Services** ").  The Service Provider shall consider each request for
Additional  Services  in good faith, and if the Service Provider determines
that it is  prepared  to provide the Service Recipient with all or a portion
of the Additional  Services identified in the request, it shall submit to the
Service  Recipient a written proposal to provide such Additional Services 
itself or  through a third party setting forth  

each  Additional Service to be performed, the time period for performance 
of  such Additional Service, and the amounts to be charged for performance 
of  such Additional Service, which amounts shall be based on the  Service 
Provider's fully allocated cost including the fees of any third party 
provider.

       2.6   |  

Weyerhaeuser  and Weyerhaeuser Canada may use third parties to provide some
or  all of  the Services to the extent they use such third parties
themselves  with  respect to the provision of such services for their own
businesses.  In  addition, Weyerhaeuser and Weyerhaeuser Canada may provide
to Service  Recipient third party proposals for the provision of Services
provided  by  Weyerhaeuser and Weyerhaeuser Canada hereunder and Service
Recipient  agrees to consider such proposals in good faith. The Service
Provider  shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent,
where  necessary, of any relevant third party provider of the Services  to
have  such Services be provided to the Service Recipient. If such consent 
cannot  be obtained, the Service Provider shall arrange for alternative 
methods of  delivering the Service for which it is responsible hereunder.
The  Service  Recipient will cooperate with and assist Weyerhaeuser and
Weyerhaeuser  Canada to obtain such consents; _provided_   that nothing in
this Section 2.6 shall require the Service Recipient  to pay any
consideration for obtaining any necessary consents or  such  alternative
methods greater than the cost for such Service specified  on  the applicable
Schedules or require Weyerhaeuser and Weyerhaeuser  Canada  to pay any
consideration for obtaining any necessary consents which  is not  reimbursed
by Service Recipient pursuant to this Agreement. Weyerhaeuser  and
Weyerhaeuser Canada agree that to the extent such third party  Services  are
provided to Service Recipient pursuant to contracts between  Weyerhaeuser and
Weyerhaeuser Canada and the third party service  provided,  Weyerhaeuser and
Weyerhaeuser Canada will enforce rights against  any such  third parties
relating to the Services to the extent they would  otherwise  enforce such
rights on behalf of themselves under similar circumstances  relating to
similar matters.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       2.7   |  

In  the event of any breach of this Article 2  by  the Service Provider
with respect to any Service and provided that  the  Service Recipient is not
in breach of its obligations under Articles  3 and  4, the Service Provider
shall, at the Service Recipient's request, without  the payment of any
further fees by the Service Recipient, correct  or cause  to be corrected
such error or defect or reperform or cause to be  reperformed such Service,
as promptly as practicable, and cause  such  Service to be provided
thereafter in conformity with the standard  set  forth in Section 2.3.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       2.8   |  

The  Service Provider shall at all times maintain contingency plans  in
place to  reasonably address disruptions in the Services. If a disruption 
of any  Service occurs, the Service Provider shall use the same standard  of
care  it uses to operate, support and recover its own systems in the  case
of a  disruption.

       2.9   |  

Weyerhaeuser  shall lease office space to Newco and Newco Canada Exchangeco
in  Federal  Way, Washington near Weyerhaeuser's headquarters in the
vicinity of  Weyerhaeuser where its employees responsible for providing the 
Services  and completing the Transition-out are located, such space being 
sufficient  to provide office space for Newco's and Newco Canada
Exchangeco's  employees who, as reasonably determined  by Newco and Newco
Canada Exchangeco, need to be located at such  location  during the
Transition Period in order to ensure the successful  provision  of the
Services and the completion of the Transition-out. Such  lease shall  be on
reasonable market terms commensurate with the space  provided.

At  or prior to the end of the Transaction Period, at the request of 
East,  Weyerhaeuser shall purchase all hardware and equipment that is 
leased from  EDS and dedicated to providing the Services and shall transfer 
ownership  to Newco of all such hardware and equipment and all other
hardware  and  equipment that is used to provide the Services and previously
purchased  from EDS, in exchange for the payment to Weyerhaeuser by Newco 
of the book  value of all such hardware and equipment; provided, however,
that  Weyerhaeuser shall not be required to purchase and transfer to  Newco
any  hardware and equipment that is used in Weyerhaeuser's  business.

       3.2   |  

Charges  for Services shall be billed monthly by Weyerhaeuser and
Weyerhaeuser  Canada by no later than fifteen days after the end of the 
Weyerhaeuser Fiscal Month in which such Services are rendered **** and  shall

with the Services, the Parties further agree as  follows:

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (a)   |  

The  charge payable by the Service Recipient for any Service rendered 
during a  Weyerhaeuser Fiscal Month that is quoted on an annual or monthly 
fee basis  (as described on the applicable Schedule) shall be calculated by 
multiplying:

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (i)   |  

the  number of weeks during that Weyerhaeuser Fiscal Month in which  the
Service  Provider has provided that Service;  by

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (ii)   |  

1/52  of any fee quoted on an annual basis or 1/4 of any fee quoted on  a
monthly  basis based on the applicable fee for such Service as at the
beginning  of  that Weyerhaeuser Fiscal Month (net of any agreed prior
reductions  to such  fee).

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

The  charge payable by the Service Recipient for any Service rendered 
during a  Weyerhaeuser Fiscal Month that is quoted on a one-time or hourly 
fee basis  (as described on the applicable Schedule) shall be billed in the 
bill for  the month or months in which the cost for such Service is
incurred  or such  service is provided by the Service  Provider.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

For  the purposes of calculating the monthly charge described in sub-
paragraph  3.2(a) above, use during any portion of a week during a
Weyerhaeuser  Fiscal Month shall be deemed to constitute use during the
entirety  of that  week.

The  Service Provider and the Service Recipient shall, and shall cause
their  respective affiliates to, provide to each other and their respective
agents  and  vendors reasonable access (during normal business hours, upon
reasonable  notice  and supervised by the appropriate personnel of the
Parties) to the information,  personnel, and systems necessary for the
efficient and accurate administration  of each of the Services and to avoid
the duplication of any expenses or benefits  thereunder; _provided_ , 
that  all such information shall be shared subject to the confidentiality
obligations  set forth in Section 6.30 of the Transaction Agreement, and any
Party or  third  party vendor receiving such information shall agree to be
bound by such  obligations prior to the provision of any such information.

**TRANSITION**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       5.1   |  

The  Parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate  with
and  assist each other in order to permit the Transition-out to occur  as
soon  as reasonably practicable, but in any event prior to the end of  the 
obligation of the Service Provider to provide such Services hereunder, 
taking into account the need to minimize both the cost of the  Transition-out
and the disruption to the ongoing business activities  of  the Parties.
Weyerhaeuser and Weyerhaeuser Canada agree to provide  to the  Service
Recipient such support as reasonably necessary for the  Transition-out at the
hourly rates specified in Schedules A, B  and C  hereto, or if not specified
in such Schedules, then at actual cost.  The  Parties acknowledge that such
support may include the provision  of  services requested by the Service
Recipient in connection with  its  transition to non-Service Provider
systems, including but not limited  to  migration of historical data,
migration-specific enhancements and  cooperation with and assistance to third
party consultants engaged  by the  Service Recipient in connection with
the  foregoing.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       5.2   |  

It  is the intent of the parties that the Service Recipient will be  able
to  perform for itself the Services following the discontinuance of  such 
Services by the Service Provider. In furtherance of the foregoing,  the 
Service Provider agrees to cooperate with and assist the Service  Recipient 
with training of its personnel, including making its personnel  and 
facilities available to train an agreed number of the Service Recipient's 
personnel in connection with the Transition-Out to permit the Service 
Recipient to provide the Services for itself after the Transition  Period.

This  is a master agreement and shall be construed as a separate and

in either case in the event of the failure of the Service Recipient  to pay 
any invoice within thirty days of the receipt of such invoice or  upon any 
other material breach by the Service Recipient of this Agreement  with

changes  are made to the Exchangeable Shares, in order to implement the 
required  economic equivalent with respect to the shares of Spinco Common

into which an Exchangeable Share is exchangeable  (which initially is one) to
reflect the economic equivalent of  the  relationship between the shares of
Spinco Common Stock and the  Exchangeable Shares.

effective only upon, and shall  be  conditional upon, the closing of such
Offer and only to the extent necessary  to  tender or deposit to the Offer).

The  Exchange Right shall be and remain vested in and exercisable by the
Trustee.  Subject to section 7.15,  the  Trustee shall exercise the
Exchange Right only on the basis of instructions  received pursuant to this
Article 5  from  Beneficiaries entitled to instruct the Trustee as to the
exercise thereof.  To  the extent that no instructions are received from a
Beneficiary with respect  to  the Exchange Right, the Trustee shall not
exercise or permit the exercise  of the  Exchange Right.

**Purchase  Price**

The  purchase price payable by Newco Canada for each Exchangeable Share to
be  purchased by Newco Canada under the Exchange Right shall be an amount
per  Exchangeable Share equal to (a) the Current Market Price of a share of 
Spinco Common Stock on the last Business Day prior to the day of closing  of
the  purchase and sale of such Exchangeable Share under the Exchange Right,
which  shall be satisfied in full by Newco Canada causing to be sent to such
holder  one  share of Spinco Common Stock, plus (b) to the extent not paid
by Newco  Canada Exchangeco on the designated payment date therefor, an
additional  amount  equal to and in satisfaction of the full amount of all
declared and unpaid  dividends on each such Exchangeable Share held by such
holder on any dividend  record date which occurred prior to the closing of
the purchase and sale.  In  connection with each exercise of the Exchange
Right, Newco Canada shall provide  to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate
setting forth the calculation of the  purchase price for each Exchangeable
Share. The purchase price for each such  Exchangeable Share so purchased may
be satisfied only by Newco Canada delivering  or causing to be delivered to
the Trustee, on behalf of the relevant  Beneficiary, one share of Spinco
Common Stock and on the applicable payment  date  a cheque for the balance,
if any, of the purchase price without interest  (but  less any amounts
withheld pursuant to section 5.13).  Upon  payment by Newco Canada of such
purchase price, the relevant Beneficiary  shall  cease to have any right to
be paid any amount in respect of declared and  unpaid  dividends on each
such Exchangeable Share by Newco Canada  Exchangeco.

Subject  to the terms and conditions herein set forth, a Beneficiary shall be
entitled,  upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Insolvency
Event, to  instruct the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right with respect
to all or  any  part of the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of
such Beneficiary  on  the books of Newco Canada Exchangeco. To cause the
exercise of the Exchange  Right by the Trustee, the Beneficiary shall deliver
to the Trustee, in person  or  by certified or registered mail, at its
principal office in Montreal or at  such  other places in Canada as the
Trustee may from time to time designate by  written  notice to the
Beneficiaries, the certificates, if any, representing the  Exchangeable
Shares which such Beneficiary desires Newco Canada to purchase,  duly
endorsed in blank for transfer, and accompanied by such other documents 
and  instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable
Shares  and  such additional documents and instruments as the Trustee, Newco
Canada  Exchangeco, Spinco or Newco Canada may reasonably require together
with  (a) a duly completed form of notice of exercise of the Exchange Right
in  form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, Spinco, Newco Canada
and  Newco  Canada Exchangeco, stating (i) that the Beneficiary thereby
instructs the  Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right so as to require Newco
Canada to purchase  from the Beneficiary the number of Exchangeable Shares
specified therein,  (ii) that such Beneficiary has good title to and owns all
such Exchangeable  Shares to be acquired by Newco Canada, free and clear of
all liens, claims  and  encumbrances, (iii) the names in which the shares of
Spinco Common Stock  issuable in connection with the exercise of the Exchange
Right are to be  issued  and (iv) the names and addresses of the persons to
whom such shares of  Spinco Common Stock should be delivered and (b) payment
(or evidence  satisfactory to the Trustee, Newco Canada Exchangeco, Newco
Canada and Spinco  of  payment) of the taxes (if any) payable as
contemplated by  section 5.8  of this  Agreement. If only a part of the
Exchangeable Shares are to be purchased  by  Newco Canada under the Exchange
Right, the balance of such Exchangeable Shares  shall be issued to the holder
at the expense of Newco Canada Exchangeco either  by a new certificate or
through the direct registration system.

Promptly  after the receipt of the notice of exercise of the Exchange Right,
together  with  such documents and instruments of transfer required by
section 5.5  (and  payment of taxes, if any payable as contemplated by
section 5.8  or  evidence thereof), the Trustee shall notify Spinco, Newco
Canada and Newco  Canada Exchangeco of its receipt of the same, which notice
to Spinco, Newco  Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco shall constitute
exercise of the Exchange  Right by the Trustee on behalf of the holder of
such Exchangeable Shares,  and  Newco Canada shall promptly thereafter
deliver or cause to be delivered to  the  Trustee (which delivery may be in
the form of a certificate or in book-entry  form through the direct
registration system), for delivery to the Beneficiary  of  such Exchangeable
Shares (or to such other persons, if any, properly designated  by such
Beneficiary) the number of shares of Spinco Common Stock issuable  in 
connection with the exercise of the Exchange Right, and on the applicable 
payment date cheques for the balance, if any, of the total purchase price 
therefor without interest (but less any amounts withheld pursuant to  section
5.13);  provided, however, that no such delivery shall be made unless and
until the  Beneficiary requesting the same shall have paid (or provided
evidence  satisfactory to the Trustee, Newco Canada Exchangeco, Newco Canada
and Spinco  of  the payment of) the taxes (if any) payable as contemplated
by  section 5.8  of this  Agreement. Immediately upon the giving of notice
by the Trustee to Spinco,  Newco  Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco of the
exercise of the Exchange Right  as  provided in this section 5.6,  the 
closing of the transaction of purchase and sale contemplated by the Exchange 
Right shall be deemed to have occurred and the holder of such Exchangeable 
Shares shall be deemed to have transferred to Newco Canada, all of such
holder's  right, title and interest in and to such Exchangeable Shares and
the related  interest in the Trust Estate and shall cease to be a holder of
such Exchangeable  Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the
rights of a holder  in  respect thereof, other than the right to receive his
proportionate part of  the  total purchase price therefor, unless the
requisite number of shares of Spinco  Common Stock is not allotted, issued
and delivered by Newco Canada, to the  Trustee within five Business Days of
the date of the giving of such notice  by  the Trustee or the balance of the
purchase price, if any, is not paid by  Newco  Canada, on the applicable
payment date therefor, in which case the rights  of the  Beneficiary shall
remain unaffected until such shares of Spinco Common Stock  are  so
allotted, issued and delivered, and the balance of the purchase price,  if 
any, has been paid, by Newco Canada. Upon delivery by Newco Canada, to the 
Trustee of such shares of Spinco Common Stock, and the balance of the
purchase  price, if any, the Trustee shall deliver such shares of Spinco
Common Stock  to  such Beneficiary (or to such other persons, if any,
properly designated by  such  Beneficiary), either in the form of a
certificate or in book-entry form through  the direct registration system.
Concurrently with such Beneficiary ceasing  to be  a holder of Exchangeable
Shares, the Beneficiary shall be considered and  deemed  for all purposes to
be the holder of the shares of Spinco Common Stock delivered  to it pursuant
to the Exchange Right.

In  the  event that a Beneficiary has exercised its right under Article 3.6
of the  Exchangeable Share Provisions to require Newco Canada Exchangeco to
redeem  any  or all of the Exchangeable Shares held by the Beneficiary (the
**" Retracted  Shares"**)  and is  notified by Newco Canada Exchangeco
pursuant to section 3.6.6 of the  Exchangeable Share Provisions that Newco
Canada Exchangeco will not be permitted  as a result of solvency requirements
of applicable law to redeem all such  Retracted Shares, and provided that
Newco Canada shall not have exercised  the  Retraction Call Right with
respect to the Retracted Shares and that the  Beneficiary has not revoked the
retraction request delivered by the Beneficiary  to Newco Canada Exchangeco
pursuant to section 3.6.1 of the Exchangeable  Share Provisions and provided
further that the Trustee has received written  notice of same from Newco
Canada Exchangeco or Spinco, the retraction request  will constitute and will
be deemed to constitute notice from the Beneficiary  to  the Trustee
instructing the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right with respect  to those
Retracted Shares that Newco Canada Exchangeco is unable to redeem.  In  any
such event, Newco Canada Exchangeco hereby agrees with the Trustee and  in 
favour of the Beneficiary promptly to forward or cause to be forwarded to 
the  Trustee all relevant materials delivered by the Beneficiary to Newco
Canada  Exchangeco or to the transfer agent of the Exchangeable Shares
(including  without limitation, a copy of the retraction request delivered
pursuant to  section 3.6.1 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions) in
connection with such  proposed redemption of the Retracted Shares and the
Trustee will thereupon  exercise the Exchange Right with respect to the
Retracted Shares that Newco  Canada Exchangeco is not permitted to redeem and
will require Newco Canada  to  purchase such shares in accordance with the
provisions of this Article 5.

Upon  any  sale of Exchangeable Shares to Newco Canada pursuant to the

Common Stock to be delivered  in connection with the payment of the total
purchase price therefor shall  be  issued in the name of the Beneficiary of

Trustee shall be required to pay) any documentary, stamp,  transfer or other
taxes that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved  in the
issuance or delivery of such shares to a person other than such  Beneficiary
or (b) shall have evidenced to the satisfaction of the Trustee,  Spinco,
Newco Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco that such taxes, if any,  have 
been paid.

Exchangeco, an  additional amount equal to and in satisfaction of the full 
amount of all  declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable 
Share held by such  holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior

automatic exchange  of Exchangeable  Shares for shares of Spinco Common
Stock shall be deemed  to have occurred,  and each Beneficiary shall be
deemed to have transferred  to Newco Canada,  all of the Beneficiary's
right, title and interest in and to such  Beneficiary's Exchangeable Shares
and the related interest in the  Trust  Estate, any right of each such
Beneficiary to receive  declared and unpaid  dividends from Newco Canada
Exchangeco shall be deemed  to be satisfied and  discharged and each such
Beneficiary shall cease to  be a holder of such  Exchangeable Shares and
Newco Canada, shall deliver  to the Beneficiary the  shares of Spinco Common
Stock issuable upon the automatic  exchange of  Exchangeable Shares for
shares of Spinco Common Stock  and on the  applicable payment date shall
deliver to the Trustee  for delivery to the  Beneficiary a cheque for the
balance, if any, of the  total purchase price  for such Exchangeable Shares
without interest but less  any amounts  withheld pursuant to section 5.13.

automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares for shares  of Spinco Common 
Stock and the certificates, if any, held by the Beneficiary  previously 
representing the Exchangeable Shares exchanged by the  Beneficiary with 
Spinco pursuant to such automatic exchange shall thereafter  be deemed to 
represent shares of Spinco Common Stock delivered to  the Beneficiary by 
Newco Canada, pursuant to such automatic exchange.  Upon the request of a 
Beneficiary and the surrender by the Beneficiary of  Exchangeable Share 
certificates, if any, deemed to represent shares of  Spinco Common Stock, 
duly endorsed in blank and accompanied by such instruments  of transfer as 
Newco Canada, may reasonably require, Newco Canada,  shall deliver or cause

**Withholding  Rights**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

Spinco,  Newco Canada, Newco Canada Exchangeco and the Trustee shall be
entitled to  deduct and withhold from any dividend or any consideration
otherwise payable  under this Agreement to any holder of Exchangeable Shares
or shares of Spinco  Common Stock such amounts as Spinco, Newco Canada, Newco
Canada Exchangeco  or  the Trustee is required or permitted to deduct and
withhold with respect  to such  payment under (i) the _Income  Tax Act_
(Canada)  (the " **ITA** "),  the  United States _Internal  Revenue Code
of 1986_ or  any  provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax law,
in each case as  amended or succeeded or (ii) required or permitted in order
to comply with  section 116 of the ITA or any corresponding provisions of
provincial laws.  The Trustee may act on the advice of counsel with respect
to such matters.  To  the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated  for all purposes as having been paid to the holder
of the shares in respect  of  which such deduction and withholding was made,
provided that such withheld  amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate
taxing authority. To the  extent  that the amount so required to be deducted
or withheld from any payment to  a  holder exceeds the cash portion of the
consideration otherwise payable to  the  holder, Spinco, Newco Canada, Newco
Canada Exchangeco and the Trustee are  hereby  authorized to sell or
otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration  as  is necessary to
provide sufficient funds to Spinco, Newco Canada, Newco Canada  Exchangeco or
the Trustee, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with  such 
deduction or withholding requirement and Spinco, Newco Canada, Newco Canada 
Exchangeco or the Trustee shall notify the holder thereof and remit to such 
holder any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale. Each of
Spinco  and Newco Canada represents and warrants that, based upon facts
currently  known  to it, it has no current intention, as at the date of this
Agreement, to  deduct  or withhold from any dividend paid to holders of
Exchangeable Shares any  amounts  under the United States _Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986._

The  Trustee shall not be bound to give notice or do or take any act, action
or  proceeding by virtue of the powers conferred on it hereby unless and
until  it  shall be specifically required to do so under the terms hereof;
nor shall  the  Trustee be required to take any notice of, or to do, or to
take any act,  action  or proceeding as a result of any default or breach of
any provision hereunder,  unless and until notified in writing of such
default or breach, which notices  shall distinctly specify the default or
breach desired to be brought to the  attention of the Trustee, and in the
absence of such notice the Trustee may  for  all purposes of this Agreement
conclusively assume that no default or breach  has  been made in the
observance or performance of any of the representations,  warranties,

       **7.2   **  |  

**No  Conflict of Interest**

The  Trustee represents to Spinco, Newco Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco
that  at  the date of execution and delivery of this Agreement there exists
no material  conflict of interest in the role of the Trustee as a fiduciary
hereunder  and the  role of the Trustee in any other capacity. The Trustee
shall, within 90 days  after it becomes aware that such material conflict of
interest exists, either  eliminate such material conflict of interest or
resign in the manner and  with  the effect specified in Article 10.  If, 
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section 7.2,  the  Trustee
has such a material conflict of interest, the validity and  enforceability of
this Agreement shall not be affected in any manner whatsoever  by reason only
of the existence of such material conflict of interest. If  the  Trustee
contravenes the foregoing provisions of this section 7.2,  any  interested
party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction in Ontario  for  an
order that the Trustee be replaced as Trustee hereunder.

interest  of any Beneficiary in any Exchangeable Shares, including any

such conflicting claims or demands and,  in  so doing, the Trustee shall not
be or become liable to any person on account  of  such election or its
failure or refusal to comply with any such conflicting  claims or demands.

Spinco,  Newco Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco jointly and severally agree
to  indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee and each of its directors,
officers,  employees and agents appointed and acting in accordance with this
Agreement  (collectively, the **" Indemnified  Parties"**)  against  all
claims, losses, damages, reasonable costs, penalties, fines and reasonable 
expenses (including reasonable expenses of the Trustee's legal counsel)
which,  without fraud, negligence, recklessness, wilful misconduct or bad
faith on  the  part of such Indemnified Party, may be paid, incurred or
suffered by the  Indemnified Party by reason or as a result of the Trustee's
acceptance or  administration of the Trust, its compliance with its duties
set forth in  this  Agreement, or any written or oral instruction delivered
to the Trustee by  Spinco, Newco Canada or Newco Canada Exchangeco pursuant
hereto.

 

 

In  no  case shall Spinco, Newco Canada or Newco Canada Exchangeco be liable
under  this  indemnity for any claim against any of the Indemnified Parties
unless Spinco,  Newco Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco shall be notified by
the Trustee  of the  written assertion of a claim or of any action commenced
against the Indemnified  Parties, promptly after any of the Indemnified
Parties shall have received  any  such written assertion of a claim or shall
have been served with a summons  or  other first legal process giving
information as to the nature and basis of  the  claim. Subject to clause
(ii) below, Spinco, Newco Canada and Newco Canada  Exchangeco shall be
entitled to participate at their own expense in the defence  and, if Spinco,
Newco Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco so elect at any  time  after
receipt of such notice, any of them may assume the defence of any suit 
brought to enforce any such claim. The Trustee shall have the right to
employ  separate counsel in any such suit and participate in the defence
thereof,  but  the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense
of the Trustee  unless: (i) the employment of such counsel has been
authorized by Spinco,  Newco Canada or Newco Canada Exchangeco; or (ii) the
named parties to any  such suit include both the Trustee and Spinco, Newco
Canada or Newco Canada  Exchangeco and the Trustee shall have been advised by
counsel acceptable  to  Spinco, Newco Canada or Newco Canada Exchangeco that
there may be one or  more  legal defences available to the Trustee that are
different from or in addition  to those available to Spinco, Newco Canada or
Newco Canada Exchangeco and  that,  in the judgment of such counsel, would
present a conflict of interest were  a  joint representation to be
undertaken (in which case Spinco, Newco Canada  and  Newco Canada Exchangeco
shall not have the right to assume the defence of  such  suit on behalf of
the Trustee but shall be liable to pay the reasonable fees  and  expenses of
counsel for the Trustee). This indemnity shall survive the  termination of
this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the  Trustee.

The  Trustee, or any Trustee hereafter appointed, may at any time resign by
giving  written notice of such resignation to Spinco, Newco Canada and Newco
Canada  Exchangeco specifying the date on which it desires to resign,
provided that  such  notice shall not be given less than sixty (60) days
before such desired  resignation date unless Spinco, Newco Canada and Newco
Canada Exchangeco  otherwise agree and provided further that such resignation
shall not take  effect  until the date of the appointment of a successor
trustee and the acceptance  of  such appointment by the successor trustee.
Upon receiving such notice of  resignation, Spinco, Newco Canada and Newco
Canada Exchangeco shall promptly  appoint a successor trustee, which shall be
a corporation organized and existing  under the laws of Canada and authorized
to carry on the business of a trust  company in all provinces of Canada, by
written instrument in duplicate, one  copy  of which shall be delivered to
the resigning trustee and one copy to the  successor trustee. Failing the
appointment and acceptance of a successor  trustee, a successor trustee may
be appointed by order of a court of competent  jurisdiction upon application
of one or more of the parties to this Agreement.  If the retiring trustee is
the party initiating an application for the  appointment of a successor
trustee by order of a court of competent  jurisdiction, Spinco, Newco Canada

Any  successor trustee appointed as provided under this Agreement shall
execute,  acknowledge and deliver to Spinco, Newco Canada and Newco Canada
Exchangeco  and  to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such

shall become effective  and  such successor trustee, without any further
act, deed or conveyance, shall  become vested with all the rights, powers,
duties and obligations of its  predecessor under this Agreement, with the
like effect as if originally named  as  trustee in this Agreement. However,
on the written request of Spinco, Newco  Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco
or of the successor trustee, the trustee  ceasing to act shall, upon payment
of any amounts then due it pursuant to  the  provisions of this Agreement,
execute and deliver an instrument transferring  to  such successor trustee

SECTION  4.02 _Covenants_. (a)  During  the Restricted Period, Weyerhaeuser
shall not take or fail to take, or permit  its Subsidiaries to take or fail
to take, any action where that action (or  the  failure to take such action)
would (i) violate, be inconsistent with or  cause to be untrue any covenant,
representation or statement made by  Weyerhaeuser or its Subsidiaries in any
letter or certificate that forms  the  basis of any Tax Opinion (including
the Spinco Letter or the Weyerhaeuser  Letter) or any ruling from the IRS
concerning the Contribution and Distribution  (including the Representations)
or (ii) prevent, or be reasonably likely to  prevent, the Tax-Free Status of
the Contribution and the  Distribution. During  the Restricted Period,
Spinco shall not take or fail to take, or permit its  Subsidiaries to take or
fail to take, any action where that action (or the  failure to take such
action) would (x) violate, be inconsistent with or  cause to be untrue any
covenant, representation or statement made by Spinco  after the Distribution
Date or by Domtar in any letter or certificate that  forms  the basis of any
Tax Opinion (including the Domtar Letter) or any ruling  from  the IRS
concerning the Contribution and Distribution (including the  Representations)
or (y) prevent, or be reasonably likely to prevent, the  Tax-Free Status of
the Contribution and the Distribution.

 

 

(b) During  the Restricted Period, the Spinco Group shall not, and shall not
permit its  Affiliates to, in a single transaction or in a series of 
transactions:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

H-13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) enter  into any agreement, understanding, arrangement or substantial
negotiations  as  determined for purposes of Code Section 355(e) and the
Treasury Regulations  thereunder, in connection with which any Person (or, in
the case of an Affiliate  that is a Controlling Shareholder, such Controlling
Shareholder) would (directly  or indirectly) acquire, or have the right to
acquire, from any other Person,  any  interest in Spinco Capital Stock
(except to the extent contemplated under  the  Transaction Documents) (a "
_Proposed  Acquisition Transaction_ ").  For  these purposes, (a) any
recapitalization, repurchase or redemption of Spinco  Capital Stock and any
amendment to the certificate of incorporation (or other  organizational
documents) of Spinco shall be treated as an indirect acquisition  of such
stock by a shareholder to the extent such shareholder's percentage  interest
in the outstanding equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes in  the 
issuer increases by vote or value and (b) if Spinco merges into another
entity  or consolidates with another entity to form a new entity (such other
or new  entity " _Merged  Entity_ "),  Spinco Capital Stock shall refer to
the capital stock of the Merged Entity  and  references in this Agreement to
Spinco shall mean the Merged Entity.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
Proposed Acquisition Transaction shall not  include (w) the adoption by
Spinco of, or an issuance under, a shareholder  rights plan that is described
in or is similar to the shareholder rights  plan  described in

 

IRS  Revenue Ruling 90-11 (for this purpose a shareholder rights plan will
be  considered similar to the plan described in IRS Revenue Ruling 90-11
only  if the  principal purpose for the adoption of the plan providing for
such rights  is to  establish a mechanism by which a publicly held
corporation can, in the future,  provide shareholders with rights to purchase
stock at substantially less  than  fair market value as a means of
responding to unsolicited offers to acquire  the  corporation); (x)
redemptions or repurchases of Spinco Capital Stock pursuant  to  open market
repurchase programs meeting the requirements of Section 4.05(1)(b)  of IRS
Revenue Procedure 96-30;  (y)  issuances of Spinco Capital Stock pursuant to
an employee stock purchase  agreement or equity compensation plan described
in and meeting the requirements  of Safe Harbor VIII (relating to
acquisitions by persons in connection with  the  performance of services) of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.355-7(d), _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that 
prior to adopting, modifying or amending any employee stock purchase
agreement  or equity compensation plan (but not for each issuance of Spinco
Capital  Stock  pursuant thereto) Spinco must first obtain (at its expense)
an Unqualified  Tax  Opinion that any issuance of capital stock of Spinco
treated as equity in  Spinco  for U.S. federal income tax purposes under
such new, modified or amended  agreement or plan would meet the requirements
of Safe Harbor VIII; and (z)  issuances of Spinco Capital Stock described in
and meeting the requirements  of  Safe Harbor IX (relating to the
acquisition by a retirement plan of an employer)  of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.355-7(d);

 

 

(ii) liquidate  Spinco or reclassify Spinco as other than a corporation for
U.S. federal  income  tax purposes; or

 

 

(iii) cause  or  permit Spinco to cease to engage in the Active Trade or
Business; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Spinco Group shall be
permitted to sell or otherwise dispose of Newco  Assets  and Newco Canada
Exchangeco Assets the EBITDA of which represents (taking  into  account all
other sales and dispositions, other than assets sold or transferred  in the
ordinary course of business, by the Spinco Group of the Newco Assets  and 
Newco Canada Exchangeco Assets after the Distribution Date) no more than 
33⅓ percent of the EBITDA of the Newco Assets and Newco Canada Exchangeco
Assets,  _provided_ _further_ ,  that  nothing herein shall prevent the
Spinco Group from selling or disposing of  assets in the ordinary course of
business. For these purposes, EBITDA of  the  Newco Assets and Newco Canada
Exchangeco Assets shall mean the EBITDA generated  by such assets during the
year ending as of the quarter immediately following  the Distribution Date.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in any Transaction Document,
representation letter  or  other document or agreement:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

H-14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) Clauses  (i) through (iii) of paragraph (b) shall not apply to Spinco
upon the prior  written consent of Weyerhaeuser, which consent may not be
withheld if  Weyerhaeuser determines in good faith that Spinco has provided
it with  Satisfactory Guidance concluding that the proposed actions will not
result  in  incremental U.S. federal Transaction Taxes.

 

 

(ii) In  reliance on the representation and warranty provided by Weyerhaeuser
in Section  4.01(a)(iii), Spinco shall be permitted to issue Spinco Capital
Stock beginning  on the day after the one year anniversary of the
Distribution Date, _provided_   that (a)  Spinco must first obtain (at its
expense) an Unqualified Tax Opinion that  is  reasonably acceptable to
Weyerhaeuser (such acceptance to be notified by  Weyerhaeuser to Spinco in
writing within five business days from receipt  by  Weyerhaeuser of such
Unqualified Tax Opinion, it being understood that  Weyerhaeuser shall be
considered to have waived its rights to receive an  Unqualified Tax Opinion
under this Section 4.02(c)(ii) if it fails to indicate  either its acceptance
of, or objection to, the Unqualified Tax Opinion within  such five business
days or fails to reaffirm in writing to the Tax Advisor  preparing such
Unqualified Tax Opinion the representation and warranty provided  by
Weyerhaeuser in Section 4.01(a)(iii) within five business days of request 
therefor) that such issuance would meet the requirements of Safe Harbor III 
of  Treasury Regulation Section 1.355-7(d); (b) such Unqualified Tax
Opinion  is  based on the representation and warranty provided by Domtar in
Section 4.01(b);  and (c) such Unqualified Tax Opinion is based on a
representation and warranty  by Spinco that none of Spinco, its Subsidiaries
or any Controlling Shareholder  of Spinco (including any officers or
directors acting on behalf of Spinco  or any  of its Subsidiaries, or any
Person acting with the implicit or explicit  permission of any such officers,
directors or Controlling Shareholder) has  had  any agreements,
understandings, arrangements or substantial negotiations  as  determined for
purposes of Code Section 355(e) and the Treasury Regulations  thereunder
concerning such issuance or any similar issuance of Spinco Capital  Stock
during the one year period beginning on the Distribution Date. The  sole 
basis for an Unqualified Tax Opinion provided under this Section 4.02(c)(ii) 
not  to be reasonably acceptable to Weyerhaeuser shall be on grounds that
the  letter  or certificate provided by Spinco in connection with such
Unqualified Tax  Opinion was manifestly incorrect as to fact or that the
Unqualified Tax Opinion  was manifestly incorrect as to law. Nothing in this
Section 4.02(c)(ii) shall  be  construed to relieve the Spinco Group of any
liability under Section 2.02  of  this Agreement resulting from such
acquisition or issuance of Spinco Capital  Stock except to the extent that
such liability is attributable to a breach  of  the representation and
warranty provided by Weyerhaeuser in Section  4.01(a)(iii).

 

 

(iii) The  Spinco Group shall be permitted to issue or transfer Spinco
Capital Stock  to any  Person to the extent such issuance or transfer is
required or expressly  permitted under any option, right, privilege or
similar instrument existing  as  of immediately after the Closing Date.

 

 

(iv) The  Spinco Group shall be permitted to take any action (or not take an
action)  required or expressly permitted under any Transaction Document
(other than  this  Agreement) or described in the IRS Ruling.

SECTION  4.03 _  Procedures Regarding Opinion_ _s  and  Rulings_.  (a) 
If the  Spinco Group may take certain actions conditioned upon the receipt
of  Satisfactory Guidance, Weyerhaeuser, at the request of Spinco, shall
use  commercially reasonable efforts to expeditiously obtain, or assist
Spinco  in  obtaining, such Satisfactory Guidance, including affirming to
the relevant  Tax  Advisor or the IRS the representations made by
Weyerhaeuser in this Agreement  and making other representations that are
reasonably requested by Spinco.  Weyerhaeuser shall not be required to take
any action pursuant to this Section  4.03(a) if Spinco fails to certify, upon
request, that all representations  and  warranties made by Spinco after the
Distribution Date in any letter or  certificate forming the basis of any
prior Tax Opinion or ruling from the  IRS,  relating to the Tax-Free Status
of the Contribution and the Distribution,  are  true, correct and complete.
Spinco shall reimburse Weyerhaeuser for all  reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by Weyerhaeuser in  obtaining Satisfactory Guidance.

 

 

(b) Weyerhaeuser  shall have the right to obtain an Unqualified Tax Opinion
at any time in  its  sole discretion. Weyerhaeuser  shall reimburse the
Spinco Group for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and  expenses incurred by
the Spinco Group in obtaining such an Unqualified Tax  Opinion.

 

 

ARTICLE  V

 

_Tax  Contests; Indemnification; Cooperation_

 

 

SECTION  5.01 _Notice_.  Within  10 days after a party (the " _Indemnitee_
")  becomes aware of the existence of a Tax Contest that may give rise to
an  indemnification claim under this Agreement by it against the other
party  (the " _Indemnifying  Party_ "),  the  Indemnitee shall notify the
Indemnifying Party of the Tax Contest, and  thereafter shall promptly forward
or make available to the Indemnifying Party  copies of notices and
communications with a Taxing Authority relating to  such  Tax Contest.

 

 

SECTION  5.02 _Control  of Tax Contests_.  (a)  Except  as otherwise
provided in paragraph (b), Weyerhaeuser may elect to control,  and  to have
sole discretion in handling, settling or contesting, any Tax Contest 
relating to (i) any Tax Returns with respect to the Spinco Group (other than 
Domtar and its Subsidiaries) for any taxable period ending on or before the 
Distribution Date or (ii) the Tax liability arising from the failure of the 
Contribution and Distribution to qualify for Tax-Free Status.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing, Weyerhaeuser shall keep Spinco informed of
material developments  concerning any Tax Contest affecting the Spinco Group,
the Newco Business,  the  Newco Assets or the Newco Canada Exchangeco Assets
and shall not settle or  compromise any Tax Contest in a manner that could
materially adversely affect  the Spinco Group after the Distribution Date
without the prior written consent  of Spinco.

 

 

(b) Spinco  shall control and shall have sole discretion in handling,
settling or contesting  any Tax Contest relating to Transfer Tax Returns.
Weyerhaeuser and Spinco  shall  jointly control Tax Contests relating to (i)
Separate Returns of any member  of the Spinco Group (other than Domtar and
its Subsidiaries) for the Straddle  Period and (ii) Tax liability arising
from the failure of the Contribution  and  Distribution to qualify for Tax-
Free Status, if the Spinco Group potentially  would be liable to Weyerhaeuser
under Article II for Taxes arising in connection  with such Tax Contest.
Neither party shall have the right to settle any such  Tax  Contest without
the consent of the other party.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

H-16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Any  reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in handling, settling or
contesting  a  Tax Contest shall be borne ratably by the parties based on
their ultimate  liability under this Agreement for the Taxes to which the Tax
Contest  relates.

 

 

SECTION  5.03 _Indemnification  Payments_.  If an  Indemnitee has a claim
for an indemnification payment from an Indemnifying  Party  under this
Agreement, the Indemnitee shall promptly provide to the Indemnifying  Party
notice of such claim, including a description of such claim and a detailed 
calculation of the amount of the indemnification payment that is claimed. 
The  Indemnifying Party shall make the claimed payment to the Indemnitee
within  30  days after receiving such notice, unless the Indemnifying Party
reasonably  disputes the amount of, or its liability for, such payment.

 

 

SECTION  5.04 _Payment  of Refunds, Credits and Offsets._   Each  party
shall forward, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to forward, to the  party 
entitled to receive the amount or economic benefit of a refund, credit or 
offset  to Tax the amount of such refund, credit or offset within 10 days
after such  refund is received or after such credit or offset is allowed or
applied against  another Tax liability, as the case may be.

 

 

SECTION  5.05 _Treatment  of Payments_.  The  amount of all
indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be (a)  increased to
take account of any net Tax cost actually incurred by the  Indemnitee arising
from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed  up  for such
increase) and (b) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit  actually
realized by the Indemnitee arising from the incurrence or payment  of  any
such indemnified amount. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost  or
Tax  benefit, the Indemnitee shall be deemed to recognize all other items of
income,  gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising
from  the  receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or
payment of  any  indemnified amount.

 

 

SECTION  5.06 _Expenses_.  Except  as otherwise provided herein, each party
and its Subsidiaries shall bear  their  own expenses incurred in connection
with preparation of Tax Returns, Tax  Contests, and other matters under this
Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  5.07 _Cooperation_.  Each  member of the Weyerhaeuser Group and
the Spinco Group shall cooperate fully  with  all reasonable requests from
the other party in connection with the preparation  and filing of Tax
Returns, Adjustment Requests and Tax Contests concerning  issues or other
matters covered by this Agreement.

 

 

(a) Such  cooperation shall include:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

H-17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) the  retention until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations,  and the  provision upon request, of Tax Returns, books,
records (including information  regarding ownership and Tax basis of
property), documentation and other  information relating to the Tax Returns,
including accompanying  schedules, related workpapers, and documents relating
to rulings or other  determinations by Taxing Authorities;

 

 

(ii) the  execution of any document that may be necessary or reasonably
helpful in  connection with any Tax Contest, the filing of a Tax Return or
Adjustment  Request by a member of the Weyerhaeuser Group or Spinco Group, or
other matters  covered by this Agreement, including certification (provided
in such form  as may  be required by applicable law or reasonably requested
and made to the best  of a  party's knowledge) of the accuracy and
completeness of the information it has  supplied;

 

 

(iii) the  use  of the parties' reasonable best efforts to obtain any
documentation that may be  necessary or reasonably helpful in connection with
any of the foregoing;  and

 

 

(iv) the  use  of the parties' reasonable best efforts to make the
applicable party's current  or former directors, officers, employees, agents
and facilities available  on a  reasonable and mutually convenient basis in
connection with the foregoing  matters.

 

 

(b) If  a  party fails to comply with any of its obligations set forth in
this  Section 5.07  upon  reasonable request and written notice by the
other party, and such failure  results in the imposition of additional Taxes,
the nonperforming party shall  be  liable in full for such additional Taxes.

 

 

SECTION  5.08 _Confidentiality_.  Any  information or documents provided
under this Agreement shall be kept  confidential by the recipient-party,
except as may otherwise be necessary  in  connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or with any Tax Contest. In addition,  if Weyerhaeuser or Spinco
determines that providing such information could  be  commercially
detrimental, violate any law or agreement or waive any privilege,  the
parties shall use reasonable best efforts to permit compliance with the 
obligations under this Agreement in a manner that avoids any such harm or 
consequence.

 

 

SECTION  5.09 _Retention  of Tax Records_.  Spinco  may request from
Weyerhaeuser and retain copies of any Separate Returns for  any  Spinco
Group members, including supporting schedules and workpapers. Neither 
Weyerhaeuser nor Spinco shall, or permit any of their Subsidiaries to,
dispose  of documentation with respect to any Pre-Distribution Period,
including books,  records, Tax Returns and all supporting schedules and
information relating  thereto of any member of the other Group prior to the
expiration of the  applicable statute of limitations. If either Weyerhaeuser
or Spinco intends  to  dispose of documentation relating to Taxes (other
than any such documentation  relating to Domtar or its Subsidiaries) with
respect to any Pre-Distribution  Period, including books, records, Tax
Returns and all supporting schedules  and  information relating thereto
(after the expiration of the applicable statute  of  limitations), of any
member of the other Group, they shall provide written  notice to the other
party describing the documentation to be disposed of  30 days  prior to
taking such action. The other party may arrange to take delivery  of the
documentation described in the notice at its own expense during the 
succeeding 30 day period.

ARTICLE  VI

 

_Resolution  of Disputes_

 

 

SECTION  6.01 _Tax  Disputes_.  The  parties will endeavor, and will cause
their respective Subsidiaries to endeavor,  to resolve in an amicable manner
all disputes arising in connection with  this  Agreement. The parties shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any Tax Dispute  for not less than 45
days. Upon written notice of either party after 45 days,  the matter will be
referred to a Tax Advisor acceptable to both parties.  The Tax  Advisor may,
in its discretion, obtain the services of any third-party necessary  to
assist it in resolving the dispute. The Tax Advisor shall furnish written 
notice to the Companies of its resolution of the dispute as soon as
practicable,  but in any event no later than 45 days after its acceptance of
the matter  for  resolution. Any such resolution by the Tax Advisor will be
binding on the  parties and the parties shall take, or cause to be taken, any
action necessary  to implement the resolution. All fees and expenses of the
Tax Advisor shall  be  shared equally by Weyerhaeuser and Spinco. If, 
having determined that the dispute must be referred to a Tax Advisor, after 
45  days the parties are unable to find a Tax Advisor willing to adjudicate
the  dispute in question and whom the parties in good faith find acceptable,
then  the  dispute will be submitted for arbitration to the American
Arbitration  Association; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  only an
arbitrator that qualifies as a Tax Advisor shall be  selected. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Article  VI_   shall  not apply to any
dispute arising under Section 2.02 with respect to the  respective liability
of the parties in the event Transaction Taxes or Third  Party Transaction
Taxes are imposed.

Notification  of a change of address shall be given by either party to the
other as provided  in this Section 7.01.  All  such notices and
communications shall be effective (i) when received, if  mailed or delivered,
or (ii) when confirmed by fax answerback, if  faxed.

 

 

SECTION  7.02 _Severability_.  If any  provision of this Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or  unenforceable, the remaining provisions
of this Agreement will remain in  full  force, as long as the essential
terms and conditions of this Agreement for  each  party remain valid,
binding and enforceable.

 

 

SECTION  7.03 _Integration;  Amendments_.  Except  as  explicitly stated
herein, this Agreement embodies the entire understanding  between the parties
relating to its subject matter and supersedes and terminates  all prior
agreements and understandings among the parties with respect to  such 
matters. No promises, covenants or representations of any kind, other than 
those  expressly stated herein, have been made to induce any party to enter
into  this  Agreement. This Agreement shall not be modified or terminated
except by a  writing duly signed by each of the parties hereto, and no waiver
of any  provisions of this Agreement shall be effective unless in a writing
duly  signed  by the party sought to be bound. If, and to the extent, the
provisions of  this  Agreement conflict with any of the other Transaction
Documents, the provisions  of this Agreement shall control. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary  in any  other Transaction Document, responsibility
for and indemnification for Taxes  shall be governed exclusively by the
terms, provisions and procedures of  this  Agreement.

SECTION  7.04 _Counterparts._   This  Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall  be  considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one  or  more counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered  to the other
parties.

 

 

SECTION  7.05 _Governing  Law, etc_.  This  Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws  of  the State of Delaware,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern  under  applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof.  Except  to the extent provided in
Section 6.01, any suit, action or proceeding seeking  to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in  connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby will  be  brought
exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America  located in
the State of Delaware, or, if such federal courts do not have  subject 
matter jurisdiction, in the state courts of the State of Delaware. Each of 
the  parties hereto hereby consents to personal jurisdiction in any such
action,  suit  or proceeding brought in any such court (and of the
appropriate appellate  courts  therefrom) and irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable  law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the  venue  of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such  suit,  action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an  inconvenient form. Process
in any such suit, action or proceeding may be  served  on any party anywhere
in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction  of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that  service of process on
such party as provided in Section 7.01 shall be deemed  effective service of
process on such party. Each of the parties hereto hereby  waives any right to
trial by jury with respect to any suit, action or proceeding  seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of  or in 
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated  hereby.

 

 

SECTION  7.06 _Successors  and Assigns_.  Neither  this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations under this  Agreement shall be
assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or  otherwise by any of
the parties without the prior written consent of the  other  party;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  such consent shall be required in the
event of a merger, consolidation or  sale  of either Weyerhaeuser or Spinco.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this  Agreement shall be binding on, and
shall inure to the benefit of, and be  enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and  assigns.

 

 

SECTION  7.07 _Enforcement_.  The  parties acknowledge that irreparable
damage would occur to Weyerhaeuser and  Spinco in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not  performed in accordance with its
specific terms or were otherwise breached.  The  parties agree that
Weyerhaeuser and Spinco shall be entitled to an injunction  or  injunctions
to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to  enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, such remedy being in  addition
to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or in  equity. 
Nothing  in this Agreement (including Article VI)  will  prevent any party
from seeking injunctive relief as it deems necessary or  appropriate.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

H-21  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  7.08 _Survival_.  All  sections of this Agreement shall remain in
effect without limitation as to  time  (except to the extent those Sections
expressly provide for an earlier date,  in  which case as of such date).
