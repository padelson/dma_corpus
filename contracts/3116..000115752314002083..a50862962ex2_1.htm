ARTICLE I

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

Section 1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,

to the obligations of the parties to effect the Merger set forth in this
Agreement, a closing to effectuate the consummation of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the fifth (5th)
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions set
forth in Article VII (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions), at the offices of Kelley Drye and Warren LLP ("Kelley Drye")
located at 101 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10178, or at such other time, date or
place as Purchaser and the Company may agree in writing. The date on which the

(b) to each Advisor (for the avoidance of doubt, including Tailwind), any
Advisor Fees of such Advisor remaining unpaid in accordance with the Closing

(c) to the administrative agent under the Senior Debt, for delivery to the

(d) a deposit in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the

Section 1.6 Computation of Merger Consideration and Per Share Merger

minus the Aggregate Preference Amount by (ii) the sum of (A) the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock required to be cancelled
pursuant to Section 3.3(b)), plus (B) the aggregate number of Participating

3

Purchaser shall have the right to review and comment on the Closing Statement,
and the Company shall give consideration in good faith to any such comments,
but the failure or refusal of the Company to accept any such comments shall
not delay the Closing. The Closing Statement shall be prepared (and the
estimates, determinations and calculations contained therein shall be made) in
accordance with this Agreement, including Section 1.8(e).

  

  

Section 1.8 Working Capital, Actual Cash and Actual Company Transaction
Expenses Adjustments.

  

  

(a) Closing Statement. No later than forty-five (45) days after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall deliver to the Equityholder Representative a statement
(the "Final Closing Statement") setting forth Purchaser's good faith
determination of: (i) the Working Capital as of the opening of business on the
Closing Date (the "Actual Working Capital"), (ii) the aggregate amount of all
Available Cash of the Company and Company Subsidiaries as of the opening of
business on the Closing Date (the "Actual Cash"), (iii) the aggregate amount
of all Company Transaction Expenses as of the opening of business on the
Closing Date (the "Actual Company Transaction Expenses"); (iv) the aggregate
amount of all Funded Indebtedness, including the Senior Debt Payoff Amount, as
of the opening of business on the Closing Date ("Actual Funded Indebtedness")
and (v) based upon such amounts, the Merger Consideration, which statement
shall also set forth in reasonable detail Purchaser's calculation of such
amounts. The Final Closing Statement and the determinations and calculations
contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with this Agreement,
including Section 1.8(e).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Dispute; Dispute Resolution. Within forty-five (45) days after receipt by
the Equityholder Representative of the Final Closing Statement, the
Equityholder Representative shall deliver written notice (a "Dispute Notice")
to Purchaser of any dispute it has with respect to the preparation or content
of the Final Closing Statement, which Dispute Notice shall include a written
description of the basis for and dollar amount of such disputed items (to the
extent reasonably possible), all in reasonable detail. The Actual Working
Capital, Actual Cash, Actual Company Transaction Expenses and Actual Funded
Indebtedness, as set forth in the Final Closing Statement, shall become final,
conclusive and binding on the parties unless the Equityholder Representative
delivers to Purchaser a Dispute Notice within such forty-five (45) day period;
provided, however, that, in the event Purchaser or the Company does not
provide any material papers or documents relating to the calculations
underlying the Final Closing Statement that are reasonably requested by the
Equityholder Representative within five (5) calendar days of request therefor
(or such shorter period as may remain in such forty-five (45) day period),
such forty-five (45) day period shall be extended by one calendar day for each
additional calendar day required for Purchaser or the Company to fully respond
to such request. If the Equityholder Representative notifies Purchaser that it
does not dispute the Final Closing Statement, the Final Closing Statement will
become final, conclusive and binding on the parties at the time such notice is
delivered. If a Dispute Notice is timely delivered within such forty-five (45)
day period (i) any amount set forth in the Final Closing Statement and not
disputed in such Dispute Notice shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties; and (ii) Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative shall
negotiate in good faith during the thirty (30) day period after delivery of
such Dispute Notice to resolve each dispute raised therein (each, an
"Objection"), and if any Objection is resolved, the item so resolved shall be
deemed final, binding and conclusive upon the parties. If Purchaser and the
Equityholder Representative, notwithstanding such good faith efforts, fail to
resolve all of the Objections within such thirty (30) day period (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree), then at the end of such period
Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative shall jointly engage Ernst and
Young LLP (the "Accounting Arbitrator"), to review and resolve exclusively all
of the unresolved Objections (and no other matters contained in the Final
Closing Statement) (acting as an expert and not an arbitrator) in accordance
with this Agreement (including Section 1.8(e)) as soon as practicable
thereafter (but in any event within thirty (30) days after engagement of the
Accounting Arbitrator). Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative shall
cause the Accounting Arbitrator to deliver a written report containing its
calculation of the disputed Objections (which calculation shall be within the
range of dispute between the Final Closing Statement and the Dispute Notice)
within such thirty (30) day period. All Objections that are determined by the
Accounting Arbitrator shall be deemed final, conclusive and binding upon the
parties, absent manifest error, effective as of the date the Accounting
Arbitrator's written determination is received by Purchaser and the
Equityholder Representative and shall be enforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
allocated between, and paid by, Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative
(on behalf of the Equityholders), respectively, in the same proportion as (A)
the difference between the Merger Consideration that would result if each
Objection presented to the Accounting Arbitrator were resolved in favor of the
Equityholder Representative and the Merger Consideration as finally determined
(which shall be the Equityholders' portion) bears to (B) the difference
between the amount of Merger Consideration that would result if each Objection
presented to the Accounting Arbitrator were resolved in favor of Purchaser and
the Merger Consideration as finally determined (which shall be Purchaser's
portion).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Access. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to, make available to the Equityholder Representative, its
accountants and other representatives and the Accounting Arbitrator, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, (i) the books and
records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) the working papers
related to the preparation of the Final Closing Statement (including the
determinations included therein) and (iii) the financial records, accounting
personnel and advisors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, in each
case, in order to facilitate (x) the Equityholder Representative's review of
the Final Closing Statement and (y) the resolution of any Objections with
respect to the Final Closing Statement; provided, that such access shall not
include any access to documents (A) prepared in anticipation of, or for the
purpose of evaluating, any actual or threatened dispute, litigation or
arbitration concerning the Final Closing Statement or (B) that are subject to
attorney-client privilege.

  

  

(d) Payment following Calculation of Final Working Capital, Final Cash, Final
Company Transaction Expenses and Final Funded Indebtedness.

  

  

(i) If the Merger Consideration as finally determined pursuant to Section
1.8(b) exceeds the estimated Merger Consideration set forth in the Closing
Statement, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
to the Equityholders, in accordance with their respective Participation
Percentages, cash in the amount of such difference within five (5) Business
Days after such determination. The portion of such payment to be paid to each
Equityholder with respect to Company Capital Stock shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by such
Equityholder in such Equityholder's Share Letter of Transmittal or, if such
Equityholder desires to have such payment made to an account other than as set
forth in such Equityholder's Share Letter of Transmittal or Option Termination
Agreement, to such account as such Equityholder may designate to Purchaser
reasonably in advance of such payment. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Section 1.8(d) to the contrary, no payment required in this Section 1.8(d)
shall be paid to any Equityholder that is a Dissenting Stockholder with
respect to any Dissenting Shares. The portion of such payment to be paid to
each Equityholder with respect to a Participating Option shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Surviving Corporation (or the
applicable Company Subsidiary) and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving
Corporation (or the applicable Company Subsidiary) to pay such amount to such
Equityholder as promptly as practicable thereafter (subject to Section 3.8).

  

  

(ii) If the Merger Consideration as finally determined pursuant to Section
1.8(b) is less than the estimated Merger Consideration set forth in the
Closing Statement, Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
pay to Purchaser that portion of the Escrow Deposit equal to the amount of
such difference.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Accounting Procedures. The Closing Statement, the Final Closing Statement
and the determinations and calculations contained therein shall be prepared
and calculated on a consolidated basis for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP and using the same accounting principles,
practices, classifications, procedures, policies and methods used and applied
by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in the preparation of the
Financial Statements, except that such statements, calculations and
determinations: (i) shall not include any purchase accounting or other
adjustment arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (ii) shall be based on facts and circumstances as they exist
prior to the Closing and shall exclude the effect of any act, decision or
event occurring on or after the Closing; (iii) shall follow the defined terms
contained in this Agreement whether or not such terms are consistent with
GAAP; and (iv) shall calculate any reserves, accruals or other non-cash
expense items on a pro rata (as opposed to monthly accrual) basis to account
for a Closing that occurs on any date other than the last day of a calendar
month. By way of example, the calculation of Working Capital as of March 31,
2014 and each preceding month-end from and after April 30, 2013 is set forth
in Section 1.8(e) of the Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(f) Treatment of Payments. Any payments made pursuant to this Section 1.8
shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration paid for the Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and for cancellation of the Participating Options, which
adjustment shall be calculated for each share of Company Capital Stock and
each Participating Option as if the dollar amount set forth in Section
1.6(a)(i) had been, at the Effective Time, (i) in the case of payment to
Purchaser, reduced by the amount of such payment, or (ii) in the case of
payment to the Equityholders, increased by the amount of such payment, and the
Per Share Series A Merger Consideration, Per Share Series B Merger
Consideration, Per Share Series C Merger Consideration, the Per Share Common
Merger Consideration and the Option Payments were calculated in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement based upon such adjusted
amount.

  

  

Section 1.9 Escrow Deposits and Escrow Accounts.

  

  

(a) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay Twenty Six Million Four Hundred
Thousand ($26,400,000) (provided, however, such amount shall be Eight Million
Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($8,800,000) if the RandW Insurance Policy is
procured by Purchaser on or before the Closing Date) (the "Escrow Deposit") to
the Escrow Agent, to be held in a separate account (the "Escrow Account")
under an escrow agreement to be entered into as of the Closing Date by
Purchaser, the Equityholder Representative and the Escrow Agent in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Escrow Agreement").
The Escrow Deposit shall be held in the Escrow Account until the eighteen (18)
month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Escrow Period"), subject to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement and Section 6.14(b)(i), to serve as an escrow
fund and partial security for the payment of any indemnifiable Losses payable
to any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to Article IX. At the end of the
Escrow Period, the amount of the Escrow Deposit then held in the Escrow
Account, less any amounts subject to a pending Notice of Claim (as determined
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement), and all interest and income earned
on the Escrow Deposit, shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to the
Equityholders in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement. Purchaser shall pay the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent under
the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the
"NWC Escrow Deposit") to the Escrow Agent, to be held in a separate account
(the "NWC Escrow Account") under the Escrow Agreement. The NWC Escrow Deposit
shall be held in the Escrow Account from the Closing Date until the date upon
which the Final Closing Statement becomes final, conclusive and binding on the
parties pursuant to Section 1.8 or, if earlier, the date upon which all
unresolved Objections are submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator if the
resolution of all such Objections in favor of Purchaser would not result in
any payment to Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.8(d) (the "NWC Escrow Period"),
subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, to serve as an escrow fund and
partial security for the payment of any amount payable to Purchaser pursuant
to Section 1.8(d). At the end of the NWC Escrow Period, the amount of the NWC
Escrow Deposit then held in the Escrow Account, and all interest and income
earned on the NWC Escrow Deposit, less any amounts payable to Purchaser
pursuant to Section 1.8(d)(ii), shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to the
Equityholders in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the NWC Escrow Account shall not be the
sole source of recovery with respect to the amounts payable pursuant to
Section 1.8.

holders, "Dissenting Stockholders" and such shares, "Dissenting Shares") shall
not have such Dissenting Shares converted into the right to receive the
Initial Per Share Merger Consideration applicable to such Dissenting Shares or
the Participation Right, as provided herein, but instead such Dissenting
Shares shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the DGCL. At
the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and extinguished and shall cease to exist,
and except as otherwise provided by Law, each holder of Dissenting Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the rights
granted pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.

  

  

(b) Effect of Loss of Appraisal Right. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 3.5(a), if any Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to validly perfect or
shall otherwise waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such Dissenting Stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262 of the DGCL, then the rights of such Dissenting Stockholder under Section
262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall become: (i) if such
Dissenting Shares are shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the right to receive
the Per Share Series A Merger Consideration as and to the extent provided
herein, (ii) if such Dissenting Shares are shares of Series B Preferred Stock,
the right to receive the Per Share Series B Merger Consideration as and to the
extent provided herein, (iii) if such Dissenting Shares are shares of Series C
Preferred Stock, the right to receive the Per Share Series C Merger
Consideration as and to the extent provided herein, and (iv) if such
Dissenting Shares are shares of Common Stock, the right to receive the Per
Share Common Merger Consideration as and to the extent provided herein. Any
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid
by Purchaser, in cash, as follows:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(A) to such Dissenting Stockholder with respect to each Dissenting Share of
such Dissenting Stockholder, upon delivery by such Dissenting Stockholder to
the Surviving Corporation of the Certificate representing such Dissenting
Share (or such other documents as may be specified in Section 3.7(d), if
applicable) and a duly executed Share Letter of Transmittal, an amount equal
to the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to such Dissenting
Share (or, if the Final Cash, Final Working Capital, Final Company Transaction
Expenses and Final Indebtedness have been determined at the time of such
payment, such amount as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.8); and

  

  

(B) to the Equityholder Representative, concurrently with the payment to such
Dissenting Stockholder, for disbursement pursuant to the Agreement Among
Holders, an amount per share equal to the amount provided in clause (b) of the
definition of Initial Per Share Common Merger Consideration.

  

  

(c) Conduct of Appraisal Proceedings. The Company shall give Purchaser prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal pursuant to the applicable provisions of
the DGCL received by the Company prior to the Effective Time, withdrawals of
such demands received by the Company prior to the Effective Time, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
prior to the Effective Time with respect thereto. Purchaser shall have the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle any such
demands.

  

  

Section 3.6 No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock. At and after the
Effective Time, holders of shares of Company Capital Stock shall cease to have
any rights as stockholders of the Company, except for the right to receive the
Per Share Series A Merger Consideration, Per Share Series B Merger
Consideration, Per Share Series C Merger Consideration and Per Share Common
Merger Consideration applicable to such shares of Company Capital Stock, in
each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and no transfer of shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter be made. If, after
the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Capital Stock are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the Per Share Series A Merger Consideration, Per Share Series B Merger
Consideration, Per Share Series C Merger Consideration or Per Share Common
Merger Consideration applicable to such shares of Company Capital Stock, in
each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Purchaser and Acquisition Subsidiary jointly and severally represent and
warrant to the Company that the following statements are true and correct as
of the date of this Agreement and will be true and correct as of the Closing:

owned, licensed, leased or otherwise held by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure

contemplated hereby.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36

approved and declared advisable by the boards of directors of Purchaser and
Acquisition Subsidiary and approved by Purchaser, as the sole stockholder of
Acquisition Subsidiary, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Purchaser or Acquisition Subsidiary are necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation by Purchaser
and Acquisition Subsidiary of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by each of Purchaser and Acquisition Subsidiary and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by each other

acceleration under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
material assets or properties of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
(including Acquisition Subsidiary) under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any written or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, oral Contract to
which Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including Acquisition Subsidiary)

of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser or Acquisition
Subsidiary or the consummation by Purchaser and Acquisition Subsidiary of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, other than such
declarations, filings, registrations, notices, authorizations, consents,
Orders or approvals as, if not made or obtained, as the case may be, would not
reasonably be expected to impair the validity of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

binding and enforceable obligations of Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of

of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser is not in material breach of any of
the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter and, to the Knowledge of

Contracts, understandings or agreements to which Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates is a party that impose conditions to the funding of the Financing,

thereto will be unable to satisfy or does not intend to satisfy, on a timely
basis, any of the conditions to the Financing to be satisfied pursuant to the

its Affiliates to not, enter into any agreement to acquire, or acquire,
directly or indirectly: any business or assets competitive with the Company's

approval obtained in connection therewith.

  

  

Section 6.4 Written Consent of Company Stockholders. The Company shall use its
best efforts to obtain, as soon as practicable, and in any event no later than

seven percent (97%) of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock

signing such consent that (A) the approval given thereby is irrevocable and
that such stockholder is aware of its rights to demand appraisal for its
shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and that such stockholder has
received and read a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL, and (B) because of its
approval of the Merger it is not entitled to appraisal rights with respect to
its shares in connection with the Merger and thereby waives any rights to
receive payment of the fair value of its Company Capital Stock under the DGCL.

other than the Company Stockholder Approval is necessary by the holders of any
Company Capital Stock to adopt this Agreement or approve the Merger.

Board shall recommend that the holders of Company Capital Stock vote to adopt
this Agreement and approve the Merger and shall use its best efforts to

announcement with respect to the existence of or subject matter of this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company (with prior
approval of the Company Board); and (b) neither the Company nor the
Equityholder Representative shall make or permit any public announcement with
respect to the existence of or subject matter of this Agreement without the

agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, the disclosing party shall
provide reasonable advance written notice thereof to the non-disclosing
parties and consult with the non-disclosing parties concerning the contents of
the public announcement. The initial press release with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall require the
prior written approval of the Company (with prior approval of the Company
Board) and Purchaser, if made prior to the Closing, or the Equityholder
Representative and Purchaser, if made after the Closing, and any subsequent
press releases, similar announcements or other public statements with respect
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other
than those containing only the information concerning this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby contained in the so approved initial press
release, shall be made prior to the Closing only upon the prior written

the business of the Surviving Corporation, the Company Subsidiaries or
Purchaser.

exculpation and related rights to advancement of expenses on the part of each
person who at the Effective Time is a current or former director, officer or
limited liability company manager of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Indemnified Directors or Officers"), including all such
rights existing pursuant to the DGCL, the Organizational Documents of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, or any written agreement between any
Indemnified Director or Officer and the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in
effect on the date of this Agreement and set forth on Section 6.9 of the

out of such Indemnified Director or Officer's service, prior to the Effective
Time, as directors, officers or managers of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable, or as trustees, fiduciaries or administrators of
any plan for the benefit of employees of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries (each, a "Covered Proceeding"); provided that if any Covered
Proceeding is commenced within such time period, all rights to indemnification
in respect of such Covered Proceeding shall continue until final disposition
of such Covered Proceeding. In the event that any Indemnified Director or
Officer is named in or otherwise becomes involved in a Covered Proceeding,
Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Subsidiaries to), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, pay,
as incurred, within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of such

time, such Indemnified Director or Officer's reasonable, out-of-pocket and
documented fees and other expenses of counsel selected by such Indemnified
Director or Officer incurred in connection therewith, including the cost of
any investigation, preparation and settlement; provided, however, that such
payments need not be made unless Purchaser shall have received an undertaking
from such Indemnified Director or Officer to repay in full such amount to
Purchaser (or the Surviving Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries) if it is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, in a final order or decree
not subject to further appeal, that none of Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries is legally permitted to indemnify such
Indemnified Director or Officer under applicable Law and provided, further,
that none of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries,
in connection with any one such Covered Proceeding or separate but
substantially similar Covered Proceedings arising out of the same general
allegations, shall be liable for reasonable fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for
all indemnified persons except to the extent that an Indemnified Director or
Officer has been advised by counsel that there are conflicting interests
between it and any other Indemnified Director or Officer(s). Purchaser shall
pay all reasonable fees and expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel,
that may be incurred by any Indemnified Director or Officer in enforcing the

shall, purchase a six (6) year "tail" coverage covering acts or omissions of
the Indemnified Directors or Officers prior to the Effective Time on terms no

described in this Section 6.9(b) to the directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy or policies maintained by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries at the date of this Agreement (including coverage amounts and
limitations). The cost of such "tail" coverage shall be deemed to be a Company
Transaction Expense.

  

  

(c) The covenants set forth in this Section 6.9 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Directors or
Officers and their respective heirs, beneficiaries, legatees and legal
representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Director or Officer is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

  

  

(d) If, after the Closing, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or assigns shall: (i) merge
or consolidate with or merge into any other Person, or otherwise engage in any
business combination with any other Person, and shall not be the surviving or
continuing Person of such consolidation, merger or business combination; or
(ii) transfer all or substantially all of their respective assets and
properties to any Person, then in each such case, Purchaser shall take all
actions reasonably necessary to ensure that the successors or assigns of
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries (as

Effective Time, subject to Section 6.10(e) Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and the Company

49

Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries)
to provide each Employee who remains employed by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries)
following the Effective Time with employee benefits (but excluding any equity

benefits or non-qualified deferred compensation plan benefits) that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to either (i) the employee benefits,
including severance, provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
such Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Plans
or (ii) the employee benefits , including severance, contemporaneously
provided by Purchaser or its Affiliates to an employee of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates in a position comparable to such Employee.

or will participate (each, a "Recipient Plan") to: (i) waive all pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such Employee under such Recipient Plans,
except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting
periods under the analogous Company Plan are applicable to such Employee prior
to the Effective Time; (ii) provide such Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent
such credit was given under the analogous Company Plan applicable to such
Employee prior to the Effective Time) for the plan year of the Recipient Plan
that includes the Closing Date; and (iii) recognize all service of such
Employee (to the same extent such service was recognized under the analogous
Company Plan applicable to such Employee prior to the Effective Time) for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and, with respect to vacation,
short term disability or severance plan only, benefit accrual in such
Recipient Plan; provided, however, that: (x) the foregoing shall not apply to
the extent it would result in duplication of benefits; (y) the foregoing shall
be subject to any term or condition of any Recipient Plan imposed by a third
party insurer or plan administrator to the extent such term or condition is
not waived after Purchaser uses reasonable best efforts to acquire such waiver
and (z) compliance with the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall be (A)
subject to Purchaser's use of commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
compliance and (B) required only to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, officer,
director or consultant, or any other individual associated therewith, shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.10;
provided, however, that in the event of a material breach of Purchaser's
obligations under this Section 6.10, which breach affects the Employees
generally (as opposed to being specific to a particular Employee), the
Equityholder Representative shall, in its discretion, be entitled to enforce
this provision on behalf of such Persons and be entitled, on behalf of such
Persons, to recoup any Losses to which such Persons would be entitled if they
had a direct right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.10. In no event
shall Section 6.10 or the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish,
amend or modify any Company Plan or any other "employee benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by the Company, Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or
limit the ability of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to amend,
modify or terminate any Company Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time; or (iii) confer
upon any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant, any
right to employment or continued employment or continued service with
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries), or constitute or create an employment agreement with any
employee.

  

  

Section 6.11 Notification of Breaches.

  

  

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, (i) Purchaser shall notify the Company
(with reasonable detail) as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming
aware of any material breach, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event,
the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which could reasonably be expected to
result in a breach, of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or of any fact or condition that would
cause or reasonably be expected to cause a condition to the Company's
obligation to consummate the Closing set forth in Article VII to not be
satisfied, and (ii) the Company shall notify Purchaser (with reasonable
detail) as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of any material
breach, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event, the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of which could reasonably be expected to result in a breach, of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement or of any fact or condition that would cause or reasonably be
expected to cause a condition to Purchaser's obligation to consummate the
Closing set forth in Article VII to not be satisfied. Except as provided in
Section 6.11(b), such notice shall not be deemed to supplement or amend the
Disclosure Schedule or any representation and warranty or covenant and
agreement of the Company or Purchaser for the purpose of (A) determining
whether any of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied,
(B) affect any party's right to indemnification pursuant to Article IX or (C)
determining whether any breach or inaccuracy of representation or warranty or
breach of covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement has occurred.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.11(a): (i) if the Company
delivers a notice pursuant to Section 6.11(a) with respect to breaches of
representations and warranties of the Company or Purchaser delivers a notice
pursuant to Section 6.11(a) with respect to breaches of representations and
warranties of Purchaser and Acquisition Subsidiary, in either case (A)
resulting from events occurring after the date of this Agreement and (B) which
breaches are material enough to permit the non-breaching party to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, and nonetheless the non-breaching
party proceeds with the Closing, then from and after the Closing the non-
breaching party shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights it (and, in
the case of Purchaser, all other Purchaser Indemnified Parties, and in the
case of the Company, all of the Company Indemnified Parties) may have arising
from or relating to the breach of the representations and warranties resulting
from events occurring after the date of this Agreement to the extent described
in such notice (including the right to indemnification pursuant to Article
IX); provided, however, no such waiver shall apply if and to the extent the
breach described in such notice related to the failure of a representation or
warranty of the party who delivered such notice (or, in the case of Purchaser,
Acquisition Subsidiary) to be true and correct on and as of the date of this
Agreement; and (ii) if the Company delivers a notice pursuant to Section
6.11(a) with respect to breaches of representations and warranties set forth
in the first sentence of Section 4.10 (Permits) (except with respect to
revoked Company Permits or Permits for which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries are required to possess but do not possess), the last sentence of
Section 4.14(a) (Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA), the first sentence of Section
4.15 (Employees; Labor Proceedings), Section 4.20(a) (Material Contracts) or
the first sentence of Section 4.21 (Insurance), from and after the Closing
Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights it and all other
Purchaser Indemnified Parties may have arising from or relating to a breach of
representation or warranty with respect to such section that is described in
such notice (including any right to indemnification pursuant to Article IX);
provided, however, no such waiver shall apply if and to the extent the breach
described in such notice related to the failure of a representation or
warranty of the Company be true and correct on and as of the date of this
Agreement or resulted from a breach by the Company of any of its covenants and
agreements in this Agreement; and (iii) if the Company delivers a notice
pursuant to Section 6.11(a) with respect to breaches of representations and
warranties of the Company resulting from events occurring after the date of
which all conditions to the Closing under Article VII have been satisfied
(other than conditions which by their nature are to be performed at the
Closing) except for the completion of the Marketing Period, then from and
after the Closing Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights
it and all other Purchaser Indemnified Parties may have arising from or
relating to such breach of the representations and warranties to the extent
described in such notice (including the right to indemnification pursuant to
Article IX); provided, however, no such waiver shall apply if and to the
extent the breach described in such notice related to the failure of a
representation or warranty of the Company to be true and correct on and as of
the date of this Agreement or on and as of the date on which all such other
conditions under Article VII were satisfied or resulted from a breach by the
Company of any of its covenants and agreements in this Agreement.

Section 6.12 Financing.

  

  

(a) Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange the Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter. In the event any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with terms and
conditions not materially less favorable (taken as a whole) to Purchaser than
the terms and conditions (taken as a whole) set forth in the Commitment Letter
("Alternative Committed Financing"), including from alternative sources,
following the occurrence of such event. Purchaser shall give the Company
prompt written notice upon becoming aware of (i) any breach by any party of
the Commitment Letter, (ii) any expiration or termination of the Commitment
Letter or any Financing Document or (iii) any material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to the Commitment Letter (excluding ordinary
course negotiations with respect to terms of the Financing). Purchaser shall
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing or the Alternative
Committed Financing, as the case may be, and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
any Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver would
reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the ability of Purchaser
to receive the full amount of the Financing or the Alternative Committed
Financing, as the case may be, at or before the date on which the Closing is
to occur pursuant to Section 1.4 or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Purchaser shall provide written notice to the Company
promptly upon receiving the Financing or the Alternative Committed Financing,
as the case may be, and shall provide copies of executed counterparts of any
Financing Documents that fall within the definition of "Commitment Letter"
promptly as they become available (provided that any fee letters, engagement
letters or other agreements that, in accordance with customary practice, are
confidential by their terms may be redacted so as not to disclose such terms
that are confidential).

  

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts,
and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best
efforts to provide and or cause its and the Company Representatives to provide
to Purchaser, at Purchaser's sole expense, all cooperation reasonably
requested by Purchaser that is customary in connection with the arrangement of
the type of Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter (provided in all
cases that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries). Without
limiting the foregoing sentence, the Company shall, shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each of the Company Representatives to (i) (A) furnish Purchaser and its
Financing Sources, as promptly as reasonably practicable following Purchaser's
request, with such pertinent and customary information, to the extent
reasonably available to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, regarding the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and any supplements thereto, as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser to consummate the Financing and (B) furnish
Purchaser and its Financing Sources, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following Purchaser's request, with information regarding the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (including information to be used in the preparation of
one or more information packages regarding the business, operations, financial
projections and prospects of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries)
reasonable and customary for the arrangement of loans contemplated by the
Financing, to the extent reasonably available to the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives and to assist in preparation of
customary rating agency or lender presentations relating to such arrangement
of loans, (ii) furnish all consolidated financial statements, business and
other financial data (other than pro forma financial statements but including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any financial information of the Company and the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Company Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to permit the Purchaser to prepare
pro forma financial statements required under the Commitment Letter, and
excluding textual descriptions of the Company's business and financial results
(other than what is customarily contained in the notes to the Company's
financial statements)), and audit reports of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, and any supplements thereto required under the Commitment Letter
and written financial information reasonably necessary for Purchaser and the
Financing Sources to prepare the "Confidential Information Memorandum"
referred to in the Commitment Letter (the information referred to in clauses
(i) and (ii) being referred to in this Agreement as the "Required
Information"), (iii) participate and have one or more members of senior
management and the Company Representatives participate in a reasonable number
of meetings, presentations, confidential information memorandum presentations
and meetings, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with
rating agencies in connection with the Financing (including customary one-on-
one meetings with the Financing Sources), (iv) assist reasonably with the
preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, bank information
memoranda, and similar documents required in connection with the Financing;
provided that any rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, and
similar documents required in connection with the Financing shall contain
disclosure reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or the Company
Subsidiaries as the obligor, (v) take all corporate actions, subject to and
only effective upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested
by Purchaser to permit the consummation of the Financing and to permit the
proceeds thereof to be made available to the Surviving Corporation immediately
after the Effective Time, (vi) execute and deliver any customary pledge and
security documents, credit agreements, ancillary loan documents and customary
closing certificates and documents (in each case, subject to and only
effective upon occurrence of the Effective Time) and assist in preparing
schedules thereto as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser (including
delivery of borrowing base certificates and delivery of a solvency certificate
of the chief financial officer of the Company, (vii) assist in (A) the
preparation, execution and delivery of one or more credit agreements,
indentures, currency or interest hedging agreements or (B) the amendment or
modification of any of the Company's or the Company Subsidiaries' currency or
interest hedging agreements, if any, in each case, on terms that are
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the Financing; provided
that no obligation of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under any
such agreements or amendments shall be effective until the Effective Time,
(viii) in connection with the Financing, provide customary authorization
letters to the Financing Sources for the Financing authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders and containing a customary
representation to the Financing Sources for the Financing that such
information does not contain a material misstatement or omission and
containing a representation to the Financing Sources that the public-side
versions of such documents, if any, consist exclusively of information with
respect to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and/or their respective
securities that is either (A) publicly available or (B) not material with
respect to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

respective securities for purposes of United States Federal and state
securities laws, (ix) use reasonable best efforts to arrange for customary

Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date all documentation and other

credit facilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries being offered or
arranged between the execution of this Agreement and the Effective Time.
Purchaser shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without
limitation reasonable attorneys' and accountants costs and expenses) incurred
by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the
cooperation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries contemplated by this
Section 6.12(b) and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives from and against any and all
direct and actual losses (other than lost profits), damages, claims, costs or
expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing, any action taken by them at the request of
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.12(b) and any information used in
connection therewith (except with respect to any information provided in
writing by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries specifically for use
in connection therewith), except, in each case, insofar as such losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses (i) arose out of or resulted from the
common law fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives, (ii) directly resulted
from the breach of any of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement
or (iii) that were agreed to in a settlement without the written consent of
Purchaser.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.12,
(i) no obligation of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under any
agreement, certificate, document or instrument (other than the authorization
letters referred to above) shall be effective until the Effective Time (and

Section 6.13 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that (i) the taxable year of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall end for federal Income Tax purposes
on the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A), (ii) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall
join the Purchaser Group as of the end of the day on the Closing Date pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A), and (iii) if any of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries is permitted, but not required, under any
applicable Tax Law, to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable
period, each party, as applicable, shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
treat the Closing Date as the last day of that taxable period. In each case
where applicable Tax Law requires or permits the taxable year of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to end on the Closing Date, the taxable income,
gain, loss, deduction and credit of each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall be apportioned between its taxable year ending on the
Closing Date and its taxable year beginning on the day after the Closing Date
based on a closing of the books of the Company or of such Company Subsidiary
as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and no election shall be made
to prorate items pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D), provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated on an annual basis (such as deductions for depreciation)
shall be allocated between the short taxable year ending on the Closing Date
and the short taxable year beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each such short year. In any case where applicable Tax
Law does not permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to close its taxable
year as of the end of the Closing Date or assesses a Tax with respect to a
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period"), Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period shall be
allocated as follows:

  

  

(A) Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts, and sales and payroll
Taxes, shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date based on an interim closing of the books of the Company or the
Company Subsidiary, as applicable, provided that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (such as deductions for
depreciation) shall be allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each such
period.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(B) All other Taxes shall be allocated between the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each
such period.

  

  

Each party hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, file all Tax
Returns so as to effect the provisions of this Section 6.13(a).

  

  

(b) The Equityholders, and not Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing Date, the Surviving Company and the Company Subsidiaries), shall
be responsible for the payment of, or the non-payment of, and shall timely pay
in accordance with Section 6.13(c), all Income Taxes of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion ending on
the Closing Date of any Straddle Period, but excluding any Income Taxes
resulting from or relating to (i) an election, if any, made by Purchaser or
its Affiliates under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any transaction occurring on the Closing
Date but after Closing outside the ordinary course of business and not
contemplated by this Agreement, including any such transaction treated under
the Next Day Rule as occurring on the day after the Closing Date, and (iii)
any breach by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of Section 6.13(d)(i), (ii)
or (iii). Income Taxes payable for any Straddle Period shall be allocated
between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing
Date (for which the Equityholders are responsible) and the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date (for which the
Equityholders are not responsible) in accordance with the provisions of
Section 6.13(a).

  

  

(c) Purchaser or the Surviving Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and timely file or cause to be timely filed with the appropriate federal,
state, local and foreign Governmental Authorities all Tax Returns of or with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
operations for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are filed after the Closing
Date and for all Straddle Periods. Each such Tax Return shall be completed in
substantial compliance with applicable Law and consistent with past practice
in all material respects, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. No
later than forty-five (45) days prior to filing any such Tax Return that is an
Income Tax Return, Purchaser shall submit such Income Tax Return, together
with a calculation of the portion of Taxes shown on such Income Tax Return for
which the Equityholders are responsible pursuant to Section 6.13(b), to the
Equityholder Representative for its review and consent. If the Equityholder
Representative fails within fifteen (15) days of receipt of any such Income
Tax Return and calculation to notify Purchaser of any objection with respect
thereto, then the Equityholder Representative shall be deemed to consent to
such Income Tax Return and calculation. If the Equityholder Representative
objects to any portion of any such Income Tax Return or calculation, the
Equityholder Representative shall provide written notice of such objection to
Purchaser no later than fifteen (15) days following the delivery by Purchaser
to the Equityholder Representative of the Income Tax Return and calculation,
setting forth in reasonable detail those items to which the Equityholder
Representative objects, the adjustments proposed by the Equityholder
Representative, and the basis for the Equityholder Representative's suggested
adjustments. The parties shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute
prior to the date on which the relevant Income Tax Return is required to be
filed. If the parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in question
shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm using dispute resolution procedures
equivalent to those set forth in Section 1.8(b). Purchaser shall be reimbursed
for any Income Taxes that are required to be paid pursuant to such Income Tax
Returns for which the Equityholders are responsible pursuant to Section
6.13(b), to the extent such Income Taxes have not been paid on or prior to the
Closing Date, from the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or permit any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Surviving Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) to (i) make an election under Section 338 of the Code (or any
analogous or similar provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law)
with respect to any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) amend any
Income Tax Returns of the Company or of any of the Company Subsidiaries filed
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period, or (iii)
make any Income Tax election that affects the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any
Straddle Period (to the extent such election affects the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date), in each case without the prior
written consent of the Equityholder Representative (not to be unreasonably
withheld).

  

  

(e) The Equityholders shall be entitled to any Tax refunds (including interest
received thereon) received by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, and to any
amounts credited against Income Tax to which Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates becomes entitled, that relate to any Income Taxes of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion ending
on the Closing Date of any Straddle Period for which the Equityholders are
responsible pursuant to Section 6.13(b); provided that to the extent any such
Tax refund or amount credited against Income Tax would not have been received
or available in the absence of the Transaction Tax Deductions, Purchaser or
its Affiliates shall be entitled to retain such refund or credit and shall not
be required to pay such amount to the Equityholder Representative. Purchaser
shall pay the amount of any such refund or credit (net of any Income Taxes
imposed upon Purchaser or its Affiliates with respect to its receipt of such
refund or credit) to the Equityholder Representative within fifteen (15) days
after it is received or applied against any Tax liability.

  

  

(f) To the extent that any Company Plan or compensatory arrangement binding
upon the Company or any Company Subsidiary provides for payments to be paid to
any employee thereof that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the
Code, then prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to take such action as would be necessary to seek shareholder approval
of such payments that if obtained, would qualify as "shareholder approval"
within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and QandA-7 of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1.

  

  

(g) The Equityholders and Purchaser shall each be responsible for and pay one-
half of all Transfer Taxes.

  

  

(h) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.13 and to Article IX,
Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested, in connection with (i) the preparation and
filing of Tax Returns, (ii) any audit or other Proceeding with respect to
Taxes and Tax Returns and (iii) the preparation of any financial statements to
the extent related to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention, and
(upon the other party's request) the provision, of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such audit or other Proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder; provided, that
the party requesting assistance shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the party providing such assistance; provided, further,
no party shall be required to provide assistance at times or in amounts that
would interfere unreasonably with the business and operations of such party.

Section 6.14 RandW Insurance Policy.

  

  

(a) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to acquire, at or
prior to the Closing, a transaction representations and warranties insurance
policy on terms and conditions substantially similar to those set forth in the
Non-Binding Indication Letter dated April 29, 2014 addressed to Purchaser and
previously provided to the Company (the "NBIL") and the sample policy provided
to the Company on May 8, 2014, with only such additions, deletions and other
changes to such terms and conditions and such policy that are adverse to the
Equityholders or the Equityholder Representative or that increase the premium
of the policy as Purchaser and the Company (prior to the Effective Time) or
the Equityholder Representative (after the Effective Time) may mutually agree
(such insurance policy, the "RandW Insurance Policy"). The RandW Insurance Policy
shall: (i) contain a waiver of subrogation by the insurer in favor of the
Equityholders, with only an exception for fraud, (ii) contain declarations in
accordance with the comparable provisions of the NBIL and (iii) not have any
partial cover, no cover or other coverage qualifications on the cover page
thereof (except for exclusions set forth in such policy), in any such case set
forth in the preceding clause (i), (ii) or (iii) unless mutually agreed by
Purchaser and the Company (prior to the Effective Time) or the Equityholder
Representative (after the Effective Time). The Company shall be responsible
for one half (1/2) of the premium for the RandW Insurance Policy, which amount
shall be characterized as a Company Transaction Expense for purposes of this
Agreement, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the remainder of the premium
and for all other costs of procuring the RandW Insurance Policy. Each of the
Company and Purchaser shall undertake its commercially reasonable efforts as
may be necessary or appropriate to enable Purchaser to procure the RandW
Insurance Policy at or prior to the Closing. From and after the issuance of
the RandW Insurance Policy, Purchaser shall not amend, modify or otherwise
change, terminate or waive any provision of the RandW Insurance Policy in a
manner adverse to the Equityholders (in light of the purpose of the RandW
Insurance Policy reflected in Article IX) or the Equityholder Representative
including with respect to the waiver of subrogation set forth therein, without
the prior written consent of the Equityholder Representative.

  

  

(b) If a RandW Insurance Policy is obtained, then from and after the date such
RandW Insurance Policy becomes effective: (i) the Escrow Period shall be reduced
to the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement, (ii) the
provisions of Section 9.6 shall not apply to the RandW Insurance Policy and
(iii) notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.12(a), any valid
indemnification claims brought by any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties

(b) By either the Company (with prior approval of the Company Board) or
Purchaser if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the day that is
one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of this Agreement (or such other
date to which the Company (with prior approval of the Company Board) and
Purchaser may agree) (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be
available to the Company or Purchaser if its breach (or in the case of
Purchaser, Acquisition Subsidiary's breach) of any provision of this Agreement
shall have caused, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before the Termination Date; provided, further, however, that if the failure
for the Closing not having occurred by the Termination Date is due solely to a
delay in satisfying the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(d) and Section
7.2(d), the date referred to in this Section 8.1(b) as the "Termination Date"
shall be the day that is two hundred ten (210) days after the date of this

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) By either the Company (with prior approval of the Company Board) or
Purchaser if any Law (including any Order) which prohibits or makes the
consummation of the Merger illegal shall be enacted, entered or promulgated by
any Governmental Authority and shall have become final and non-appealable;
provided, however, the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(c) shall not be available to the Company or Purchaser unless such party
shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under

(ii) if the Marketing Period has been completed and the conditions to closing

satisfied) and Purchaser is unable to satisfy its obligation to effect the
Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
Section 1.4 because of a Financing Failure; provided, that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(ii) if the Company is

Termination Date; provided, that Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)(i) if Purchaser is in material breach of this
Agreement; or

  

  

(ii) if the Required Written Consents are not delivered to Purchaser within
twenty-four (24) hours of the execution of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the

effect, without any liability to any party, any Affiliates of such party or
any of the directors, officers, managers, partners, employees, equityholders,
representatives or agents of such party or its Affiliates in respect hereof,
except that:

  

  

(i) any such termination shall not affect the parties' respective rights and
obligations under Section 6.6 (regarding public announcements), this Section
8.2, Section 8.3, Article XII or the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which
shall survive such termination; and

  

  

(ii) if such termination results from the: (A) willful and material breach by
a party of a covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement; or (B) willful
and material breach by a party of any of its representations and warranties
set forth in this Agreement, such party shall be fully liable for any and all
Losses incurred or suffered by the other parties as a result of such failure
or breach;

  

  

provided, however, that no party shall have any liability arising from any
failure or breach referred to in the preceding clause (ii) unless such party
shall have received written notice of a claim therefor from another party
within thirty (30) days after the termination of this Agreement describing in
reasonable detail the failure or breach and the Losses resulting therefrom, to
the extent known and, thereafter, such liability shall have been either agreed
upon in writing by the parties or determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction. For purposes of this Article VIII, the Losses of the Company
resulting from a failure or breach by Purchaser or Acquisition Subsidiary
referred to in the preceding clause (ii) shall be deemed to include any Losses
incurred by the Equityholders in connection with the failure of Purchaser and
Acquisition Subsidiary to consummate the Closing.

  

  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated as provided in this Section 8.2: (i)
Purchaser and Acquisition Subsidiary shall take the actions set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement with respect to all documents and other materials
received from the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, any of their respective
Affiliates, any of the Company Representatives or any of the directors,

Affiliate (including all copies of or materials developed from any such
documents or other materials) relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether obtained before or after the execution hereof; and (ii) all
confidential information received by Purchaser, Acquisition Subsidiary or the
Purchaser Representatives with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates shall be treated in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.3 Purchaser Termination Fee.

  

  

(a) In the event that this Agreement has been terminated (i) by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 8.1(b), if at the time of such termination by Purchaser
the Company would have been able, upon notice to Purchaser, to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii), or (ii) by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(ii), then within two (2) Business Days following such
termination Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company an
aggregate amount equal to Twenty Two Million Dollars ($22,000,000) (the
"Purchaser Termination Fee"). The parties understand and agree that in no
event shall Purchaser be required to pay the Purchaser Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the
case of intentional fraud or a willful and material breach of this Agreement,
if Purchaser fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required
to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.4 or fail to perform hereunder as a
result of a Financing Failure, then the Company's and its Affiliates' sole and
exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against Purchaser, their Affiliates, the Financing Sources and the
Purchaser Representatives and assignees for any breach, loss or damage shall
be to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the Purchaser
Termination Fee only to the extent provided by Section 8.3(a), and none of
Purchaser, its Affiliates, the Financing Sources or the Purchaser
Representatives or assignees will have any liability or obligation to the
Company or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith
or therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. The
Financing Sources (and such Financing Source's Affiliates, equityholders,
members, partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and
Representatives) are express third party beneficiaries of this Section 8.3(b).

the Fundamental Purchaser Representations shall survive for a period of four
(4) years after the Closing Date and (ii) the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 4.13 (Taxes) shall survive until the applicable statute

Closing shall survive the Closing until the twelve (12) month anniversary of
the date of the Closing and shall thereupon expire and (ii) of the other
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
without limitation as to time; provided, that if a covenant or agreement
referred to in this clause (ii) specifies a term, in such case the performance
obligations under such covenant or agreement shall survive for such specified
term and shall thereupon expire, but the right of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties and the Company Indemnified Parties, as applicable, to make a claim
for a breach of any such covenant or agreement, which such breach occurred
prior to the expiration of the performance obligations pursuant to the terms
of such covenant or agreement, shall survive until the sixtieth (60th) day

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) No claim for indemnification may be asserted against the Equityholders for
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company
or the Equityholder Representative contained in this Agreement unless a Notice
of Claim has been received by the Equityholder Representative prior to the
date on which such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement expires as
set forth in Section 9.1(a); and if a Notice of Claim has been received by the
Equityholder Representative prior to such time, then the claim for
indemnification with respect to the matters set forth in such Notice of Claim
will survive until such later date as such claim for indemnification has been
fully and finally resolved in accordance with this Article IX. No claim for
indemnification may be asserted against Purchaser for breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Purchaser or Acquisition
Subsidiary under this Agreement unless a Notice of Claim has been received by
Purchaser prior to the date on which such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement expires as set forth in Section 9.1(a); and if a Notice of Claim
has been received by Purchaser prior to the date on which such representation,

each of its Affiliates (which, following the Closing, shall include the
Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries) and its and their
respective directors, officers, managers, partners, employees, equityholders,
agents, representatives and successors and assigns (each, a "Purchaser
Indemnified Party") for any Losses suffered, sustained or incurred by such

(i) the breach of any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in
Article IV or any certificate delivered with respect thereto to Purchaser at
the Closing;

  

  

(ii) Indemnified Taxes;

  

  

(iii) the breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this
Agreement to be performed at or prior to the Effective Time;

  

  

(iv) any payments paid or owed by the Surviving Corporation to any stockholder
of the Company with respect to any Dissenting Shares to the extent that the
aggregate amount of such payments, together with the aggregate amount of all
Losses with respect thereto, exceeds the consideration that otherwise would
have been payable to such stockholder of the Company pursuant to Article I
upon the exchange of such Dissenting Shares if such Company stockholder had
not exercised his, her or its right to dissent to the Merger pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL;

  

  

(v) any claim by a former stockholder or optionholder of the Company that the
proceeds payable to such stockholder or optionholder in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as set forth in the Allocation
Schedule, are inadequate;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(vi) any Actual Company Transaction Expenses that were not taken into account
for purposes of calculating the Final Company Transaction Expenses or the
Final Working Capital; or

  

  

(vii) the breach of any covenant or agreement of the Equityholder
Representative (in its capacity as such) contained in this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article IX, from and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify each Equityholder and each of its
Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, managers,
partners, employees, equityholders, agents, representatives and successors and
assigns (each, a "Company Indemnified Party") for any Losses suffered,
sustained or incurred by such Company Indemnified Party as a result of the
breach of:

  

  

(i) any representation and warranty of Purchaser and Acquisition Subsidiary
set forth in Article V or any certificate with respect thereto delivered to
the Company at the Closing; or

  

  

(ii) any covenant or agreement of Purchaser or Acquisition Subsidiary (or,
after the Closing, the Company) contained in this Agreement.

  

  

(c) For purposes of determining (i) whether there has been a breach of any
representation and warranty of the Company set forth in Article IV or any
certificate delivered with respect thereto to Purchaser at the Closing and
(ii) the Losses for any such breach, (A) each representation and warranty made
in this Agreement is made without any qualification or limitations as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect and (B) without limiting the foregoing,
the word "material", "Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import
shall be deemed deleted from any such representation or warranty; provided,
however, that materiality qualifications shall not be disregarded for purposes
of (I) the definition of Permitted Liens, Company Permits, Material Contracts,
Company Licensed Intellectual Property Rights or Company Intellectual Property
Rights, and any use of such terms in this Agreement, and (II) Sections
4.7(a)(i), 4.7(b) (including references to materiality in Section 6.1(b) for
the purposes of applying 4.7(b)), the last sentence of 4.14(a) and 4.18(e).

  

  

(d) To the extent any claim for indemnification could be brought by a
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) and any other
provision of Section 9.2(a), for this purpose without giving effect to the
survival periods referred to in Section 9.1 or the limitations on
indemnification set forth in Section 9.3(a), such claim for indemnification
may only be brought pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i), for this purpose giving
effect to the survival periods referred to in Section 9.1 and the limitations
on indemnification set forth in Section 9.3(a); provided, however, this
Section 9.2(d) shall not apply with respect to the covenants and agreements
set forth in Section 1.8.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 9.3 Limitations on Indemnification Amounts. The rights of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Company Indemnified Parties to
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Article IX are subject to
the following limitations:

  

  

(a) In no event shall (i) the Equityholders be required to provide
indemnification to any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to
any claim for indemnification made pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i): (A) if the
Losses associated with such claim (or group of related claims arising out of
the same or similar circumstances) are less than Fifty Thousand Dollars
($50,000) (the "De Minimis Claim Amount"); or (B) unless and until the Losses
associated with all claims for indemnification made pursuant to Section
9.2(a)(i) incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties aggregate at least
Four Million Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,400,000) (the "Indemnification
Deductible"), after which point the Equityholders shall only be required to
provide indemnification with respect to indemnifiable Losses with respect to
any such claim for indemnification made pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) in
excess of the Indemnification Deductible (for the avoidance of doubt, Losses
associated with any claim for which indemnification is unavailable hereunder
solely by reason of the limitation described in foregoing clause (i)(A) will
not be counted towards determining if the Indemnification Deductible has been
reached); provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the De Minimis Claim Amount and the Indemnification
Deductible shall not apply to any indemnification claims made with respect to
the Fundamental Company Representations, the representations set forth in
Section 4.13 (Taxes), indemnification claims made pursuant to Sections
9.2(a)(ii) through 9.2(a)(vii) or any claim based on intentional fraud; (ii)
the Equityholders be required to provide indemnification to the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for indemnifiable Losses arising from claims for
indemnification made pursuant to Sections 9.2(a)(i) in an aggregate amount in
excess of amount of the Escrow Deposit then remaining in the Escrow Account
(the "Indemnification Cap") except with respect to claims made with respect to
the Fundamental Company Representations or any claim based on intentional
fraud; and (iii) the Equityholders be required to provide indemnification to
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for indemnifiable Losses with respect to
Section 9.2(a) in an aggregate amount in excess of the Merger Consideration.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article IX: (i) in no
event shall Purchaser be required to provide indemnification to any of the
Company Indemnified Parties with respect to any claim for indemnification made
pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(i): (A) if the Losses associated with such claim
are less than the De Minimis Claim Amount; or (B) unless and until the Losses
associated with such claim incurred by the Company Indemnified Parties
aggregate at the Indemnification Deductible, after which point Purchaser shall
only be required to provide indemnification with respect to indemnifiable
Losses with respect to any such claim for indemnification made pursuant to
Section 9.2(b)(i) in excess of the Indemnification Deductible (for the
avoidance of doubt, Losses associated with any claim for which indemnification
is unavailable hereunder solely by reason of the limitation described in
foregoing clause (i)(A) will not be counted towards determining if the
Indemnification Deductible has been reached); provided, however, that the De
Minimis Claim Amount and the Indemnification Deductible shall not apply to any
indemnification claims made with respect to the Fundamental Purchaser
Representations or any claim based on intentional fraud; (ii) in no event
shall Purchaser be required to provide indemnification to the Company
Indemnified Parties for indemnifiable Losses arising from claims for
indemnification made pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(i) in an aggregate amount in
excess of the Indemnification Cap except with respect to claims based on
intentional fraud; and (iii) in no event shall Purchaser be required to
provide indemnification to the Company Indemnified Parties for indemnifiable
Losses with respect to Section 9.2(b) in an aggregate amount in excess of the
Merger Consideration.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) To the extent that any Loss that is otherwise indemnifiable pursuant to
this Article IX has been included in the calculation of Final Working Capital,
Final Cash or Final Company Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section 1.8(b),
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification for
such Loss pursuant to this Article IX, and such Loss shall not apply against
the De Minimis Claim Amount or the Indemnification Deductible. Conversely, to
the extent any Loss has been incurred that has been applied against the
Indemnification Deductible or is subject to a claim for indemnification by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article IX, the effect of such
Loss shall not be included in the determination of Final Working Capital,
Final Cash or Final Company Transaction Expenses for purposes of any
adjustment pursuant to Section 1.8 with respect to Working Capital, Available
Cash, Indebtedness or Company Transaction Expenses, as applicable.

  

  

Section 9.4 Indemnification Claim Procedure.

  

  

(a) Promptly after obtaining knowledge of any matter that a Purchaser
Indemnified Party or a Company Indemnified Party, acting in good faith,
reasonably believes will entitle such Purchaser Indemnified Party or Company
Indemnified Party (in such capacity, an "Indemnified Party") to
indemnification under this Article IX from any Person who would be obligated
to indemnify such Indemnified Party if the claim is indemnifiable hereunder
(such obligated Person, the "Indemnifying Party"), such Indemnified Party
shall promptly provide to the Equityholder Representative, if the Indemnified
Party is a Purchaser Indemnified Party, or to Purchaser, if the Indemnified
Party is a Company Indemnified Party (in this capacity, the "Indemnifying
Party Representative"), notice describing the matter in reasonable detail,
including the nature of the claim, the basis for the indemnification
obligation and the Losses resulting therefrom (a "Notice of Claim"); provided,
however, that the failure to timely provide a Notice of Claim hereunder shall
not relieve any Indemnifying Party of the obligation to indemnify such
Indemnified Party except to the extent that such Indemnified Party's failure
to provide or delay in providing a Notice of Claim actually prejudices the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against or contest or resolve such
matter.

  

  

(b) For claims for indemnification under this Article IX other than those
relating to Third Party Claims, during the period of thirty (30) Business Days
after delivery of the Notice of Claim, the Indemnifying Party Representative
may deliver to the Indemnified Party who delivered such Notice of Claim a
response (a "Response Notice") in which the Indemnifying Party Representative
(i) agrees that the full amount of Losses stated in the Notice of Claim is
owed to such Indemnified Party, (ii) agrees that part (but not all) of the
amount of Losses stated in the Notice of Claim is owed to such Indemnified
Party or (iii) asserts that no part of the amount of Losses stated in the
Notice of Claim is owed to such Indemnified Party. Unless the Indemnifying
Party Representative agrees in such Response Notice that the full amount of
Losses stated in the Notice of Claim is owed to such Indemnified Party, such
Response Notice shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the Indemnifying Party
Representative's objections to the claims and its basis for such objections.
If the Indemnifying Party Representative fails to provide such a Response
Notice to the Indemnified Party who delivered the related Notice of Claim
within such thirty (30) Business Day period, the Indemnifying Parties shall be
deemed to have objected to all of the claims set forth in the Notice of Claim
and the Indemnifying Party Representative or the Indemnified Party may
thereafter pursue any legal remedies available to it with respect to the
claims set forth in such Notice of Claim, subject, to the extent applicable,
to the De Minimis Claim Amount, the Indemnification Deductible, the
Indemnification Cap and the other provisions of this Article IX. If the
Indemnifying Party Representative provides a Response Notice within such
thirty (30) Business Day period and such Response Notice objects to any of the
claims set forth in the Notice of Claim, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party Representative, as the case may be, shall negotiate the
resolution of the claim(s) for a period of not less than thirty (30) Business
Days after such Response Notice is delivered to such Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party Representative are unable to
resolve all such claims within such time period, the Indemnified Party or
Indemnifying Party Representative may thereafter pursue any legal remedies
available to it with respect solely to the unresolved claims, subject, to the
extent applicable, to the De Minimis Claim Amount, the Indemnification
Deductible, the Indemnification Cap and the other provisions of this Article
IX.

Section 9.5 Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) The Indemnifying Party Representative shall have the right to assume and
pursue the defense of any claim or Proceeding by a third party (a "Third Party
Claim"), with legal counsel reasonably selected by it, upon notification
thereof to the Indemnified Party within sixty (60) days after the Notice of
Claim has been delivered to the Indemnifying Party Representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Indemnifying Party Representative
shall not have the right to assume or pursue the defense of a Third Party
Claim if (i) such Third Party Claim relates to a Proceeding that is reasonably
expected to result in imprisonment or any criminal action; (ii) such Third
Party Claim involves a request exclusively for equitable relief or any other
non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party; (iii) such third party
claim involves or is reasonably expected to involve a request for monetary
relief and also equitable relief or any other non-monetary relief against the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates which, if granted, would materially
and adversely impact the current or future business operations, assets or
properties, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) of the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates; (iv) such Third Party Claim involves a
Proceeding in which an Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are both
named parties to the applicable Proceeding and the Indemnified Party shall
have reasonably concluded based on the written advice of counsel (other than
internal counsel of any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties) that
representation of both parties by the same counsel, or the conduct of such
defense by the Indemnifying Party Representative, would be result in a
conflict of interest; (v) the Losses claimed or likely to be claimed in such
Third Party Claim will exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the amount
such Indemnified Party will be entitled to recover as a result of the
limitations on indemnification contained herein (including the Deductible and
the Indemnification Cap); or (vi) such Third Party Claim involves any
Governmental Authority as a party thereto, and, in each such case, the
Indemnified Party shall be indemnified for the reasonable fees and expenses of
its counsel (limited to one firm for all Indemnified Parties and, if
applicable, one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction for all
Indemnified Parties) if such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
with respect to such Third Party Claim pursuant to this Article IX.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Unless and until the Indemnified Party receives such notification from the
Indemnifying Party Representative within such sixty (60) day period that it
will assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, if the Indemnifying Party does
not have the right to assume and pursue the defense of such Third Party Claim
pursuant to Section 9.5(a) or, at any time after the Indemnifying Party
Representative has assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim if: (i) a
court of competent jurisdiction rules that the Indemnifying Party
Representative has failed to or is failing to vigorously prosecute and defend
such Third Party Claim or (ii) such Third Party Claim involves a Proceeding in
which an Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are both named parties
and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded based on the written
advice of counsel (other than internal counsel of any of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties) that representation of both parties by the same counsel,
or the conduct of such defense by the Indemnifying Party Representative, would
be result in a conflict of interest, the Indemnified Party shall thereafter
fully assume, commence and pursue its defense or settlement of such Third
Party Claim on a timely and prudent basis in its sole discretion (without
waiving any rights against the Indemnifying Parties) and promptly inform the
Indemnifying Party Representative of all material developments related
thereto.

  

  

(c) During the sixty (60) day period referred to in Section 9.5(a), the
Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide such
information to Indemnifying Party Representative as the Indemnifying Party
Representative may reasonably request in connection with its evaluation of
whether a Third Party Claim is an indemnifiable claim under this Article IX.
If during such sixty (60) day period the Indemnifying Party Representative
fails to acknowledge to the Indemnified Party that any Losses resulting from
such Third Party Claim are indemnifiable Losses for which the Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification under this Article IX, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 9.3, Section 9.13 and the other provisions of
this Article IX, the Indemnified Party may at any time after such sixty (60)
day period assume the defense of such Third Party Claim upon notice to that
effect to the Indemnifying Party Representative. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Indemnifying Party Representative's election to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim during such sixty (60) day period shall not constitute an
admission that any Losses resulting from such Third Party Claim are
indemnifiable Losses under this Article IX or in any way prejudice or limit
the Indemnifying Party Representative's ability to dispute any determination
of whether or not any such Losses are indemnifiable Losses under this Article
IX.

  

  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party Representative assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim, it shall thereafter promptly inform the Indemnified Party of all
material developments related thereto. With respect to any Third Party Claim
for which the Indemnifying Party Representative has assumed the defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate, at its own cost and expense, in the defense of such Third Party
Claim through legal counsel reasonably selected by it and, except to the
extent provided in Section 9.5(b), at its own cost and expense. The
Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, during normal
business hours, upon reasonable notice, cooperate in all reasonable ways with,
make its and their relevant files and records reasonably available for
inspection and copying by, make its and their employees reasonably available
to, and otherwise render reasonable assistance to, the Indemnifying Party
Representative.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) If the Indemnifying Party Representative (having assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim) or the Indemnified Party (having proceeded with its own
defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 9.5) proposes
to settle or compromise such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
Representative and the Indemnified Party, as applicable, shall provide notice
to that effect (together with a reasonably detailed statement of the terms and
conditions of such settlement or compromise) to the Indemnified Party or
Indemnifying Party Representative, as applicable, which notice shall be
provided a reasonable time prior to the proposed time for effecting such
settlement or compromise, and shall not affect any such settlement or
compromise without the prior consent of the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party Representative, as applicable, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If: (i) the Indemnifying Party
Representative provides any such notice; (ii) the related settlement or
compromise offer provides for (A) the full release of the Indemnified Party
from any and all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (B) involves
no admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, (C)
excludes any non-monetary relief that would limit or restrict the business or
operations of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates and (D) the monetary
relief contemplated by such settlement is fully covered by the Equityholders'
or Purchaser's, as the case may be, indemnification payments pursuant to this
Article IX; and (iii) the Indemnified Party fails to provide, in a reasonably
timely manner, its consent to such settlement or compromise, then
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article IX, the Indemnifying
Party's indemnification obligation under this Article IX with respect to such
Third Party Claim will not exceed the amount of such settlement or compromise
offer and the Indemnified Party will be required to pay the excess of the
amount necessary to settle or compromise such Third Party Claim over the
amount of such settlement or compromise offer.

  

  

Section 9.6 Recourse Against Insurance. The amount of any claim for
indemnification by any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX
shall be reduced to reflect any insurance proceeds recoverable by and paid to
any Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to the matter giving rise to such
claim (net of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for collection); provided that
in no event shall any indemnification payment be delayed in anticipation of
the receipt of any such insurance proceeds. Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Subsidiaries, following the Effective Time) to, in good faith, diligently seek
recovery, at its or their own expense (which shall be a Loss), of all
insurance proceeds from insurers with respect to all Losses with respect to
which any Purchaser Indemnified Party makes a claim for indemnification under
this Article IX; provided that nothing in this sentence shall require
Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and the
Company Subsidiaries, following the Effective Time) to seek recovery of
insurance proceeds prior to pursuing indemnification pursuant to this Article
IX. To the extent that Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries, following the Effective
Time) receives any amount under insurance coverage with respect to a matter
for which it has previously received payment in indemnification pursuant to
this Article IX, Purchaser shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
receipt of such insurance proceeds, pay and reimburse to the Escrow Agent (if
such reimbursement is to be delivered during the Escrow Period) or to the
Equityholder Representative (if such reimbursement is to be delivered after
the end of the Escrow Period), for any prior indemnification payment (up to
the amount of such insurance proceeds, less any retroactive premium
adjustments directly attributable thereto, and net of out-of-pocket expenses
for collection).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 9.7 Recourse Against Third Parties. The amount of any claim for
indemnification by any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX
shall be reduced to reflect any amounts recoverable by and paid to any
Purchaser Indemnified Party from any third party (other than an insurer, which
shall be governed by Section 9.6) with respect to the matter giving rise to
such claim (net of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for collection);
provided, that in no event shall any indemnification payment be delayed in
anticipation of the receipt of any such amounts. To the extent that Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Subsidiaries, following the Effective Time) receives any amount from a third
party with respect to a matter for which it has previously received payment in
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX, Purchaser shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the receipt of such amounts, reimburse to the
Escrow Agent (if such reimbursement is to be delivered during the Escrow
Period) or to the Equityholder Representative (if such reimbursement is to be
delivered after the Escrow Period), for any prior indemnification payment (up
to the amount of such recovered amounts and net of out-of-pocket expenses for
collection).

  

  

Section 9.8 Mitigation of Damages. Each Indemnified Party shall be required to
use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the amount of any Losses for
which a claim for indemnification is or can be made by such Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Article IX.

  

  

Section 9.9 Tax Offset. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Article IX or elsewhere in this Agreement, (a) any indemnification payment to
be made to any Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses hereunder shall be
reduced by the value of any Tax benefit available to any Indemnified Party
relating to such Losses in any Tax year in which or prior to which such Losses
were incurred, and (b) to the extent any Indemnified Party realizes a Tax
benefit relating to such Losses in either of the two (2) Tax years immediately
succeeding the Tax year in which such Losses were incurred, the Indemnified
Party shall pay the amount of such Tax benefit (but not in excess of the
indemnification payments actually received from the Indemnifying Party with
respect to such Losses) to Purchaser, if Purchaser is the party providing such
indemnification, or the Equityholder Representative, if the Equityholders are
the party providing such indemnification.

  

  

Section 9.10 Waiver of Certain Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article IX or elsewhere in this Agreement, in no event shall
any Indemnified Party be entitled to receive indemnification under this
Article IX for exemplary or punitive damages or duplicative Losses; provided,
however, that this limitation shall not apply if, and solely to the extent
that, such Indemnified Party is seeking to obtain through indemnification
reimbursement of Losses resulting from an award in a Third Party Claim against
such Indemnified Party of consequential, special, incidental, indirect,
exemplary or punitive damages, loss of future revenue, income or profits, loss
of benefit of the bargain or similar items.

  

  

Section 9.11 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any indemnification
payments made pursuant to this Article IX shall be treated for all Tax
purposes as adjustments to the Merger Consideration paid for the Company
Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and for
cancellation of the Participating Options, which adjustment shall be
calculated for each share of Company Capital Stock and each Participating
Option as if the dollar amount set forth in Section 1.6(a)(i) had been, at the
Effective Time, reduced by the amount of such indemnification payment (if made
to a Purchaser Indemnified Party) or increased by the amount of such
indemnification payment (if made to an Equityholder Indemnified Party) and the
Per Share Series A Merger Consideration, Per Share Series B Merger
Consideration, Per Share Series C Merger Consideration, Per Share Common
Merger Consideration and the Option Payments were calculated in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement based upon such adjusted
amount.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 9.12 Source of Recovery.

  

  

(a) Any valid indemnification claims brought by any of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall be paid: (i) first, from
the Escrow Deposit (to the extent of the Escrow Deposit, if any, then
remaining in the Escrow Account), in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, and
Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative shall promptly cause such
payment to be delivered to Purchaser under the terms of the Escrow Agreement;
and (ii) if such payment is not satisfied by the preceding clause (i) and this
Agreement contemplates recovery in excess of the Escrow Deposit with respect
to such claim, by payment by each Equityholder to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties of such Equityholder's pro rata share (based on the respective
Participation Percentages of the Equityholders) of the excess. From and after
the time a RandW Insurance Policy is obtained, the provisions of Section
6.14(b)(iii) shall apply to this Section 9.12(a).

  

  

(b) Any valid indemnification claims brought by any of the Company Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Section 9.2(b) shall be paid by Purchaser by wire transfer
of immediately available funds within fifteen (15) Business Days after it is
determined pursuant to this Article IX that any amount is due to any Company
Indemnified Parties hereunder to such account as the Company Indemnified
Parties may designate reasonably in advance of such payment.

  

  

Section 9.13 Exclusive Remedy.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 9.13(b), notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or otherwise: (i) following the Effective Time,
none of the Equityholders or any of the directors, officers, managers,
partners, employees, equityholders, agents or representatives of the Company
or its Affiliates as of immediately prior to the Closing shall have any
liability of any kind to Purchaser or any other Purchaser Indemnified Party,
subject only to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' ability to bring
indemnification claims pursuant to this Article IX; and (ii) Purchaser, on
behalf of itself and all other Purchaser Indemnified Parties, hereby
irrevocably waives any right to any other remedy following the Closing,
whether for any breach of any representations and warranties and covenants and
agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement or otherwise with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence of this
Section 9.13, the rights and claims waived by Purchaser and the other
Purchaser Indemnified Parties under this Section 9.13 include claims for
contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any
Environmental Law (whether now or hereinafter in effect), claims for fraud
(whether intentional, reckless, negligent, constructive or otherwise, except
for intentional fraud as expressly provided for in, and as limited by, Section
9.13(b)), breach of contract, breach of representations and warranties,
misrepresentation (whether intentional, reckless, negligent or otherwise),
negligence, gross negligence, willful misconduct and all other claims, whether
based in in contract, tort, breach of duty or otherwise. Purchaser hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably waives, for itself and for each of the other
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, any rights of set off, netting, offset,
recoupment or similar rights that any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties has
or may have with respect to any payments to be made by Purchaser of any other
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement or any other document
or instrument delivered by Purchaser or Acquisition Subsidiary in connection
herewith, except with respect to any claims they may have under this Agreement
which are not limited to the Escrow Deposit (but, in such case, solely with
respect to amounts in excess of the Escrow Deposit then remaining).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Section 9.13(a) shall not apply to: (i) any liability to pay adjustments
to Available Cash or Working Capital under Section 1.8; (ii) specific
performance or injunctive relief for post-Closing covenants in accordance with
Section 12.13; or (iii) any claim in a Proceeding against the Equityholders
that the Company has committed intentional fraud with respect to any
representation and warranty of the Company set forth in Article IV; provided,
however, that: (A) the maximum amount of Losses with respect to any and all
such claims of intentional fraud payable by each Person who was an
Equityholder of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not
exceed the aggregate portion of the Merger Consideration received by such
Person; and (B) if a claim for intentional fraud is made, then the party
prevailing with respect to such claim shall be entitled to reimbursement from
the other party for all fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' and
accountants' fees and court costs) incurred by such prevailing party with
respect to such claim and any Proceeding with respect thereto. With respect to
the preceding clause (B), the party alleging intentional fraud shall be deemed
to prevail with respect to such claim if a court of competent jurisdiction
under Section 12.11 determines by a final non-appealable Order of such court
that the party defending such claim has committed intentional fraud and the
party defending such claim shall be deemed to prevail in all other
circumstances.

  

  

(c) Purchaser and Acquisition Subsidiary acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this Section 9.13 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
Company would not enter into this Agreement.

Section 10.3 Replacement of the Equityholder Representative. If the
Equityholder Representative is dissolved, resigns from such position, files
for bankruptcy or is the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy petition that is
not dismissed within thirty (30) days after filing, it shall designate a
replacement Equityholder Representative prior to such dissolution, resignation
or bankruptcy or, if the Equityholder Representative shall fail to do so, a
replacement Equityholder Representative shall be appointed by Tailwind;
provided that the resignation of the Equityholder Representative shall become
effective only upon the appointment of a replacement Equityholder

instrument. Neither the exercise (from time to time and at any time) by a
party of, nor the delay or failure (at any time or for any period of time) to
exercise, any right, power or remedy shall constitute a waiver of the right to
exercise, or impair, limit or restrict the exercise of, such right, power or
remedy or any other right, power or remedy at any time and from time to time
thereafter. No waiver of any right, power or remedy of a party shall be deemed
to be a waiver of any other right, power or remedy of such party or shall,

as applicable, and specifies the provision(s) that are being waived, which
waiver shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such
written instrument. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, compliance with this Section 12.5, Section 8.3(b), this Section
12.4, Section 12.11 and Section 12.15 (including the related definitions) may
not be waived if such wavier would be adverse to the Financing Sources (or
such Financing Source's Affiliates, equityholders, members, partners,
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and Representatives (or any
of their respective successors or assigns)) without the prior written consent
of the Financing Sources.

CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE COMMITMENT

CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE TRANSACTIONS

AGENT, ADVISOR OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY PROCEEDING
ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
SUCH WAIVER, (iii) SUCH PARTY MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) SUCH

Section 12.13 Remedies. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.13, each of
the parties shall have and retain all rights and remedies, at law or in
equity, including rights to specific performance and injunctive or other
equitable relief, arising out of or relating to a breach or threatened breach
of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
the parties acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy
for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement and that irreparable
harm would result if this Agreement were not specifically enforced. Therefore,
the rights and obligations of the parties shall be enforceable by a decree of
specific performance issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, and
appropriate injunctive relief shall be granted in connection therewith,
without the necessity of posting a bond or other security or proving
irrevocable harm and without regard to the adequacy of any remedy at law. Each
of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief when available pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an adequate
remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or equity. No breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the
part of Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, after consummation of the
Merger, to rescind this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties further agree that (i) by seeking the
remedies provided for in this Section 12.13, a party shall

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

101  

  

 

 

 

  

  

not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may
be available to a party under this Agreement and (ii) nothing contained in
this Section 12.13 shall require any party to initiate any claim for (or limit
any party's right to institute any claim for) specific performance under this
Section 12.13 before exercising any initiate right under Article VIII (and
pursuing damages after such termination) nor shall the commencement of any
claim pursuant to this Section 12.13 or anything contained in this Section
12.13 restrict or limit any party's right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of Article VIII or pursue any other remedies under
this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of Purchaser's
obligations to consummate the Merger only in the event that each of the
following conditions has been satisfied: (i) the Marketing Period has ended
and all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Sections 7.2(d), 7.2(e)
and 7.2(f) have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing), (ii) Purchaser
fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have
occurred pursuant to Section 1.4, (iii) there has not been a Financing
Failure, and (iv) the Company has confirmed in a written notice delivered to
Purchaser that if specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded,
then the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific performance as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by this Section 12.13 and the payment of the Purchaser
Termination Fee (only to the extent expressly permitted by Section 8.3), under
no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both
such grant of specific performance and payment of the Purchaser Termination
Fee. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 12.13 and Section 9.13, a
party's right to specific performance or injunctive relief shall be in
addition to all other legal or equitable remedies available to such party.

  

  

Section 12.14 Privileged Property; Representation by Kelley Drye.

  

  

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that Kelley Drye has served as legal counsel to
each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries historically, including in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that Kelley Drye also serves as legal counsel to Tailwind and
certain of the Equityholders. The parties understand and agree that the
Equityholders, or any of them, and Tailwind shall be entitled to retain Kelley
Drye as their counsel in any dispute between Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of
the Equityholders or Tailwind, on the other hand, arising from or related to
the Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby,
notwithstanding Kelley Drye's prior or potential ongoing representation of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries, and
notwithstanding that the interests of any of the Equityholders and Tailwind,
on the one hand, and Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, could be directly adverse to one another.
Purchaser waives and shall not assert, and agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to waive and to not assert after the
Effective Time, any conflict of interest arising out of the representation by
Kelley Drye, after the Effective Time, of any of the Equityholders, Tailwind
or any director, officer, manager, partner, employee or equityholder of any of
them in any matter arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

102  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time only the Equityholder Representative
shall have the right to control, assert and waive the attorney-client
privilege with respect to any attorney-client communications made at any time
prior to the Effective Time between or among the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, Tailwind, any of the Equityholders and Kelley Drye relating to
this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby or any
attorney work-product documentation prepared by Kelley Drye relating to this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively,
the "Privileged Property"). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
Privileged Property in the possession of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall become the exclusive property of the Equityholder
Representative, as representative of the Equityholders, notwithstanding that
some of the Privileged Property may inadvertently have come or come into the
possession of Purchaser or any of the Purchaser Representatives or remain in
the possession of the Surviving Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries. In
the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser, the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries and a third party other than Tailwind or any of the
Equityholders, the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary shall assert
the attorney-client privilege on behalf of Tailwind and the Equityholders in
order to prevent disclosure of Privileged Property to such third party;
provided, however, that such privilege may be waived only with the prior
written consent of the Equityholder Representative.

  

  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement, including Sections 12.14(a) and (b) shall be
deemed to be a waiver of any applicable attorney-client privilege. Each party
understands and agrees that notwithstanding the reasonable efforts of the
parties to prevent the disclosure of Privileged Property, the consummation of
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may result in
the inadvertent disclosure of Privileged Property and that any such disclosure
shall not prejudice or otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege
with respect to any of the Privileged Property. Purchaser shall, and from and
after the Effective Time Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
the Company Subsidiaries to, deliver to the Equityholder Representative any
inadvertently disclosed or retained Privileged Property promptly upon becoming
aware of the existence thereof.

  

  

Section 12.15 Third Party Beneficiaries. No Person other than Purchaser,
Acquisition Subsidiary, the Company and the Equityholder Representative is, is

any successors and permitted assigns of the parties under Section 12.3 (who
are intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement), (b) the then former

assigns, heirs, beneficiaries, legatees and legal representatives (who are
intended beneficiaries of Section 3.5, Section 3.7 and Article IX and shall

are intended beneficiaries of Sections 8.3(b), 12.4, 12.5, 12.11 and this
12.15 and shall have the right to enforce Sections 8.3(b), 12.4, 12.5, 12.11
and this 12.15).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

103

Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.
