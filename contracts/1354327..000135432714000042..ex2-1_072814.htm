WHEREAS, the Company, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary CGI Windows

Acquisition Sub with and into the Company in accordance with, and subject to,
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the

Sub shall become the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, unless and until
altered, amended or repealed as provided in the DGCL, the Surviving

(a) At the Effective Time, upon delivery by each Stockholder to the Surviving
Corporation of a properly executed Letter of Transmittal or an Option
Cancellation Form, in each instance, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D
and surrender by each Stockholder to the Surviving Corporation of (A) the
certificate(s) which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
Merger Shares or (B) the Merger Options, as applicable, such Stockholder
shall, from and after the Effective Time in accordance with the provisions
hereof (including Section 2.2(b) below), be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the cash which such Stockholder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1 above, as applicable, but reduced by the amount, if any, such
Stockholder owes to the Company under any Notes Receivable plus interest
accrued thereon through the Closing Date. The Per Share Closing Amount payable

Surviving Corporation shall be closed with respect to the capital stock of the
Company, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of the

Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Estimated Working Capital, Estimated Cash on Hand, Estimated Indebtedness.
At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to the Buyer a balance sheet of the Acquired Entities containing (i)
the Company's good faith estimate of the Working Capital as of the Closing
Date (the "Estimated Working Capital"), (ii) the Company's good faith estimate
of the Cash on Hand as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Cash on Hand") and
(iii) the Company's good faith estimate of the Acquired Entity Indebtedness as
of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Indebtedness"), prepared based on the same
principles and methodology utilized in preparing the Financial Statements,
together with all work papers and copies of source documents that reasonably
support and document the Company's determination in preparing such balance
sheet. Buyer shall have the right to review such balance sheet prior to
Closing, and the Company shall revise such balance sheet prior to Closing to
reflect Buyer's reasonable comments to the extent such comments are not
inconsistent with the principles and methodology utilized in preparing the
Financial Statements (such balance sheet, reflecting any amendments in
accordance with this Section, the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"). If the
Estimated Working Capital reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet is
less than the Working Capital Target, then the Closing Consideration to be
paid pursuant to Section 2.2 will be decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount
of such shortfall. If the Estimated Working Capital reflected on the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet is greater than the Working Capital Target, then the
Closing Consideration to be paid pursuant to Section 1.6(c)(i) will be
increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such excess. If the Estimated
Cash on Hand is less than zero dollars ($0), then the Closing Consideration to
be paid pursuant to Section 1.6(c)(i) will be decreased dollar-for-dollar by
the amount of such shortfall. If the Estimated Cash on Hand is greater than
zero dollars ($0), then the Closing Consideration to be paid pursuant to
Section 1.6(c)(i) will be increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such
excess. If the Estimated Indebtedness is greater than zero dollars ($0), then
the Closing Consideration to be paid pursuant to Section 1.6(c)(i) will be
decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such excess. For the avoidance of
doubt, no adjustments to the Closing Consideration made pursuant to this
Section 2.4 shall be double counted.

  

  

(b) Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash on Hand, Actual Indebtedness. As soon
as practicable after the Closing Date, but not later than forty-five (45) days
after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the
Stockholders' Representative (i) a balance sheet of the Acquired Entities as
of the Closing Date (the "Final Closing Balance Sheet") reflecting all
adjustments made by the Buyer to the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet that are
consistent with GAAP, and including (A) the Buyer's calculation of the Working
Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Actual Working Capital"), (B) the Buyer's
calculation of the Cash on Hand as of the Closing Date (the "Actual Cash on
Hand") and (C) the Buyer's calculation of the Acquired Entity Indebtedness as
of the Closing Date (the "Actual Indebtedness") and (ii) all work papers and
copies of source documents that reasonably support and document the Buyer's
determination of the Final Closing Balance Sheet, the Actual Working Capital,
the Actual Cash on Hand and the Actual Indebtedness.

  

  

(c) Review by the Stockholders' Representative.

  

  

(i) Concurrently with the delivery of the Final Closing Balance Sheet by the
Buyer to the Stockholders' Representative, the Buyer also shall deliver to the
Stockholders' Representative a notice (the "Notice of Adjustment") setting
forth the proposed adjustment, if any, of the Closing Consideration as
contemplated by Section 2.4(d ), Section 2.4(e) or Section 2.4(f). During the
preparation of the Final Closing Balance Sheet until the Final Determination
Date, the Buyer shall (A) provide the Stockholders' Representative and its
advisors with timely access to the personnel, work papers, trial balances,
relevant books and records and similar materials used, and (B) give the
Stockholders' Representative reasonable advance notice of, and permit the
Stockholders' Representative and its advisors to observe, any physical
inventory conducted, in connection with the preparation of the Final Closing
Balance Sheet.

  

  

(ii) Following receipt of the Notice of Adjustment, the Stockholders'
Representative and its advisors will be afforded a period of twenty (20)
Business Days (the "20-Day Period") to review the Notice of Adjustment. At or
before the end of the 20-Day Period, the Stockholders' Representative may
deliver to the Buyer a written notice (the "Objection Notice") containing an
explanation of those items in the Final Balance Sheet which the Stockholders'
Representative disputes, in which case the items identified by the
Stockholders' Representative shall be deemed to be in dispute. If the
Stockholders' Representative fails to deliver an Objection Notice within such
20-Day Period, the Actual Working Capital, the Actual Cash on Hand and the
Actual Indebtedness will be deemed to be accepted by the Stockholders'
Representative and finally determined as set forth in the Notice of
Adjustment.

  

  

(iii) If the Stockholders' Representative delivers the Objection Notice within
the 20-Day Period, then (A) to the extent that any amounts contained in the
Notice of Adjustment are not disputed by the Stockholders' Representative, the
Parties shall make a determination of (x) the Actual Working Capital without
regard to any disputed amounts (the "Undisputed Working Capital"), (y) the
Actual Cash on Hand without regard to any disputed amounts (the "Undisputed
Cash on Hand"), and (z) the Actual Indebtedness without regard to any disputed
amounts (the "Undisputed Indebtedness"), and the Buyer or the Stockholders'
Representative, as the case may be, shall make a payment in accordance with
2.4(d ), Section 2.4(e) or Section 2.4(f) as if the Undisputed Working
Capital, the Undisputed Cash on Hand and the Undisputed Indebtedness were the
Actual Working Capital, the Actual Cash on Hand and the Actual Indebtedness,
respectively, in each case, as finally determined, and (B) within a further
period of twenty (20) Business Days commencing on the date following the
termination of the 20-Day Period the Parties and, if desired, their
accountants will attempt to resolve in good faith any disputed amounts, and
only such disputed amounts, and reach a written agreement (the "Settlement
Agreement") with respect thereto, in which case the Actual Working Capital,
the Actual Cash on Hand or the Actual Indebtedness (as the case may be) shall
be as set forth in the Settlement Agreement. Failing such resolution, the
unresolved disputed amounts will be referred for final binding resolution to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the "Arbitrating Accountants"), the fees and
expenses of which shall be borne as provided below. In such case, the Actual
Working Capital, the Actual Cash on Hand or the Actual Indebtedness (as the
case may be) will be deemed to be as determined by the Arbitrating
Accountants. Such determination (the "Accountants' Determination") shall be
(I) made solely in reliance upon supporting documentation provided to the
Arbitrating Accountants by the Buyer or the Stockholders' Representative
within twenty (20) days of submission of the unresolved disputed amounts to
the Arbitrating Accountants, (II) in writing, (III) furnished to the
Stockholders' Representative and the Buyer as soon as practicable after the
items in dispute have been referred to the Arbitrating Accountants, and (IV)
absent manifest error, nonappealable by the Stockholders' Representative, the
Stockholders, the Company, the Buyer and each of their respective Affiliates
and successors and not subject to collateral attack for any reason. The fees
and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountants shall be paid on a proportionate
basis by the Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative based on the inverse
proportion of the respective percentages of the dollar value of disputed
amounts determined in favor of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Stockholders' Representative, on the other hand.

  

  

(d) Working Capital Adjustment. After the final determination of the Actual
Working Capital in accordance with this Section 2.4, the Closing Consideration
shall be adjusted as follows:

  

  

(i) If the Actual Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Working
Capital reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (the amount of such
excess being referred to herein as the "Underpayment Amount"), then, within
five (5) Business Days following the Final Determination Date, the Closing
Consideration shall be increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of the
Underpayment Amount and the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Stockholders' Representative an aggregate amount equal to (A) the Underpayment
Amount, minus (B) any payments of Undisputed Working Capital and interest
accrued thereon, if any, made by the Buyer pursuant to Section 2.4(c), plus
(C) any payments of Undisputed Working Capital and interest accrued thereon,
if any, made by the Stockholders' Representative pursuant to Section 2.4(c).

  

  

(ii) If the Actual Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital
reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (the amount of such shortfall
being referred to herein as the "Overpayment Amount"), then, within five (5)
Business Days following the Final Determination Date, the Closing
Consideration shall be decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of the
Overpayment Amount and the Stockholders' Representative shall pay, or cause to
be paid, to the Buyer an aggregate amount equal to (A) the Overpayment Amount,
minus (B) any payments of Undisputed Working Capital and interest accrued
thereon, if any, made by the Stockholders' Representative pursuant to Section
2.4(c), plus (C) any payments of Undisputed Working Capital and interest
accrued thereon, if any, made by the Buyer pursuant to Section 2.4(c). Any
amount payable by the Stockholders' Representative pursuant to this Section
2.4(d) shall first be paid out of the Working Capital Escrow Amount in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(e) Cash on Hand Adjustment. After the final determination of the Actual Cash
on Hand in accordance with this Section 2.4, the Closing Consideration shall
be adjusted as follows:

  

  

(i) If the Actual Cash on Hand is greater than the Estimated Cash on Hand
reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (the amount of such excess
being referred to herein as the "Additional Cash on Hand"), then, within five
(5) Business Days following the Final Determination Date, the Closing
Consideration shall be increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of the
Additional Cash on Hand and the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Stockholders' Representative an aggregate amount equal (A) the Additional Cash
on Hand, minus (B) any payments of Undisputed Cash on Hand and interest
accrued thereon, if any, made by the Buyer pursuant to Section 2.4(c), plus
(C) any payments of Undisputed Cash on Hand and interest accrued thereon, if
any, made by the Stockholders' Representative pursuant to Section 2.4(c).

  

  

(ii) If the Actual Cash on Hand is less than the Estimated Cash on Hand
reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (the amount of such shortfall
being referred to herein as the "Cash on Hand Deficit"), then, within five (5)
Business Days following the Final Determination Date, the Closing
Consideration shall be decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of the Cash
on Hand Deficit and the Stockholders' Representative shall pay, or cause to be
paid, to the Buyer an aggregate amount equal to (A) the Cash on Hand Deficit,
minus (B) any payments of Undisputed Cash on Hand and interest accrued
thereon, if any, made by the Stockholders' Representative pursuant to Section
2.4(c), plus (C) any payments of Undisputed Cash on Hand and interest accrued
thereon, if any, made by the Buyer pursuant to Section 2.4(c). Any amount
payable by the Stockholders' Representative pursuant to this Section 2.4(e)
shall first be paid out of the Working Capital Escrow Amount in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(f) Indebtedness Adjustment. After the final determination of the Actual
Indebtedness in accordance with this Section 2.4, the Closing Consideration
shall be adjusted as follows:

  

  

(i) If the Actual Indebtedness is greater than the Estimated Indebtedness
reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (the amount of such shortfall
being referred to herein as the "Additional Indebtedness"), then, within five
(5) Business Days following the Final Determination Date, the Closing
Consideration shall be decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of the
Additional Indebtedness and the Stockholders' Representative shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to the Buyer an aggregate amount equal to (A) the Additional
Indebtedness, minus (B) any payments of Undisputed Indebtedness and interest
accrued thereon, if any, made by the Stockholders' Representative pursuant to
Section 2.4(c), plus (C) any payments of Undisputed Indebtedness and interest
accrued thereon, if any, made by the Buyer pursuant to Section 2.4(c). Any
amount payable by the Stockholders' Representative pursuant to this Section
2.4(e) shall first be paid out of the Working Capital Escrow Amount in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(g) In the event that any Party owes or is obligated to pay any amounts
pursuant to this Section 2.4, and such Party fails to pay such amounts when
due, interest shall accrue on any and all such amounts from the date such
payment is due at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, compounded daily,
until fully paid (or at the maximum amount then permitted by Law, if less).

  

  

(h) Accounting Books and Records. The Buyer agrees that, following the Closing
through the Final Determination Date, it will not, and will cause the Acquired
Entities not to, take any actions with respect to any accounting books or
records (such as the storage or destruction thereof) on which the Actual
Working Capital or the Actual Cash on Hand is to be based or derived from that
would impede or delay in any material respect the determination of the Actual
Working Capital or the Actual Cash on Hand in the manner and utilizing the
methods required by this Agreement.

Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under any
applicable Law with respect to the making of such payment. If the Acquired
Entities, the Surviving Corporation, the Buyer or the Stockholders'
Representative, as the case may be, so withholds any such amounts, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the applicable Person in respect of which the Acquired Entities, the
Surviving Corporation, the Buyer or the Stockholders' Representative, as the
case may be, made such deduction and withholding, and such deductions and
withholdings shall be paid over to the applicable Governmental Authorities in
a timely manner.

Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time held by Stockholders who shall have
not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in
writing and who shall have properly exercised their appraisal rights with
respect thereto under Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares collectively
referred to as the "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such Stockholder
fails to perfect, or otherwise loses, appraisal rights under the DGCL) shall
not be converted into the right to receive the applicable form of
consideration pursuant to the Merger, but shall be entitled to receive payment
of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL, except that each Dissenting Share held by a Stockholder who
shall thereafter withdraw his or her demand for appraisal or shall fail to
perfect or otherwise waive or lose his or her right to such payment as
provided in such Section 262 shall be deemed to be converted, as of the
Effective Time, into the right to receive the applicable consideration in the
form such holder otherwise would have been entitled to receive as a result of
the Merger. The Stockholders' Representative and the Company shall enforce any
contractual waivers that Stockholders have granted regarding appraisal rights
or similar rights that would apply to the Merger. The Company shall provide
Buyer prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand
and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Buyer
shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands.

commitment letter, together with all term sheets and other attachments thereto
that are attached hereto, the "Commitment Letter," and the debt financing
committed pursuant to the Commitment Letter, the "Financing"). At the Closing,

letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and no such
withdrawal is presently contemplated. As of the date of this Agreement, no

constitute a default or event of default or Breach on the part of Buyer or
Acquisition Sub under the Commitment Letter, or (to the knowledge or Buyer or
Acquisition Sub) on the part of any other party under the Commitment Letter.
As of the date of this Agreement, neither Buyer nor Acquisition Sub has any
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be
satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing will not be available to
Buyer or Acquisition Sub on the Closing Date; provided, in each case, the
Buyer is not making any representation or warranty regarding the effect of the
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in Article III, or compliance

other agreements, Contracts or arrangements to which Buyer or Acquisition Sub
is a party related to the funding of the commitment amounts set forth in the
Commitment Letter, other than the Commitment Letter.

Financing Covenant.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange the Financing as promptly as practicable and in a timely
fashion on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter,
including using reasonable best efforts to (a) maintain in effect the
commitment for the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letter, (b) negotiate
and execute definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including any flex terms in
the Commitment Letter) and (c) satisfy (and cause its Affiliates to satisfy),
on a timely basis, taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing
Period, all conditions applicable to Buyer and its Affiliates in such
Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements related thereto that are
within its or its Affiliates' control. In the event that all conditions to the
commitment of any counterparty to the Commitment Letter providing such
Financing have been satisfied, Buyer shall take reasonable best efforts to
cause the lenders and the other Persons providing the Financing to fund when
required hereunder the Financing required to consummate the Transactions
contemplated hereby. Buyer shall not permit any amendment or modification to
be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under the Commitment
Letter (except in compliance with the flex provisions of the Fee Letter as in
effect as of the date hereof), if such amendment, modification or waiver
reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by changing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount), amends the conditions
precedent to the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
delay or prevent the Closing Date or make the funding of the Financing less
likely to occur, adversely impacts the ability of Buyer to enforce or cause
the enforcement of its rights under any of the Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements relating thereto or imposes additional material
obligations on the Company, or other Acquired Businesses prior to the Closing
Date. If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
(including any applicable flex terms) and conditions contemplated in the
Commitment Letter, or Buyer becomes aware of any event or circumstance that
could reasonably be expected to make any portion of the Financing unavailable
on the terms (including any applicable flex terms) and conditions contemplated
in the Commitment Letter, then Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain in replacement thereof, and to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from alternative
sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions, with terms
(including any applicable flex terms) and conditions that are not materially
less favorable to Buyer and Acquisition Sub, taken as a whole, than the terms

to the party or parties providing indemnity ("Indemnitor") of any matter which
may give rise to a claim for indemnification which it discovers or of which it
receives notice after the Closing, stating the nature, basis and (to the
extent known) amount thereof; provided, however, that no delay on the part of
Indemnitee in notifying any Indemnitor shall relieve Indemnitor from any
Liability hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) Indemnitor is
prejudiced by such delay. Copies of any papers received in connection with
such matter shall be forwarded to Indemnitor together with the notice of the
matter.

  

  

(b) In case of any Action by a third party or by any Governmental Authority,
or any Action involving claims brought by such a third party or Governmental
Authority with respect to which Indemnitor may have Liability under the
indemnification provisions contained in this ARTICLE IX (a "Third-Party
Claim"), then Indemnitor shall have the right to assume the defense thereof at
its own expense and by its own counsel, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Indemnitee, by providing written notice to Indemnitee
confirming Indemnitor's irrevocable and unconditional obligation to fully
indemnify (subject to the limitations on indemnification contained herein)
Indemnitee against any Damages that may result from the Third-Party Claim;
provided, however, that Indemnitor shall not have the right to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim if (i) the Third-Party Claim does not
involve solely monetary damages, (ii) Indemnitee shall have been advised by
counsel that there are one or more legal or equitable defenses available to
Indemnitee that are different from or in addition to those available to
Indemnitor and, in the reasonable opinion of Indemnitee, counsel for
Indemnitor could not adequately represent Indemnitee's interests because they
conflict with those of Indemnitor, (iii) such Third-Party Claim involves, or
could have a material effect on, any material matter beyond the scope of the
indemnification obligation of Indemnitor (including damages sought in excess
of the then-remaining Escrow Holdback Amount), (iv) Indemnitor shall not have
assumed the defense of such Third-Party Claim in a timely fashion or (v) the
insurer under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy has assumed the
defense of such Third-Party Claim in accordance with the terms of the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy. If Indemnitor shall assume the
defense of a Third-Party Claim (under circumstances in which the proviso in
the preceding sentence is not applicable), Indemnitor shall not be responsible
for any legal or other defense costs subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in
connection with the defense thereof. If Indemnitor does not exercise its
rights to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim or is otherwise restricted
from so assuming such defense, Indemnitor shall nevertheless be entitled to
participate in such defense with its own counsel and at its own expense; and
in any such case Indemnitee may assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim,
with counsel that shall be reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitor, and shall
act reasonably and in accordance with its good faith business judgment and
shall not effect any settlement without the consent of Indemnitor, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If Indemnitor exercises
its right to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, it shall not effect
any settlement without the consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, that such consent shall not be
required where (i) the terms of such settlement do not include or require any
finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of
any Person, (ii) pursuant to the terms of such settlement the sole relief to
be provided is monetary damages that are to be paid in full by Indemnitor and
(iii) the terms of such settlement are not reasonably expected to affect the
Taxes of the Acquired Entity, the Buyer or their Affiliates after the Closing
Date.

  

  

(c) The Indemnitee shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue any claims for insurance with respect to any
claims or Damages for which it is seeking indemnification hereunder, and

  

  

(d) This Section 9.4 shall control any examination, investigation, audit or
other proceeding related to Taxes.

Limitations on Indemnification Liability.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) Limitation for Stockholders. The Stockholders' aggregate Liability for
indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 9.2(a),
Section 9.2(b), and Section 9.2(c) shall not exceed the Escrow Holdback Amount
(the "Maximum Amount"); provided, however, that the Maximum Amount shall not
apply with respect to any claim based on fraud by any Acquired Entity.
Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in the preceding sentence, Buyer, on
behalf of itself and each other Buyer Indemnified Person, acknowledges and
agrees that the sole and exclusive remedy of any Buyer Indemnified Person
beyond the Maximum Amount for any claim related to, arising under or in
connection with or pursuant to Section 9.2(a), Section 9.2(b) or Section
9.2(c) shall be to make a claim against the Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy. The Buyer, on behalf of itself and each other Buyer
Indemnified Person, further acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of
this Section 9.5(a) shall apply regardless if (i) Buyer obtains at or
following Closing or maintains following Closing the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy, (ii) the Representation and Warranty Insurance
Policy is revoked, cancelled or modified in any manner after issuance, or
(iii) any Buyer Indemnified Person makes a claim under the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy and such claim is denied by the insurer.

  

  

(b) Threshold for Stockholders. The Stockholders will have no Liability for
indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 9.2(a)
unless and until the aggregate Damages claimed thereunder exceed an amount
equal to $555,000 (the "Threshold Amount"), and once the aggregate amount of
such Damages under Section 9.2(a) exceeds the Threshold Amount, the Buyer
Indemnified Persons will be entitled to recover all such Damages to which they
are entitled in excess of the Threshold Amount; provided, however, that (i) no
Buyer Indemnified Person shall be entitled to make any claim under Section
9.2(a) in respect of any Individual Matter unless such claim is for Damages in
excess of $25,000 (the "Per Claim Amount"), and (ii) the Threshold Amount and
the Per Claim Amount shall not apply with respect to any Action arising from
the Breach of a Fundamental Representation or from fraud by the Acquired
Entities.

  

  

(c) Limitation for Buyer and the Surviving Corporation. The Buyer's and the
Surviving Corporation's aggregate Liability for indemnification of the
Stockholder Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 9.3(a) shall not exceed
the Maximum Amount; provided, however, that the Maximum Amount shall not apply
with respect to any claim based on fraud by the Buyer or Acquisition Sub or
arising from the breach of a Buyer Fundamental Representation. Notwithstanding
the limitations set forth in the preceding sentence, in no event other than
fraud shall the Buyer's and the Surviving Corporation's aggregate Liability
for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement exceed the Maximum Amount
(other than as set forth in Section 8.3).

  

  

(d) Threshold for Buyer and Acquisition Sub. The Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation will have no Liability for indemnification of the Stockholder
Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 9.3(a) unless and until the aggregate
Damages claimed thereunder exceed an amount equal to the Threshold Amount, and
once the aggregate amount of such Damages under Section 9.3(a) exceeds the
Threshold Amount, the Stockholder Indemnified Persons will be entitled to
recover all such Damages to which they are entitled in excess of the Threshold
Amount; provided, however, that (i) no Stockholder Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to make any claim under Section 9.3(a) in respect of any Individual
Matter unless such claim is for Damages in excess of the Per Claim Amount, and
(ii) the Threshold Amount and the Per Claim Amount shall not apply with
respect to any Action arising from the Breach of a Buyer Fundamental
Representation or from fraud by the Buyer or Acquisition Sub.

  

  

    

9.6

  |  

Exclusive Remedy. Subject to Section 8.3, in the absence of fraud,
indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE IX (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, recovery under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy) shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy for the Parties with respect to all claims
for monetary Damages arising under this Agreement of any kind or nature,
including, without limitation, for any misrepresentation or Breach of any
warranty, covenant, or other provision contained in this Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

9.7

  |  

Special Damages. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHTS THAT IT MAY HAVE TO PUNITIVE, SPECIAL,
TREBLE, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY RELATED AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS OR
ACTIONS OF ANY OF THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY RELATED AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARE PAID OR PAYABLE TO
THIRD PARTIES.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

9.8

  |  

Reduction of Purchase Price. Any indemnification amounts payable by the
Stockholders pursuant to this ARTICLE IX shall be treated for all Tax purposes
to be an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

9.9

  |  

Payment. Absent fraud, the Buyer Indemnified Persons' only recourse for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a), Section 9.2(b), or Section 9.2(c)
shall be to collect (i) first, from and against the Escrow Holdback Amount,
and (ii) thereafter, from and against the Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy. No indemnification claims pursuant to Section 9.2(a),
Section 9.2(b), or Section 9.2(c) shall be brought directly against any
Stockholder and, absent fraud, the Stockholders shall have no Liability beyond
the Escrow Holdback Amount. Any indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE IX
shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the Stockholders' Representative or the Buyer, as the
case may be, within three (3) Business Days after the determination thereof,
whether pursuant to a final judgment, settlement or agreement among the
Parties.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

9.10

  |  

Calculation of Indemnity Payments. The obligation of any Party or Stockholder
to make payments in respect of any claim for indemnification pursuant to this
ARTICLE IX shall be limited to the amount of any Liability that remains after
deducting therefrom (i) any insurance proceeds or any indemnity, contribution
or other similar payment actually received by the Buyer Indemnified Persons
with respect to such claim (net of any increase in premiums related thereto),
(ii) any amounts previously paid by the Stockholders with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 2.4 and (iii) any income Tax savings that are actually
realized by an Indemnitee (or its Affiliates) in the same taxable period as
the event which gave rise to the claim for indemnification occurs as a result
of a Tax deduction or credit directly resulting from such event, treating such
deduction or credit as the last item taken into account in offsetting income
in such period. For purposes of determining whether a representation or
warranty has been Breached and calculating any Damages suffered by the Buyer
Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 9.2(a), each representation or
warranty that contains any qualification as to "materiality" or "Material
Adverse Effect" (other than clause (ii) of Section 3.5) shall be deemed to
have been given as though there were no such qualification.

(b) The Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall prepare and file, or cause
to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by

consistent with each such Acquired Entity's past custom and practice. Buyer
shall provide the Stockholders' Representative with a copy of any Pre-Closing
Tax Return at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the date such Tax
Return is due for the Stockholders' Representative's review. Buyer shall make
revisions to any such Pre-Closing Tax Return as is reasonably requested by the
Stockholders' Representative. In the event there is a disagreement as to
whether revisions requested by the Stockholders' Representative should be
included in any such Tax Return, the disagreement shall be submitted to the
Arbitrating Accountants for resolution (the expenses of which shall be shared
in a manner similarly to that set forth in Section 2.4(c)). Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation shall file all Pre-Closing Tax Returns as finally
prepared (including the resolution of the Arbitrating Accountants, if
applicable).

  

  

(c) The Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall prepare and file, or cause
to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by
each Acquired Entity for any Tax period which begins on or before the Closing
Date and ends after the Closing Date (each such period, a "Straddle Tax

Except as required by Law, all Straddle Period Returns shall be prepared

shall provide the Stockholders' Representative with a copy of any Straddle
Period Return at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the date such Tax

Arbitrating Accountants for resolution (the expenses of which shall be shared
in a manner similarly to that set forth in Section 2.4(c)). Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation shall file all Straddle Period Returns as finally
prepared (including the resolution of the Arbitrating Accountants, if
applicable).

Straddle Tax Period Allocations.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) In the case of a Straddle Tax Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income or receipts or expenses (e.g., payroll Taxes) of the
Acquired Entities for the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date
shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close
of business on the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) The amount of any other Taxes of the Acquired Entities for a Straddle Tax
Period that relates to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Tax
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the taxable period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Tax Period.

  

  

    

10.3

  |  

Elections, Amended Returns, Etc. Without the prior written consent of the
Stockholders' Representative, or as otherwise required by Law, neither the
Buyer nor any Acquired Entity (including a successor to such Acquired Entity)
shall, with respect to any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date (i)
make any Tax election or (ii) file any amended Tax Return or, in the absence
of initial contact by a taxing authority, propose any Tax adjustment for such
period to such authority (e.g., through a voluntary disclosure or similar
program). The Buyer shall not take any action which could prevent the taxable
period beginning prior to the Closing Date from ending on the Closing Date.

10.4

  |  

Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, and the
Stockholders' Representative shall provide, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Acquired Entities to provide, and all Parties shall cause their
Affiliates to provide each other with such assistance as may reasonably be
requested by the others in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return,
any audit or other examination by any Governmental Authority, or any judicial
or administrative proceedings relating to Liabilities for Taxes. Such
assistance shall include making employees reasonably available to provide
additional information or explanation of material provided hereunder and shall
include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns and supporting material. The
party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the assisting party for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing assistance. The Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders' Representative will retain,
and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Acquired Entities to retain, for
the full period of any statute of limitations and provide the others with any
records or information which may be relevant to such preparation, audit,
examination, proceeding or determination.

10.5

  |  

Refunds. Any refunds of Taxes and interest thereon paid by a Governmental
Authority, net of Taxes and costs to the Surviving Corporation, the Acquired
Entities, Buyer or any of their Affiliates related to such refunds and
interest, that relate to a period (or a portion of a period) that ends on or
prior to the Closing Date (excluding any refund attributable to any loss in a
Tax year (or portion of a Straddle Tax Period) beginning after the Closing
Date applied (e.g., as a carryback) to income in a Tax year (or portion of a
Straddle Tax Period) ending on or before the Closing Date) shall be owned by
and delivered to the Stockholders' Representative within 30 days of receipt of
such refund, unless the refund was taken into account in the calculation of
Actual Working Capital. For the avoidance of doubt, any refund attributable to
any loss in a Tax year (or portion of a Straddle Tax Period) ending on or
before the Closing and carried forward against income in a Tax year (or
portion of a Straddle Tax Period) beginning after the Closing shall be owned
by Buyer. In the event that a Tax refund is subsequently determined by any
Governmental Entity to be less than the amount paid by Buyer to the
Stockholders' Representative, the Stockholders' Representative shall promptly
return any such disallowed amounts (plus any interest in respect to such
disallowed Tax refunds owed to a Governmental Entity) to Buyer.
