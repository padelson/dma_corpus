Corporation; and

  



  

(vi) all outstanding shares of Company Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each share of Company Stock that was outstanding immediately

case to be issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.04, without interest,

Section 2.04. _  _ _Surrender and Payment_. (a) Prior to the Effective

with the Exchange Agent for the purpose of exchanging (in each case, other
than Excluded Shares) (i) for the Common Merger Consideration (A)

the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with

entry form representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 2.03(i) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
(ii) for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Series A Preferred
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.04 through the Exchange
Agent, evidence of shares in book-entry

  



  

   

 24

 



    



  

form representing the shares of New Parent Replacement Series A Preferred
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.03(ii) in exchange for outstanding
shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock, and (iii) for the benefit of the

are entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(f) and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to

(3) Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall send, or shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by a Certificate at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal
and instructions (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and

Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent
and which shall otherwise be in customary form and shall include customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" regarding the
book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares) for use in such exchange. All
evidence of shares in book-entry form and cash deposited with the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be referred to in this Agreement as
the "Exchange Fund." Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver the
Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this
Article 2 out of the Exchange Fund in accordance herewith. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided _ that no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the dividends or other
distributions to which holders of Company Common Stock are entitled pursuant
to Section 2.04(f) or cash in lieu of fractional interests to which holders of
Company Common Stock are entitled pursuant to Section 2.07. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and
paid to, Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund.

  



  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, in respect of each share of Company
Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share (A) the
applicable Merger Consideration and (B) any cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends and distributions with respect
thereto as contemplated by Section 2.07 and Section 2.04(f), as applicable).
The shares of Parent Common Stock, New Parent Replacement Series A Preferred
Stock and New Parent Replacement Series B Preferred Stock constituting part of
such Merger Consideration shall, at Parent's option, be in uncertificated
book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is required under Applicable
Law.

  



  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration (or cash in lieu of
any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends and
distributions with respect thereto contemplated by Section 2.07 or Section
2.04(f), as applicable) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated
Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper
form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred
and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent
any transfer or similar Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person
other than the registered

  



  

   

 25

 



    



  

holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such transfer or similar Taxes have
been paid or are not payable.

  



  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock on the records of the
Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger
Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock and any dividends and distributions with respect to the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.07 and Section 2.04(f), as
applicable) with respect thereto in accordance with the procedures set forth
in, or as otherwise contemplated by, this Article 2.

  



  

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Stock twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date shall be delivered to Parent or as otherwise instructed by Parent, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for
the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04
prior to such time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of such
Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto as
contemplated by Section 2.07 and Section 2.04(f), as applicable), without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock
for any amounts properly paid to a public official in compliance with
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock immediately prior to such time
when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) Following the surrender of any Certificates or the transfer of
any Uncertificated Shares as provided in this Section 2.04, and in any event
within two (2) Business Days of such surrender or transfer, the Exchange Agent
shall promptly pay, or cause to be paid, without interest, to the Person in
whose name the shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Common Merger
Consideration have been registered, (i) in connection with the payment of the
Common Merger Consideration, (x) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.07,
as applicable, and (y) the aggregate amount of all dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock with
a record date on or after the Effective Time that were paid prior to the time
of such surrender or transfer, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date after
the payment of the Common Merger Consideration, the amount of all dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to whole shares of Parent Common
Stock constituting the Common Merger Consideration with a record date on or
after the Effective Time and prior to the time of such surrender or transfer
and with a payment date subsequent to the time of such surrender or
transfer. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock constituting the Common Merger Consideration, and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.07, as applicable,
shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any
Uncertificated Shares not transferred until such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as
provided in this Section 2.04.

  



  

   

 26

 



    



  

(g) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred solely by a holder of Company Stock in connection with
the Merger, and the filing of any related Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be the sole responsibility of such
holder.

  



  

Section 2.05. _  _ _Company Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) [Intentionally Omitted]

  



  

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each
restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock
that is outstanding under any Company Stock Plan (other than the Company
Director Deferred RSU Awards) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is eligible to vest solely based on the continued service (each, a
"Company RSU Award"), whether vested or unvested, shall vest (if unvested)
and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Common Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.03, as if such Company RSU Award
(including any shares of Company Common Stock in respect of dividend
equivalent units credited thereon (each such credited share, a "DER")) had
been settled in shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "Company RSU Award Consideration").

  



  

(c) _Company Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units_. At the
Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock that is outstanding under any Company Stock Plan as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time that is eligible to vest based on the
achievement of performance goals (each, a "Company PSU Award"), whether
vested or unvested, shall vest (if unvested) as set forth in the following
sentence and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Common
Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.03, as if such Company PSU
Award (including any DERs credited thereon) had been settled in shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Company
PSU Award Consideration"). With respect to any performance periods that
are completed on or before the Effective Time, a Company PSU Award shall vest
at the greater of the target or actual level of performance, as determined by
the Company's Board of Directors or a committee thereof prior to the Effective
Time. With respect to any performance periods that are not completed on or
before the Effective Time, a Company PSU Award shall vest at the target
level of performance.

  



  

(d) _Company Director Restricted Stock and Deferred Restricted
Stock Units_. At the Effective Time:

  



  

(i) each outstanding restricted stock award made to the Company's
directors with respect to shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Company Director Restricted
Stock Award") shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
Common Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.03.

  



  

(ii) each deferred restricted stock unit award made to the Company's
directors with respect to shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of
immediately prior to

  



  

   

 27

 



    



  

the Effective Time (each, a "Company Director Deferred RSU Award"),
whether vested or unvested, shall vest (if unvested) and be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the Common Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.03, as if such Company Director Deferred RSU Award
(including any DERs credited thereon) had been settled in shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Company Director
Deferred RSU Award Consideration").

  



  

(e) _Delivery of Company Equity Award Consideration; Withholding;
Section 409A_. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay through
the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation (to the extent applicable) to
each holder of a Company Equity Award the Company RSU Award Consideration,
Company PSU Award Consideration, and Company Director Deferred RSU Award
Consideration, as applicable, less any required withholding Taxes and without
interest, no later than the first payroll date of the Surviving
Corporation following the Effective Time; _provided_ , that any such
withholding Taxes required to be paid by or collected on behalf of such
holder shall be satisfied by retaining a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock having a fair market value (determined by reference to the closing
price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date) equal to the
minimum statutory amount required to be withheld. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, with respect to any Company Equity Award that
constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the
Code and that the Company determines prior to the Effective Time is not
eligible to be terminated in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), such payment will be made at the earliest time
permitted under the applicable Company Equity Plan that will not trigger a Tax
or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(f) _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company (and/or the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company) and the Board of Directors of Parent (and/or the
Compensation Management Development and Succession Committee of the Board of
Directors of Parent) shall adopt such resolutions as are necessary to give
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.05.

  



  

Section 2.06. _  _ _Adjustments_. Without limiting or affecting any of
the provisions of Section 6.01 or Section 7.01 (or any corresponding sections
of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, as
applicable), if, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company or Parent shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split), merger,
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar
transaction or event, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during
such period (but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any change that
results from (i) the exercise of stock options or other equity awards to
purchase shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Stock or the settlement of
restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance units of Parent or the
Company or (ii) the grant of equity-based compensation to directors or
employees of Parent or the Company), the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to
eliminate the effect of such event on the Merger Consideration or any such
other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, as applicable.

  



  

Section 2.07. _  _ _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be
issued in the Merger. All fractional shares

  



  

   

 28

 



    



  

of Parent Stock that a holder of shares of Company Stock would otherwise be
entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and, if a
fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled
to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash, without interest, determined
by multiplying the fraction of the applicable share of Parent Stock to which
such holder would otherwise have been entitled by the closing price of such
applicable share of Parent Stock on the NYSE on the last trading day
preceding the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 2.08. _  _ _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision
contained herein to the contrary, but subject to Section __2.05(e), each of
the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any provision of any Applicable Law,
including federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law; _provided_ , however,
that Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide the Company with
written notice prior to any such withholding (other than in the case of any
"backup withholding" pursuant to Section 3406 of the Code and the
corresponding Treasury Regulations) and will reasonably cooperate with the
Company's efforts to reduce or eliminate such withholding. If the
Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so
deducts and withholds any such amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, made such deduction and withholding. The Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall pay, or shall cause to be paid,
all amounts so deducted or withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority
within the period required under Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 2.09. _  _ _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
customary bond issued for a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, in such
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

  



  

Section 2.10. _  _ _Further Assurances_. From and after the Effective
Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments
or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the

without qualification either (x) recommend against such Company Acquisition
Proposal or (y) reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in each case,

public or any request by Parent to do so will be treated as a withdrawal of
the Company Board Recommendation that is adverse to Parent for purposes
hereof), (B) fail to make, or to include in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,

waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to
any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (
_provided_ that if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then (I) the
Company may waive any such standstill or similar agreement to the extent
necessary to permit the Person bound by such provision or agreement to make a
Company Acquisition Proposal to the Board of Directors of the Company and
(II) concurrently with such waiver by the Company, any standstill or similar
provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement shall immediately and
automatically cease to be of any force or effect). Any breach or willful
breach of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section 6.03(a)
by any Subsidiary of the Company or any of its or their
respective Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach or willful breach
(as applicable) of this Section 6.03(a) by the Company.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), if at any time prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (the "Company Approval Time")
(and in no event after the Company Approval Time), the Board of Directors of
the Company receives a _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal made
after the date hereof which has not resulted from a violation of this Section
6.03, the Board of Directors of the Company may, subject to compliance with
this Section 6.03(b), Section 6.03(c) and Section 6.03(e), (i) engage in
negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that, subject to the
Company's compliance with Section 6.03(a), has made after the date of this
Agreement an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel to the Company, constitutes or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Company Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to such Third
Party and its Representatives and financing sources nonpublic information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with terms (including "standstill" or similar terms)
no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, a copy of which shall be provided, promptly after its execution,
to Parent for informational purposes; _provided_ that all such non-public
information (to the extent that such information has not been previously
provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent,
as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it
is provided or made available to such Third Party, and (iii) following
receipt of a Company Superior Proposal after the date of this Agreement, (A)
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (B) terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01(d)(ii) in order to cause the
Company to enter into an Alternate Company Acquisition Agreement with respect
to a Company Superior Proposal (a "Company Superior Proposal
Termination"), but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i)
through (iii) only if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith by majority vote, after consultation with the Company's outside
legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. Nothing
contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from (A)
complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the Securities Exchange Act with regard to
a Company Acquisition Proposal, so long as any action taken or statement made
to so comply is consistent with this Section 6.03 or (B) making any required
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with Applicable Law; _provided_ that any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Company

  



  

   

 84

 



    



  

Acquisition Proposal and/or Company Superior Proposal Termination may only be
made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.03(b), Section
6.03(c) and Section 6.03(e) and, even if permitted by this sentence, shall
have the consequences set forth in this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, issuing a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act shall not be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

  



  

(c) In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 6.03(b),
the Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions
referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 6.03(b), other than
interacting with the Person who made such Company Acquisition Proposal and
its Representatives solely to clarify the terms and conditions
thereof, unless the Company shall have first delivered to Parent written
notice advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action. In
addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of (i) any Company Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any written
request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that, to the knowledge
of the Company or any member of its Board of Directors, is
considering making, is reasonably likely to make or has made, a Company
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided in writing and shall
identify the relevant Third Party and, to the extent known, the material terms
and conditions of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal (including any
material changes thereto). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed,
on a reasonably current basis, of the status and details of any such Company
Acquisition Proposal (including any changes thereto) and shall promptly
(but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) provide to
Parent copies of all material correspondence and written materials sent or
provided to the Company or any of its Affiliates that describes any material
terms or conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal (as well as written
summaries of any material oral communications addressing such matters).

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time prior to the Company Approval Time (and in no event after the
Company Approval Time), the Board of Directors of the Company may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to the occurrence
of a Company Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law; _provided_ that (i) the Company shall (A) promptly notify
Parent in writing of its intention to take such action (which notice shall set
forth in reasonable detail a description of the Company Intervening Event and
the rationale for the Company Adverse Recommendation Change) and
(B) negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to so
negotiate) for five (5) Business Days following such notice regarding
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, and (ii) the
Board of Directors of the Company shall not effect any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Company Intervening Event
unless, after the five (5) Business Day period described in the foregoing
clause (B), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by
majority vote, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and
financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

  



  

   

 85

 



    



  

(e) Without limiting or affecting Section 6.03(a), Section 6.03(b)
or Section 6.03(c), the Board of Directors of the Company shall not make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or effect a Company Superior
Proposal Termination involving or relating to a Company Superior Proposal
unless (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least four (4)
Business Days before taking such action, that the Company intends to take such
action, which notice attaches the most current version of any proposed
agreement or a reasonably detailed summary of all material terms of such
Company Superior Proposal and the identity of the Third Party making such
Company Superior Proposal, (ii) if requested by Parent, during such four (4)
Business Day period, the Company and its Representatives have discussed and
negotiated in good faith with Parent regarding any proposal by Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement in response to such Company Superior
Proposal and (iii) after such four (4) Business Day period, the Board of
Directors of the Company, after discussions with the Company's outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, determines in good faith by majority vote,
taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement, that such Company Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that in the event
of any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of any such
Company Superior Proposal, a new written notification from the Company
consistent with that described in clause (i) of this Section 6.03(e) shall be
required and a new notice period under clause (i) of this Section 6.03(e)
shall commence, during which notice period the Company shall be required to
comply with the requirements of this Section 6.03(e) anew, except that such
new notice period shall be for two (2) Business Days (as opposed to four (4)
Business Days)). After delivery of such written notice pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence until the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Company shall promptly keep Parent informed of
all material developments affecting the material terms of any such Company
Superior Proposal (and the Company shall provide Parent with copies of any
additional written materials received that relate to such Company Superior
Proposal).

  



  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Superior Proposal"
means any _bona fide_ , written, Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a
Company Acquisition Proposal which has resulted from a violation of this
Section 6.03) (with all references to "15%" in the definition of Company
Acquisition Proposal being deemed to be references to "50%" and clauses
(ii)(2), (iii)(2) and (iv)(B)(2) being disregarded) on terms that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by majority vote, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
the Company's outside legal counsel, and taking into account all the
terms and conditions of the Company Acquisition Proposal (including the
identity of the Person making the Company Acquisition Proposal and the
expected timing and likelihood of consummation, any governmental or other
approval requirements (including divestitures and entry into other
commitments and limitations), break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions,
conditions to consummation, availability of necessary financing and all other
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Company Acquisition
Proposal), would result in a transaction (i) that, if consummated, is more
favorable to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than
the Transactions (taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the
terms of this Agreement proposed pursuant to Section 6.03(e)), (ii) that is
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed (taking into
account the identity of the Person making the Company Acquisition Proposal,
any approval requirements and all other financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such Company Acquisition Proposal) and (iii) for which
financing, if a

  



  

   

 86

 



    



   

cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed and
reasonably determined to be available by the Board of Directors of the
Company.

  



  

(g) "Company Intervening Event" means any material event,
circumstance, development, change, occurrence or effect occurring or arising
after the date of this Agreement that (i) was not known or
reasonably foreseeable, or the material consequences of which were not known
or reasonably foreseeable, in each case to the Board of Directors of the
Company as of or prior to the date of this Agreement, and (ii) does not relate
to (A) the receipt, existence, or terms of a Company Acquisition Proposal, or
(B) any event, development, or change in circumstances resulting from a breach
of this Agreement by the Company or any action relating to any Company
Condition Regulatory Approvals or Parent Condition Regulatory Approvals
(including the status thereof) taken pursuant to or in compliance with
Section 8.01; _provided_ that, in any case, in no event shall any of the
following events constitute a Company Intervening Event: (1) any decline, in
and of itself, in the market price or trading volume of Parent Stock, any
changes in credit ratings and any changes in any analysts' recommendations or
ratings with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (but not including,
in each case, the underlying causes thereof); (2) any failure, in and of
itself, by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to meet any internal or published
projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions in respect of revenues,
earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period (but not
including, in each case, the underlying causes thereof); and (3) compliance
with or performance under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  



  

(h) The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and
its Affiliates' respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to
be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with
respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause any such Third Party (and its agents or advisors) in
possession of confidential information about the Company that was furnished
by or on behalf of the Company to such Persons to return or destroy all such
information.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding (i) any Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
(ii) the making of any Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, until termination of this Agreement (including a
Company Superior Proposal Termination), (x) in no event may the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (A) enter into any agreement in principle, letter
of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
instrument constituting or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal (an
"Alternate Company Acquisition Agreement") (other than a confidentiality
agreement in accordance with Section 6.03(b) or an Alternative Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal pursuant to
Section 6.03(b)), (B) except as required by Applicable Law, make, facilitate
or provide information in connection with any SEC or other Filings in
connection with the transactions contemplated by any Company Acquisition
Proposal or (C) seek any Consents in connection with the
transactions contemplated by any Company Acquisition Proposal and (y) the
Company shall otherwise remain subject to all of its obligations under this
Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting; _provided that_ , for the avoidance of doubt,
the Company may effect a Company Superior Proposal Termination pursuant to the
terms of Section 6.03(b), upon which it shall have no obligation to hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting.

timely basis after the Effective Time, and in an effort to accelerate to the
earliest time possible after the Effective Time the realization of synergies,
operating efficiencies and other benefits expected to be realized as a result
of the Merger, upon Parent's request, the parties shall establish a
transition planning team of at least six members (the "Transition
Team") comprised of an equal number of representatives of Parent and the
Company, which shall be responsible for facilitating a transition and
integration planning process to ensure the successful combination of the
operations of Parent and the Company. Upon Parent's request, subject to
Applicable Law, the Transition Team shall be responsible for developing and
implementing a detailed action plan for the combination of the businesses
from and after the Effective Time and shall (i) confer on a regular and
continued basis regarding the status of the transition and integration
planning process, (ii) communicate and consult with its members with
respect to the manner in which the respective businesses will be conducted
from and after the Effective Time and (iii) coordinate human resources
integration.

(A) Parent may implement retention and/or incentive programs for certain
employees of Parent and of Company (which programs, for the avoidance of
doubt, may be implemented in Parent's sole discretion), under which programs
employees of the Company will be considered for participation based on
substantially the same factors and in substantially the same manner as
similarly situated employees of Parent and (B) at the reasonable request of
Parent, the Company shall cooperate in good faith with Parent to establish and
implement Company-sponsored employee retention and transition incentive
programs designed to encourage the retention and performance of employees and
groups of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are mutually
identified by the Company and Parent, and (ii) the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, coordinate with Parent with respect to the
formulation and dissemination of internal and external communications and
announcements relating to the impact on employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries of the Merger and the integration of the operations of the
Company with those of Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the adoption of a retention and transition incentive program
described above in this Section 6.04(b) pursuant to the mutual
written agreement of the Company and Parent, and the obligations and
liabilities relating to such agreed program, shall be disregarded for
purposes of determining the completeness, truthfulness and accuracy of the
representations of the Company set forth in Article 4 and for purposes of
determining the Company's compliance with its covenants under Section 6.01.

  



  

Section 6.05. _  _ _Indenture_. The Company shall timely provide or
cause to be provided, in accordance with the provisions of the Company's

Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Company prior to or at the
Effective Time, as applicable, all funds necessary to satisfy any obligations
of the Company to the holders of the Company Notes that may arise

the extent such costs, fees and expenses are incurred by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the
Company complying with its obligations under this Section 6.05. Parent and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
notice, announcement, certificate or legal opinion referred to in this Section
6.05, in each case, before such document is provided to the trustee under the
Indenture, and such documents shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent. The
Company shall not redeem the Company Notes without the prior written consent
of Parent.

  



  

Section 6.06. _  _ _Advisory Client Consents_.

Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, in accordance
with Applicable Law and the applicable Advisory Agreement, the consent of each
Advisory Client to the deemed assignment of its Advisory Agreement as a
result of the Transactions prior to Closing. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company RIA Subsidiary shall send, within 60 days of
the date hereof, notices complying with all Applicable Laws and
applicable Advisory Agreements to each Person that is an Advisory Client as
of the date hereof (i) informing such Advisory Client of the Transactions,
(ii) informing such Advisory Client that such Company RIA Subsidiary intends
to continue to provide Investment Advisory Services to such Advisory Client

requesting the requisite consent of such Advisory Client to the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the affirmative written
consent of any Advisory Client is required under Applicable Law or Advisory
Agreement in connection with the Transactions (including the deemed
assignment of the Advisory Client's Advisory Agreement), then the Company RIA
Subsidiary, with the cooperation of Parent, shall use reasonable best efforts
to obtain such affirmative written consent prior to Closing. Parent
shall have a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all materials
used to seek Advisory Client consents, or disclose the Transactions to New
Clients, for purposes of this Section 6.06(a) prior to distribution. The

assist the Company and the Company RIA Subsidiary in connection with

information concerning Parent and its Affiliates as is required under
Applicable Law, reasonably required or otherwise reasonably requested in
order for such Company RIA Subsidiary to seek to obtain the approvals and
consents to be sought pursuant to this Section 6.06. Each party shall cause
all information relating to such party and its Affiliates supplied by it for
inclusion in such requests for approvals and consents, at the time of the
mailing or delivery of such requests for approvals and consents or
supplemental communications related thereto, to not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall cause the
sole stockholder of Merger Sub to execute and deliver a written consent
adopting this Agreement in accordance with the Delaware Law and provide a copy
of such written consent to the Company, and thereafter neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall amend, modify or withdraw such consent.

  



  

Section 7.03. _  _ _Director and Officer Liability_. (a) For a period of
six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall (with respect to Parent, only to the

  



  

   

 90

 



    



  

extent that the Surviving Company is permitted to do so under Applicable
Law), jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless and shall advance
expenses as incurred, in each case to the extent (subject to Applicable Law)
such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to the Company Organizational Documents, the governing or
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company and any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof, each present
and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each
case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the "Company Indemnified
Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after
the Effective Time, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, including the Transactions; _provided_ , that in the case of
advancement of expenses, any Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification; _provided_ , _further_ , that such indemnification shall be
subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law.

  



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause to be maintained in effect policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties as such
policies maintained by the Company as of the date hereof with respect to
claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to expend, on an aggregate basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the
current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance (the "Premium Cap"), and if such premiums for such insurance would
at any time exceed the Premium Cap or such coverage is not otherwise
available, then Parent shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance
which, in Parent's good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available at an aggregate premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the
obligations set forth in the foregoing sentence, Parent or the Company may
obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year "tail" policy under
the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the
aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.03 shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any other person, then in
each such case, Parent will cause, to the extent necessary, proper provision
to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, will assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.03.

  



  

Section 7.04. _  _ _Employee Matters_. (a) Section 7.04(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedules sets forth the compensation and benefits that will be
provided for a specified period of time following the Closing by the Surviving
Corporation to the individuals who are employed by the

  



  

   

 91

 



    



  

Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to the
extent they continue as employees of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any
of Parent's Subsidiaries (including Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation)
during all or a portion of the period beginning on the Closing Date through
December 31, 2021 (the "Affected Employees").

  



  

(b) In the event any Affected Employee first becomes eligible to
participate under any Parent Employee Plan following the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to: (i) waive, or cause to be
waived, any preexisting conditions, exclusions, limitations and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
such Affected Employee under any Parent Employee Plan providing medical,
dental or vision benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been
waived or satisfied under the applicable Company Employee Plan such Affected
Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under such Parent
Employee Plan and (ii) provide such Affected Employee with credit for any
copayments and deductibles paid under a Company Employee Plan during the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying such
year's co-payment and deductible limitations under the relevant Parent
Employee Plan in which such Affected Employee is eligible to participate from
and after the Closing Date, to the same extent such credit was given under the
Company Employee Plan such Affected Employee participated in immediately
prior to coverage under such Parent Employee Plan in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent Employee Plan.

  



  

(c) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, recognize all service of each Affected Employee prior to the
Effective Time with the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any respective
predecessors to the extent the Company has provided Parent with all
reasonably necessary records documenting such service with such predecessors)
for all purposes, except for equity compensation vesting purposes, under any
benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries providing benefits to such Affected Employee
after the Effective Time to the same extent such service credit was granted
under any benefit plan or arrangement of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. In no event shall anything contained in this Section 7.04(c)
result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

  



  

(d) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless
otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least five Business Days prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the Company 401(k) Plan. In
connection with the termination of such plan, Parent shall permit each
Affected Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code,
including all participant loans) in cash or notes (in the case of
participant loans) in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution
portion of the account balance distributed to each such Affected Employee
from such plan to an "eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (a "Parent
Qualified Plan"). If the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated as described
herein, the Affected Employees shall be eligible immediately upon the Closing
Date to commence participation in a Parent Qualified Plan.

  



  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the
Company or the appropriate committee thereof shall take all actions
reasonably necessary, including adopting any resolutions or amendments and
providing any notices to participants, (which resolutions,

  



  

   

 92

 



    



  

amendments and notices, if applicable, shall be reasonably satisfactory to
Parent) with respect to the Company's 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"ESPP") to: (i) cause the Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) ongoing as
of the date of this Agreement to be the final Offering Period under the ESPP
and the options under the ESPP to be exercised on the earlier of (x) the
scheduled purchase date for such Offering Period and (y) the date that is
five Business Days prior to the Closing Date (with any participant payroll
deductions not applied to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock
promptly returned to the participant), (ii) prohibit any individual who is not
participating in the ESPP as of the date of this Agreement from commencing
participation in the ESPP following the date of this Agreement, (iii) prohibit
participants in the ESPP from increasing their payroll deductions from those
in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (iv) terminate the ESPP
effective immediately at the end of 6-month period from the date of this
Agreement.

  



  

(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.07, nothing
contained in this Section 7.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement, express or
implied (i) shall cause either Parent or any of its Affiliates to be obligated
to continue to employ any Person, including any Affected Employees, for any
period of time following the Effective Time, (ii) shall prevent Parent or its
Affiliates from revising, amending or terminating any Company Employee Plan or
any other employee benefit plan, program or policy in effect from time to
time, (iii) shall be construed as an amendment of any Company Employee Plan or
Parent Employee Plan, or (iv) shall create any third-party beneficiary rights
in any director, officer, employee or individual Person, including
any present or former employee, officer, director or individual independent
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
beneficiary or dependent of such individual).

  



  

Article 8 _ 
 Covenants of Parent and the Company_

  



  

The parties hereto agree that:

  



  

Section 8.01. _  _ _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts (except where a different efforts standard is
specifically contemplated by this Agreement, in which case, such different
standard shall apply) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective as promptly as practicable the Transactions (including (i) preparing
and filing, as promptly as practicable, with any Governmental Authority or
other Third Party all documentation to effect all necessary Filings (including
Filings pursuant to the HSR Act, which such Filings pursuant to the HSR Act
shall be made within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of
this Agreement) (and, absent the prior written consent of the other party,
not withdrawing any such Filings) and resubmitting any such Filings as soon
as is reasonably practicable in the event such filings are rejected for any
reason whatsoever by the relevant Governmental Authority and (ii) using
reasonable best efforts (except where a different efforts standard is
specifically contemplated by this Agreement, in which case, such different
standard shall apply) to obtain, as promptly as practicable, all Consents
required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority or other Third Party
that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions). To
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Company and Parent shall deliver
as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any

  



  

   

 93

 



    



  

additional information and documentary material that may be requested by any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. Without limiting
the foregoing, none of the Company or Parent or their respective Affiliates
shall extend any waiting period or comparable period under the HSR Act or
other Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with any Governmental
Authority not to consummate the Transactions, except with the prior written
consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law (i) promptly notify the other party of any written
communication made or received by the Company or Parent, as applicable, with
any Governmental Authority relating to Antitrust Law (or any other Filings
made pursuant to this Section 8.01) and regarding this Agreement, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions, and, if permitted by Applicable Law and
reasonably practical, permit the other party to review in advance any
proposed written communication to any such Governmental Authority and
incorporate such other party's (and any of their respective outside
counsel's) reasonable comments to such proposed written communication, (ii)
not agree to participate in any in-person meeting or substantive discussion
with any Governmental Authority in respect of any Filing, investigation or
inquiry relating to Antitrust Law (or any other Filings made pursuant to this
Section 8.01) and regarding this Agreement or any of the Transactions unless,
to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with such other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives
such other party the opportunity to attend or participate, as applicable, and
(iii) promptly furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence,
filings and written communications between it and its Affiliates and
Representatives, on the one hand, and such Governmental Authority or its
respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions. Any materials exchanged in connection with this Section 8.01
may be redacted or withheld as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns, and to remove references concerning the valuation
of the Company or other competitively sensitive material; _provided_ , that
the parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any
materials provided to the other under this Section 8.01 as "outside counsel
only."

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, and in furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to
resolve, avoid, or eliminate impediments or objections, if any, that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions so as
to enable the Merger to occur prior to the End Date; _provided_ that nothing
in this Section 8.01 or anything else in this Agreement shall require Parent,
any of its Affiliates or any of its Subsidiaries to (and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, or shall offer or agree to, do any of the
following without Parent's prior written consent): (i) propose, negotiate,
commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders or otherwise,
the sale, divesture, disposition, or license of any assets,
properties, products, rights, services or businesses of Parent, Parent's
Subsidiaries, Parent's Affiliates, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any interest therein, or agree to any other structural or conduct remedy,
(ii) otherwise take or commit to take any actions that would limit Parent's,
Parent's Subsidiaries, Parent's Affiliates, or the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to
retain any assets, properties, products, rights, services or businesses of
Parent, Parent's Subsidiaries, Parent's Affiliates, or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any interest or interests therein; or (iii) agree to do
any of the foregoing, in each case of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii), except with respect to the wealth management

  



  

   

 94

 



    



  

businesses of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries and only
if such action (A) does not relate to any share plan administration or
corporate services business (including Parent's "Shareworks by Morgan Stanley"
business) and (B) would not otherwise reasonably be expected to materially
and adversely affect the combined wealth management businesses of Parent and
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company), taken as a whole (after
giving effect to the Merger) (any of the actions described in this proviso, a
"Burdensome Condition"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the written
request of Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
agree to take any action that would constitute a Burdensome Condition so long
as such action is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing.

  



  

(d) In the event any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority or
other Third Party is commenced which questions the validity or legality of,
or otherwise challenges, the Transactions, or seeks damages in connection
therewith, Parent and the Company shall, subject to the provisions set forth
in this Section 8.01(d), reasonably cooperate and use reasonable best efforts
to defend against such Proceeding, and if an injunction or other Order is
issued in any such Proceeding, to use reasonable best efforts to have such
injunction or other Order lifted or extinguished, and to cooperate reasonably
regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the Transactions;
_provided_ , that, unless Parent elects to do so, nothing in this Agreement
shall require Parent to commence any litigation against any Governmental
Authority. Parent shall, in consultation with the Company, be entitled to
direct the defense of the Transactions before any Governmental Authority and
to take the lead in the scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any
meetings with, and the conducting of negotiations with, Governmental
Authorities regarding (x) the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period relating to the Merger under the HSR Act, (y) any other
Antitrust Law or (z) obtaining any Parent Governmental Authorization or
Company Governmental Authorization or any other Consent from a Governmental
Authority, so long as Parent's actions in connection therewith are otherwise
in accordance with Parent's obligations under this Section 8.01.

  



  

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event more than 30
days, following the date hereof, the Company shall make all Filings with the
Federal Reserve Board and OCC necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective as promptly as practicable the Transactions.

  



  

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof,
the Company shall cause the Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary to prepare and
submit a FINRA Application consistent with the requirements of FINRA Rule 1017
seeking approval of the change of ownership and control of the Company
Broker-Dealer Subsidiary contemplated by the Transactions and this Agreement.
The Form of the FINRA Application shall be subject to the approval of Parent,
which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Parent shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) timely provide to the Company
all information required to complete the FINRA Application and respond to any
further FINRA requests.

  



  

(g) Parent acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company and the Company Broker-Dealer
Subsidiary shall not be obligated to take any action that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any requirement for a FINRA Application pursuant to
FINRA Rule 1017(a)(5) for approval of any material change in business

  



  

   

 95

 



    



  

operations of the Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby prior to the Closing.

  



  

(h) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof,
the Company shall cause the Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary and each other
Subsidiary of the Company that is a participant in DTC, NSCC, or FICC to
submit to DTCC, on behalf of each of DTC, NSCC and FICC, written notification
regarding the change of ownership and control of the Company Broker-Dealer
Subsidiary and such other Subsidiaries contemplated by the Transactions and
this Agreement (the "DTCC Notifications") consistent with the requirements of
the rules of each of DTC, NSCC and FICC.

  



  

(i) At least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cause the Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary and the FCM
Subsidiary to submit written notification regarding the change of ownership
and control of such entities to any Self-Regulatory Organization of which it
is a member and to each state or other U.S. jurisdiction in which it is
registered to act as a Broker-Dealer (the "Other Regulatory Notifications").

  



  

(j) The Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate with each
other and their respective Representatives in obtaining any other Consents
that may be required in connection with the Transactions; _provided_ that
pursuing the Consents described in Section 6.06 and Section 8.01(a) to
Section 8.01(i) shall be governed by Section 6.06 and Section 8.01(a) to
Section 8.01(i), respectively. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing herein shall obligate or be construed to obligate the
Company or any of its Affiliates or Parent or any of its Affiliates to, and
without Parent's prior written consent neither the Company nor any of its
Affiliates shall, make, or to cause to be made, any payment or other
accommodation to any Third Party in order to obtain the Consent of such Third
Party under any Material Contract.

  



  

Section 8.02. _  _ _Certain Filings; SEC Matters_. (a) As promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent
shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement relating to the
Company Stockholder Meeting (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus") in preliminary form, and (ii)
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form
S-4 which shall include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the "Registration Statement") relating to
the registration of the shares of Parent Stock to be issued to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Parent Share Issuance. The Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and Registration Statement shall comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and
the Securities Exchange Act and other Applicable Law.

  



  

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC as
promptly as practicable after its filing, and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after its filing and keep the
Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary to consummate the
Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after
the receipt thereof, provide the other party with copies of any written
comments and advise the other party of any oral comments with respect to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement received by such
party from the SEC,

  



  

   

 96

 



    



  

including any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement, and shall provide the
other with copies of all material or substantive correspondence between it and
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Registration Statement or
mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or responding to any comments of the
SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall provide the
other party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such document
or response (including the proposed final version of such document or
response) and consider in good faith the comments of the other party in
connection with any such document or response. None of the Company, Parent or
their respective Representatives shall agree to participate in any material or
substantive meeting or conference (including by telephone) with the SEC, or
any member of the staff thereof, in respect of the Registration Statement or
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by the SEC, allows the other party to
participate. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after receipt of notice
thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and the
issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the
qualification of shares of Parent Stock for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take any other action required to be taken by it under the
Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, Delaware Law and the rules of
the NYSE (solely in the case of Parent) and NASDAQ (solely in the case of the
Company) in connection with the filing and distribution of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement, and the solicitation of
proxies from the stockholders of the Company thereunder. Subject to Section
6.03, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the Company Board
Recommendation.

  



  

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do or cause to be done all things,
necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Laws and the rules and
policies of the NYSE and the SEC to enable the listing of the Parent Stock
being registered pursuant to the Registration Statement on the NYSE no later
than the Effective Time, subject to official notice of issuance. Parent shall
also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities
law or "blue sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the Transactions
( _provided_ that in no event shall Parent be required to qualify to do
business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or file
a general consent to service of process). Parent shall also take all actions
necessary or appropriate to ensure that, at Closing, the New Parent
Replacement Series A Preferred Stock and the New Parent Replacement Series B
Preferred Stock will be validly issued and outstanding, including by filing
of any certificates of designation with respect to the New Parent Replacement
Series A Preferred Stock and the New Parent Replacement Series B Preferred
Stock with the Delaware Secretary of State at or prior to Closing.

  



  

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall, upon request, furnish to
the other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and (to the extent reasonably available to the applicable party)
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any statement, Filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, to the SEC, the NYSE or NASDAQ in connection with the
Transactions, including the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. In addition, each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to provide information concerning it necessary to
enable the Company and Parent

  



  

   

 97

 



    



  

to prepare required pro forma financial statements and related footnotes in
connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and/or the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

  



  

(e) If at any time prior to the Company Approval Time, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
either of the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so
that either of such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall promptly be prepared and filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required under Applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

  



  

Section 8.03. _  _ _Company Stockholder Meeting_. (a) Following the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, in consultation with Parent,
set a record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting, which record date shall
be prior to the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and
commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the Securities Exchange
Act in respect thereof at least twenty (20) Business Days prior thereto. As
promptly as practicable following the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, the Company shall, in consultation with Parent, in
accordance with Applicable Law and the Company Organizational Documents, (i)
duly call and give notice of a meeting of the stockholders of the Company
entitled to vote on the Merger (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") at which
meeting the Company shall seek the Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) cause
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (and all other proxy materials for the Company
Stockholder Meeting) to be mailed to its stockholders and (iii) duly convene
and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to Section 6.03, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper
or advisable on its part to cause the Company Stockholder Approval to be
received at the Company Stockholder Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, and shall comply with all legal requirements applicable
to the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, adjourn, postpone or otherwise delay the Company
Stockholder Meeting;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Company may postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting to allow reasonable additional time
for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith after
consultation with outside counsel is necessary under Applicable Law and for
such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
the Company's stockholders prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting. If, on
the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, Parent reasonably determines in
good faith that the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company shall at its election or upon the written
request of Parent adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting until such date as
shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent, which date shall be
not less than five (5) days nor more than ten (10) days after the date of
adjournment, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, shall
continue to use its reasonable best efforts, together with its proxy
solicitor, to assist in the solicitation of proxies from stockholders relating
to the Company Stockholder Approval.

  



  

   

 98

 



    



  

(b) The Company shall coordinate with Parent regarding the record
date and the meeting date for the Company Stockholder Meeting.

  



  

Section 8.04. _  _ _Public Announcements_. The initial press release
concerning this Agreement and the Transactions shall be a joint press release
to be agreed upon by the Company and Parent. Following such initial press
release, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing
any additional press release, making any other public statement or scheduling
any press conference, conference call or meeting with investors or analysts
or making or distributing any broad-based employee communication, in each
case, with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions (collectively, a
"Release") and, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing
agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or association,
shall not issue any such press release, make any such other public statement
or schedule any such press conference, conference call or meeting before such
consultation (and, to the extent applicable, shall reasonably in advance
provide copies of any such press release, statement or agreement (or any
scripts for any conference calls) to the other party and shall consider in
good faith the comments of the other party); _provided_ that the restrictions
set forth in this Section 8.04 shall not apply to any Release (a) made or
proposed to be made by the Company in compliance with Section 6.03 with
respect to the matters contemplated by Section 6.03, (b) if such Release does
not disclose any non-public information regarding the Transactions beyond the
scope of any previously agreed Release to which the other party had been
consulted or (c) in connection with any dispute between the parties regarding
this Agreement or the Transactions.

  



  

Section 8.05. _  _ _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly advise the other of (i) any notice or other material
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Transactions; (ii) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions; (iii) any Proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent and any of its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any Section of this
Agreement or that relate to the consummation of the Transactions; (iv) any

waived (other than those conditions (I) that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, which would have been satisfied at the Closing had
the Closing occurred at the time of such termination, or (II) that have
not been satisfied as a result of a breach of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Sub that was the proximate cause of such condition not having been
satisfied), then Parent shall pay to the Company an amount equal to
$525,000,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee") within two Business Days after
the date of the termination of the Agreement (in the case of any such
termination by the Company) or prior to, and as a condition precedent to, the
termination of the Agreement (in the case of any such termination by Parent).

  



  

(c) Any payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Parent.

  



  

(d) The parties agree and understand that (w) in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, (x) in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Reverse
Termination Fee on more than one occasion, (y) in no event shall Parent be
entitled, pursuant to this Section 10.03, to receive an amount greater than an
amount equal to (A) the Company Termination Fee _plus_ (B) any Collection
Expenses, and (z) in no event shall the Company be entitled, pursuant to this
Section 10.03, to receive an amount greater than an amount equal to (A) the
Reverse Termination Fee  _plus_ (B) any Collection Expenses. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud, (i)
in circumstances where the Company Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination
Fee are payable

  



  

   

 108

 



    



  

or is paid pursuant to this Section 10.03, such payment shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for damages of the Company, Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or further partners,
stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives, as
applicable, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future partners,
stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or Representatives, as applicable,
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Transactions, (ii) if Parent or Merger Sub receive any
payments from the Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement and
thereafter Parent receives the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this
Section 10.03, the amount of such Company Termination Fee shall be reduced by
the aggregate amount of such payments made by the Company prior to paying the
Company Termination Fee in respect of any such breaches and (iii) if the
Company receives any payments from Parent or Merger Sub in respect of any
breach of this Agreement and thereafter the Company receives the Reverse
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 10.03, the amount of such Reverse
Termination Fee shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such payments
made by Parent or Merger Sub prior to paying the Reverse Termination Fee in
respect of any such breaches. The parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this Section 10.03 are an integral part of the Transactions,
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 10.03 do not
constitute a penalty. Accordingly, if any party fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to this Section 10.03, such party shall also pay any
reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) incurred by the party entitled to such payment in connection
with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment for
such amount against the party failing to promptly pay such amount. Any amount
not paid when due pursuant to this Section 10.03 shall bear interest from the
date such amount is due until the date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate
as published in _The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition_ in effect on the
date of such payment (such interest, together with reasonable and documented
costs and expenses of enforcement as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, "Collection Expenses").

Section 11.03. _  _ _Amendments and Waivers_. (a) Any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only
if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by
each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ , that after

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any

Section 11.05. _  _ _Disclosure Schedule References and SEC Document
References_. (a) The parties hereto agree that each section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as
applicable, shall be deemed to be an exception to and to qualify (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of), the corresponding section or
subsection of this Agreement, irrespective of whether or not any particular
section or subsection of this Agreement specifically refers to the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable. The
parties hereto further agree that (other than with respect to any items
disclosed in Section 4.20(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, for which an
explicit reference in any other section shall be required in order to apply
to such other section) disclosure of any item, matter or event in any
particular section or subsection of either the Company Disclosure Schedule or
the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any
other section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, to which the relevance of such disclosure
would be reasonably apparent on its face to a reasonable person without any
independent knowledge regarding the matter(s) so disclosed, notwithstanding
the omission of a cross-reference to such other section or subsections.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto agree that in no event shall any disclosure

Information" or containing a description or explanation of "Forward-Looking

any other provision of this Agreement, no disclosure, representation or
warranty shall be made (or other action taken)

  



  

   

 111

 



    



  

pursuant to this Agreement that results in the disclosure of confidential
supervisory information (including confidential supervisory information as
defined in 12 C.F.R. § 261.2(c) and as identified in 12 C.F.R. § 4.12(b)(8))
of a Governmental Authority by any party to this Agreement to the extent
prohibited by applicable law. To the extent legally permissible, appropriate
substitute disclosures or actions, which may include the disclosure of
underlying facts or circumstances that do not themselves constitute
confidential supervisory information, shall be made or taken under
circumstances in which the limitations of the preceding sentence apply.

  



  

Section 11.07. _  _ _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. (a) The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to
the benefit of the parties hereto, except for: (i) only following the
Effective Time, the right of (x) the Company's stockholders to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration in respect of their shares of Company Stock
pursuant to Section 2.03 and (y) the holders of Company Equity Awards to
receive the applicable Merger Consideration in respect of their Company
Equity Awards pursuant to Section 2.05 and (ii) the right of the Company
Indemnified Parties to enforce the provisions of Section 7.03. Except as
provided in Section 7.03 and in this Section 11.07, no provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations
or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer (by
operation of law or otherwise) any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of each other party hereto, except
that Parent may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to any Person after the
Closing, and Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and obligations
under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to any
other wholly owned direct Subsidiary of Parent, which Subsidiary shall be a
Delaware corporation; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment shall not
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or
change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or Merger
Sub. Any assignment in contravention of the preceding sentence shall be
null and void _ab initio_.

  



  

Section 11.08. _  _ _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions (whether
in contract or tort) based on, arising out of or relating to the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or the Transactions shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the Applicable Law that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of law rules thereof.

  



  

Section 11.09. _  _ _Jurisdiction/Venue_. Each of the parties hereto agrees
that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or
based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the Transactions (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or
against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought, tried and
determined only in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate
court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court
of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto (i)
irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other
process in any suit, action or proceeding relating to the Transactions, on
behalf of itself or its property, in accordance with Section 11.01 or in such
other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, and agrees that nothing in
this Section 11.09 shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process

  



  

   

 112

 



    



  

in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law, (ii) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits itself and its property in any suit,
action or proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware) in any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the Transactions or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect thereof, (iii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (iv) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that
such suit, action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and
agrees not to plead or claim the same and (v) agrees that it shall not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any court other
than the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees
that a final judgment in any suit, action or proceeding in such court as
provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 11.10. _  _ _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.10.

  



  

Section 11.11. _  _ _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be
signed in any number of counterparts, including by e-mail with .pdf
attachments, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed and delivered (by e-mail or otherwise) by all of
the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall
have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication).

  



  

Section 11.12. _  _ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure
Schedule) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

   

 113

 



    



  

Section 11.13. _  _ _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 11.14. _  _ _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and
agree that irreparable harm would occur and that the parties would not have
any adequate remedy at law (even if monetary damages were available) (i) for
any breach of the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that, except where this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 10.01, the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the courts referred to in Section 11.09, without proof of actual
damages, and each party further agrees to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. The parties
further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section
11.14, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other
form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement,
including, subject to Section 10.03(d), monetary damages and (y) nothing
contained in this Section 11.14 shall require any party to institute any
proceeding for (or limit any party's right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance under this Section 11.14 before exercising any
termination right under Section 10.01 or pursuing damages nor shall the
commencement of any action pursuant to this Section 11.14 or anything
contained in this Section 11.14 restrict or limit any party's right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Section 10.01 or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Applicable Law or
inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach or that the
parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.
