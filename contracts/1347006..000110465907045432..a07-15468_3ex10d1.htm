conditions contained in this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer shall assume
and agree to pay and discharge when due, without duplication, the following,
and only the following, Liabilities of Seller arising from operation of the

### (a) All Liabilities accruing after the Closing Date or arising out of, or
relating to, events or occurrences happening after the Closing Date under (i)
the Transferred Contracts listed on _Schedule 3.12(a)_ , (ii) Contracts
related to the Purchased Business that result from bifurcation of Shared

events occurring prior to the Closing Date under any Transferred Contract or
Shared Contract, (y) any Liability under any Transferred Contract or any
Shared Contract to the extent, if any, related to Excluded Assets or Excluded

### (b) All Liabilities arising on or after the Closing Date under any

### (c) Any Environmental, Health and Safety Liabilities related to the Owned

### the extent discharged by Buyer at Closing, any and all pre-payment
penalties and other charges and fees necessary to discharge fully the
Liabilities thereunder (such amount, in the aggregate, the " _Seller Loan
Balance_ "); _provided_ that the Seller Loan Balance shall exclude (x) any
Liability for any Default under any Seller Loan Agreement occurring prior to
the Closing Date and (y) any Indebtedness incurred under any Seller Loan
Agreement in violation of the provisions set forth in _Section 5.2_ ;
_provided_ _further_ , that, with respect to any Seller Loan Agreement (A) in
which Buyer is unable to assume all of the Liabilities of Seller thereunder
(other than those expressly excluded by subclauses (x) and (y) of this
_Section 1.2(d)_ ) for any reason (including, without limitation, as a result
of the non-assignability of such Seller Loan Agreement) or (B) under which
the lender refuses for any reason to release Seller in writing fully from any
and all Liabilities thereunder following the assumption by Buyer of such
Seller Loan Agreement at the Closing, then, with respect to any such Seller
Loan Agreement (each, a " _Non-Assignable Seller Loan Agreement_ "), at the
Closing Buyer shall either (1) pay the principal balance outstanding as of
the Closing Date, together with all interest accrued thereon and any and all
pre-payment penalties and other charges and fees necessary to discharge fully
the Liabilities of Seller under each Non-Assignable Seller Loan Agreement
(such amounts, collectively, the " _Loan Payoff Amount_ "), to the lender
under each Non-Assignable Seller Loan Agreement or (2) in the event that
Buyer is unable for whatever reason to make a direct payment to the lender of
the Loan Payoff Amount at the Closing with respect to any Non-Assignable
Seller Loan Agreement, pay an amount to Seller equal to that portion of the
Seller Loan Balance attributable to such Non-Assignable Seller Loan
Agreements, in which case (I) Seller shall remain solely liable for such Non-
Assignable Seller Loan Agreements and (II) such Non-Assignable Seller Loan
Agreements shall constitute Excluded Liabilities and shall be subject to
indemnification by Seller pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_ ;

  

### (e) Any Assumed Accounts Payable; and

  

### (f) All Liabilities, to the extent arising in connection with the

## 1.3 _Excluded Liabilities_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement and regardless of whether or not any of the following are
reflected in the Purchased Business Financial Statements, except for the
Assumed Liabilities, Buyer shall not assume, or otherwise be responsible for,

## 5.3 _Required Consents and Approvals; Separation of Contracts_.

  

### (a) Each party hereto hereby agrees to cooperate with each other party
and use its Best Efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports, registrations or
other filings and documents and to obtain as promptly as reasonably
practicable all Material Consents.  Each party hereto further agrees to
cooperate with each other party and to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain prior to Closing all other Consents of all third parties and
Governmental Entities mutually agreed to be reasonably necessary or advisable
to consummate the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to cooperate with each other party
in identifying all filings, Consents or approvals that are mutually agreed to
be reasonably necessary or advisable under the HSR Act or other
applicable Antitrust Laws to consummate the Transactions (collectively, the "
_Antitrust Approvals_ "). In carrying out the foregoing obligations, each of
Buyer and Seller shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each of
Buyer and Seller agree that it will keep the other party apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the Transactions, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notice or other communications
received by Buyer, Seller or their respective Affiliates from all third
parties and Governmental Entities with respect to the Transactions
contemplated herein.

  

### (b) Each party agrees to promptly prepare and file the notification,
report form and/or other documentation required to obtain Antitrust Approvals
as agreed between the parties in accordance with _Section 5.3(a)_. To the
extent possible under applicable law and practice, each party hereby
covenants to request early termination of the waiting period required under
the Antitrust Laws of any jurisdiction where Antitrust Approval is sought
(unless otherwise agreed by their legal counsel) and, if and as necessary, to
use Best Efforts to cooperate with the other party to in making any
supplemental presentations to the applicable Governmental Entities and,

       

### if requested by such entities, to promptly amend or furnish additional
information thereunder. Each party shall provide copies to the other party of
the final drafts of all correspondence and filings prior to submission of
such correspondence and filings to the applicable Governmental Entities
in connection with the Transactions and shall provide copies to the other
party of the final correspondence and filings immediately after the
submission or filing of such documents. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing, neither Seller nor Buyer shall be under any obligation to (i)
accept any conditions or modifications imposed or requested by
any Governmental Entity, (ii) propose and/or accept divestitures, or
(iii) initiate or defend any legal action relating to a decision of a
Governmental Entity not to clear and/or approve the Transactions under any
Antitrust Law.

  

### (c) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall use its Best Efforts to
either amend all Shared Contracts and/or assign to Buyer those rights under
such Shared Contracts that are useful or necessary for the Purchased
Business, as reasonably determined by Buyer, without adversely affecting the
rights necessary for the operation of the Retained Business, so that, after
the Closing Date, each Shared Contract shall be equitably apportioned between
the Purchased Business and the Retained Business through such amendment
and/or assignment, including, if commercially practicable, on substantially
the same economic terms as such arrangements exist as of the Closing Date. If
with respect to any Shared Contract, such amendment or assignment cannot be
obtained, or if an attempted amendment or assignment thereof would adversely
affect in a material respect the rights of Seller or Buyer thereunder, Seller
and Buyer shall use their Best Efforts to negotiate a mutually acceptable
arrangement under which (i) Buyer shall obtain the benefits and assume the
obligations under such Shared Contract to the extent related to the Purchased
Business, including entering into sub-contracting, sub-licensing or sub-
leasing arrangements for the benefit of Buyer, or (ii) Seller shall enforce
for the benefit of Buyer, with Buyer assuming Sellers obligations
thereunder, any and all rights of Seller against a third-party to the extent
related to the Purchased Business; provided, however, that following the
expiration or other termination of any such Shared Contract, neither Buyer
nor Seller shall be obligated to continue the foregoing arrangement. For any
Shared Contract that has not been amended or assigned in the manner set forth
in this Section 5.3(c), subject to obtaining the consent of the third party,
(i) Buyer may require Seller to make (and Seller hereby agrees to make) any
changes to any Shared Retained Contract in Buyers sole discretion to the
extent that such changes relate solely to the Purchased Business and do not
adversely affect the rights of Seller thereunder; and (ii) Seller may require
Buyer to make (and Buyer hereby agrees to make) any changes to any Shared
Transferred Contract in Sellers sole discretion to the extent that such
changes relate solely to the Retained Business and do not adversely affect
the rights of Buyer thereunder. For avoidance of doubt, the arrangement
set forth in Schedule 5.3(c) shall be deemed to be a Shared Transferred
Contract.

  

### (d) Each of _Schedules 3.12(a)_ and _3.12(b)_  hereto, Exhibit B to the
form of Commercialization Agreement attached hereto as  _Exhibit B_ and the
related provisions thereof characterize various Contracts listed herein and
therein as Transferred Contracts, Retained Contracts, Shared Retained
Contracts, or Shared Transferred Contracts (as the case may be).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereby agree that, between the
date hereof and the Closing, if Buyer requests a re-characterization of any
of such Contracts, Seller will consider such request in good faith, and, in
the event that the parties cannot reach agreement on such

       

### characterization, the matter will thereafter be submitted to Expedited
Arbitration in accordance with the provisions of _Section 11.12_ hereof.

  

### (e) Seller shall use its Best Efforts to assign, transfer or convey the
Permits to Buyer, as applicable, or if such assignment, transfer or
conveyance of a Permit is not permitted by law or would have a material
adverse effect on the Retained Business, Seller shall provide reasonable
assistance, documentation and other support to Buyer, as reasonably necessary
to enable Buyer to obtain the same benefits, rights and privileges available
to Seller as the holder of such Permit.

  

### (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but
subject to the provisions of _Section 1.2(d)_  with respect to the assignment
of the Seller Loan Agreements, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign any Transferred Contract, Real Property Lease or Permit
related to the Purchased Business or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment thereof,
without the Consent of a third-party thereto, would constitute a Default
thereof or in any way adversely affect the rights of Seller or Buyer
thereunder. If such Consent is not obtained, or if an attempted assignment
thereof would be ineffective or would affect the rights thereunder so that
Buyer would not receive all such rights, Seller will enter into a mutually
acceptable arrangement with Buyer to provide to Buyer the benefits under any
Transferred Contract, Real Property Lease, Permit or any claim or right,
including without limitation enforcement for the benefit of Buyer of any and
all rights of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries against a third-party thereto
arising out of the Default or cancellation by such third-party or otherwise.
Nothing in this _Section 5.3(f)_ shall affect Buyers right to terminate
this Agreement under _Section 10.1_ based on the failure of the condition to
Buyers obligation to close in _Section 6.1(d)_ in the event that any
Material Consent is not obtained.

  

## 5.4 _Notification_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing,
each party will promptly notify the other parties hereto in writing if such
party becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes or constitutes
a breach of any of its representations and warranties as of the date of
this Agreement, or if such party becomes aware of the occurrence after the
date of this Agreement of any fact or condition that would (except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach of any
such representation or warranty had such representation or warranty been made
as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or condition;
provided, however, that such disclosure shall not be deemed to cure any
breach of a representation or warranty. Should any such fact or condition
require any change in the Disclosure Letter if such schedules were dated as
of the date of the occurrence or discovery of any such fact or condition, the
discovering party will promptly deliver to each other party a supplement to
the Disclosure Letter specifying such change; provided, however, that such
supplement shall not be deemed to cure any breach of a representation or
warranty. During the same period, each party to this Agreement will promptly
notify the other parties hereto of the occurrence of any breach of any
covenant or agreement by such party in this Agreement or of the occurrence of
any event that may make the satisfaction of the conditions in Article VI
impossible or unlikely; provided, however, that such disclosure shall not be
deemed to cure any breach of a covenant or agreement or to satisfy a
condition. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other
parties if it becomes aware of a threat or commencement of any Proceeding
before the Closing that either (i) could in any way affect the Purchased
Business or the ability of

       

## such party to consummate the Transactions or (ii) if such Proceeding were
determined adversely to such party, could materially and adversely
affect such party.

  

## 5.5 _No Negotiation_. From the date of this Agreement through the Closing
Date, or unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Article X,
Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or encourage its Affiliates and
Representatives, to directly or indirectly (a) solicit, initiate or encourage
any inquiries or proposals from, (b) negotiate with, or (c) provide any non-
public information to any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates and
Representatives) relating to any transaction involving the sale of all or a
substantial portion of the Purchased Business, whether affected by sale of
assets, sale of equity interests, merger or otherwise. In the event that
Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives receives an unsolicited
inquiry, proposal or offer for such a transaction or obtains information that
any such inquiry, proposal or offer is likely to be made, Seller will (i)
promptly provide Buyer with written notice thereof, including the identity of
the prospective purchaser or soliciting party, (ii) furnish Buyer with a copy
of any proposed response to such purchaser or soliciting party prior to
delivery thereof and (iii) respond to such inquiry, proposal or offer by
indicating, in substance and effect, that Seller is a party to a binding
agreement and referencing its obligations under this Section 5.5.

  

## 5.6 _Best Efforts_. Between the date of this Agreement through the
earlier of the Closing Date or the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article X, each of the parties hereto shall use its Best
Efforts to cause the conditions in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 to be satisfied.

  

## 5.7 _Payment of Liabilities_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, Seller shall pay or otherwise satisfy in the Ordinary Course of
Business all of its Liabilities and obligations related to or incurred in
connection with the Purchased Business (other than Excluded Liabilities). The
parties acknowledge that it may not be practicable to comply or attempt to
comply with the procedures of any bulk sales laws or similar law of any or
all of the states in which the Purchased Assets are situated or of any other
state which may be asserted to be applicable to the Transactions.  The
parties hereby agree to waive compliance with any such laws.

  

## 5.8 _Preparation of Additional Purchased Business Financial Statements_.
In connection with the consummation of the Transactions, Seller shall prepare
and deliver to Buyer, and shall take such steps as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer to obtain the assistance of Sellers independent
accountants, Grant Thornton LLP, in the preparation of, an unaudited balance
sheet of the Purchased Business as of March 31, 2007 and the related
unaudited statements of operations and cash flows for the fiscal quarter
then ended. From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the
Closing Date or the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article X, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer, and shall take such
steps as may be reasonably requested by Buyer to obtain the assistance of
Grant Thornton LLP in the preparation of, unaudited balance sheets of the
Purchased Business as of the last day of each fiscal quarter and the related
unaudited statements of operations and cash flows for such quarterly period
and the year-to-date period then ended.

       

## 5.9 _Proxy Statement_.

  

### (a) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, Seller shall, and
shall use Best Efforts to cause its Representatives and Affiliates to: (i)
furnish to Buyer and its Representatives all of the information regarding
Seller, the Purchased Business, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities (such information, the " _Seller Disclosure Information_ ") that
Buyer may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Proxy
Statement and (ii) cooperate with Buyer and its Representatives and
Affiliates in the preparation of pro forma financial information required to
be included, or reasonably requested by Buyer for inclusion, in the Proxy

Seller of all Seller Disclosure Information, Buyer shall prepare and cause
the Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC.  Buyer shall use Best Efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC.

  

### (b) Buyer shall promptly: (i) notify Seller upon the receipt of any
comments or requests for additional information from the SEC relating to the
Proxy Statements; (ii) promptly respond to any such comments or requests for
additional information following the receipt of any such comments or
requests; and (iii) provide Seller with copies of correspondence between
Buyer and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on
the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Seller shall
promptly furnish to Buyer any Seller Disclosure Information reasonably
requested by Buyer in connection with its response to any such comments.

  

### (c) Prior to the filing or mailing of the Proxy Statement, or responding
to any comments or requests for information from the SEC, Buyer shall provide
Seller with the opportunity to review and comment on any drafts of the Proxy
Statement and related correspondence and filings.

  

### (d) If at any time prior to the Buyer Stockholders Meeting any event
shall occur, or fact or information shall be discovered by Buyer, that is
required to be set forth in an amendment of or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, Buyer shall, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
_Section 5.9_ , prepare and file with the SEC such amendment or supplement as
soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable and cause such amendment or
supplement to be distributed to the stockholders of Buyer if and to the
extent required by any Legal Requirement. Seller agrees to furnish to Buyer
all information concerning Seller and its Affiliates as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing.  If any event
relating to any of Seller Disclosure Information occurs, or if Seller becomes
aware of any Seller Disclosure Information, that should be disclosed in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, then Seller shall promptly
inform Buyer thereof and shall cooperate with Buyer in filing such amendment
or supplement with the SEC.

  

### (e) Buyer shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to Buyers
stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC notifies
Buyer that it has no further comments on the preliminary Proxy Statement.

  

## 5.10 _Buyer Stockholders  Meeting_.

  

### (a) Buyer shall take all action necessary to call, give notice of and
hold a meeting of Buyers stockholders to approve the Transactions (the "
_Buyer Stockholders  _

       

### _Meeting_ "). The Buyer Stockholders Meeting will be held as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Proxy Statement is
mailed to the stockholders of Buyer, consistent with applicable Legal
Requirements.

  

### (b) Subject to _Section 5.10(c)_ : (i) the Proxy Statement shall include

_Buyer Board Recommendation_ "); (ii) the Buyer Board Recommendation shall
not be withdrawn or adversely modified, and (iii) no resolution by the Buyer
Board or any committee thereof to withdraw or adversely modify the Buyer
Board Recommendation shall be adopted or proposed. Buyer shall use Best
Efforts to obtain the Required Buyer Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing shall in any way limit the right of Buyer and the
Buyer Board to comply with their obligations under the Exchange Act or
other applicable Legal Requirements.

  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
5.10(b)_ , at any time prior to obtaining the Required Buyer Stockholder
Approval, the Buyer Board Recommendation may be withdrawn or adversely
modified, if the fairness opinion or the valuation opinion obtained by Buyer
in connection with the Transactions (the " _Buyer Fairness Opinion_ ") is
rescinded, withdrawn or adversely modified

  

## 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

  

### (a) After the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall
extend offers of employment to each Purchased Business Employee listed on
_Schedule 5.11(a)_ , effective from the Closing Date (all such employees who
accept Buyers offer of employment are referred to as the " _Transferring
Employees_ ").  Such offers shall provide for no less than twelve (12)
calendar months of employment with Buyer following the Closing Date, and
while so employed, Buyer shall continue to provide, all of the Transferring
Employees with (i) base salary, bonus and commission structures which are no

the Closing Date, and (ii) a 401(k) matching plan with terms and conditions
(including matching contributions) at least as favorable as Sellers current
plan; and (iii) other employee benefits no less favorable in costs, quality
and substance, on an aggregate basis, to that which they received from Seller
immediately prior to the Closing Date. In addition, Buyer shall provide the
Transferring Employees and their beneficiaries with immediate participation
in a group health plan and shall (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Transferring Employees under any such
plan and (ii) provide each Transferring Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Buyer welfare
plans that Transferring Employees are eligible to participate in after the
Closing Date. **** On and after the Closing, Buyer and any employee benefit
plans maintained by Buyer or its affiliates in which Transferring Employees
participate shall recognize the service of such Transferring Employees with
the Seller for purposes of determining entitlement to vacation and vacation
pay (prorated for a partial year) and for purposes of vesting and eligibility
under any employee benefit plan, but not for purposes of benefit accrual
under any "employee pension benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA. Seller shall terminate the employment of all Transferring Employees

       

### immediately prior to the Closing and shall cooperate with and use their
Best Efforts to assist Buyer in its efforts to secure satisfactory employment
arrangements with those employees of Seller to whom Buyer makes offers of
employment.

  

### (b) Seller shall be liable for, and upon termination of each Transferring
Employees employment with Seller immediately prior to Closing shall pay to
such Transferring Employee, an amount equal to (i) the vacation benefits
accrued by such Transferring Employee through the day immediately prior to
the Closing Date and (ii) all previously unreimbursed expenses incurred by
such Transferring Employee at any time prior to the Closing Date.

  

### (c) Seller shall comply with the requirements of the WARN Act or any
similar state or local law with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass
layoff," as those terms (or similar terms) are defined in the WARN Act or
such other applicable state or local law, which may result from the
termination of employment of any of Sellers employees in connection with the
Transactions through the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of
_Section 1.3(a)_ , Buyer shall not assume any Seller Plan, any Liability
arising in connection with any Seller Plan or any liability arising in
connection with the service relationship between Seller, on the one hand, and
any Purchased Business Employee or any consultant or other service provider
of Seller, on the other hand, which Liabilities shall remain the sole
obligation of Seller. To the extent that any Transferring Employee becomes
entitled to any severance, termination or other payment or benefit
in connection with a termination of employment by Seller, as contemplated by
_Section 5.11(a)_ or otherwise, any such payment or benefit shall be and
remain solely the obligation of Seller, and Buyer shall not assume or incur
any liability in connection with any such termination of employment.

  

### (d) Seller and its ERISA Affiliates shall comply, if applicable, with the
provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended (" _COBRA_ ") with respect to any Purchased Business Employee who is
covered under any Group Health Plan maintained by Seller or its ERISA
Affiliates as of the Closing Date or whose "qualifying event" within the
meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code, occurs on or prior to the Closing
Date, whether pursuant to the provisions of COBRA or otherwise.

  

### (e) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Transferring Employee, any beneficiary or
dependents thereof with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of
employment and benefits that may be provided to any Transferring Employee by
Buyer or under any benefit plan which Buyer may maintain. No provision of this
Agreement shall confer upon any Transferring Employee any right with respect
to continued employment with Buyer or any of its affiliates, nor shall
anything herein interfere with the right of Buyer to terminate the employment
of any Transferring Employee at any time, with or without cause, nor, except
as provided otherwise in Section 5.11(a), restrict Buyer in the exercise of
its independent business judgment in modifying any of the terms and
conditions of employment, compensation and/or employee benefits provided to
Transferring Employees.

  

## 5.12 _Delivery and Objections to Title and Survey_.

  

### (a) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than ten
(10) days after the date hereof, Seller shall request the Title Company to
deliver to Buyer for each of the

       

### Owned Real Properties, (i) a current preliminary title report issued by
the Title Company; and (ii) legible copies of all documents referred to in
each preliminary title report. Buyer shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to obtain, at Buyers sole cost and expense, and approve, a new
or updated ALTA survey of each of the Owned Real Properties to be prepared by
a licensed surveyor or engineer hired by Buyer (the " _Surveys_ "). If Buyer
elects to obtain any such Surveys, then Buyer will cause such Surveys to be
completed within forty (40) days after the date hereof. The documents
referred to in (i) - (ii) of this _Section 5.12(a)_ are collectively referred
to as the " _Title Documents_."

  

### (b) Buyer shall have the right to review the Title Documents and
otherwise examine the condition of the title to each of the Owned Real
Properties during the period which is twenty (20) days following the later of
the date on which (i) the last of the Title Documents have been delivered to
Buyer, or (ii) Buyer has received the last of the updated or new Surveys, as
the case may be (hereinafter referred to as the " _Title Inspection Period_
").

  

### (c) During the Title Inspection Period, Seller shall request the Title
Company to deliver to Buyer an ALTA "extended coverage" supplemental report
or reports for each of the Owned Real Properties covered by the Surveys;
_provided_ Buyer shall pay any additional expense therefor and satisfy any
other Title Company requirements for the issuance thereof.

  

### (d) Subject to _Section 5.12(e)_ , Buyer shall notify Seller in writing
(the " _Title Notice_ ") prior to the expiration of the Title Inspection
Period which exceptions to title (including survey matters), if any, will not
be accepted by Buyer. If Buyer fails to notify Seller in writing of any
exceptions to title for any of the Owned Real Properties by the expiration of
the Title Inspection Period, then Buyer shall be deemed to have approved
the condition of title for such Owned Real Property. If Buyer notifies Seller
in writing that Buyer objects to any exceptions to title, then Seller shall
have five (5) days after receipt of the Title Notice to notify Buyer in
writing (i) that, as a condition to Closing in favor of Buyer, but not as a
covenant of Seller, Seller will remove such objectionable exceptions from
title on or before the Closing; or (ii) that Seller elects not to cause such
exceptions to be removed. Seller may elect either action referred to
in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above in its sole and absolute discretion. If
Seller fails to notify Buyer in writing of its election within said five (5)
day period, Seller shall be deemed to have elected not to cure such
exception. The procurement by Seller of a commitment for the issuance of the
Title Policy or endorsements thereto for each of the Owned Real Properties
satisfactory to Buyer and insuring Buyer against any title exception which
was disapproved pursuant to this _Section 5.12(d)_ shall be deemed a cure by
Seller of such disapproval. If Seller gives Buyer notice under clause (ii)
above, or fails to notify Buyer in writing of its election within said five
(5) day period, then Buyer shall have five (5) days within which to notify
Seller in writing that Buyer will either (x) proceed with the purchase and
take title to the Owned Real Property, subject to such uncured exceptions and
without waiving any right of Buyer to seek indemnification for Sellers
breach of any of its representations or warranties set forth in _Section 3.6_
or elsewhere in this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of _Article
VII_ or (y) terminate this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of
_Article X_. If Buyer fails to notify Seller in writing of its election
within said five (5) day period, then Buyer shall be deemed to have elected
to proceed with the purchase and take title to the Owned Real Property,
subject to such uncured exceptions and without waiving any right of Buyer to
seek indemnification for Sellers breach of any of its representations or

       

### warranties set forth in _Section 3.6_ or elsewhere in this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of _Article VII_.

  

### (e) Whether or not Buyer objects, in accordance with _Section 5.12(d)_ ,
to any title exception consisting of a mortgage lien or any other Encumbrance
which affects any of the Owned Real Properties and that may be removed solely
by the payment of a liquidated sum of money (and the execution and/or
recordation of an appropriate lien release document), including without
limitation any liens for unpaid Taxes then due and payable, Seller shall be
obligated and hereby covenants to satisfy and remove of record or cure, as
the case may be, each of such Encumbrances on or before the Closing Date.
Seller may use all or any portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price to effect
such cure at the Closing. If Seller fails to remove any such Encumbrance
prior to Closing, then Buyer may apply such portion of the Aggregate Purchase
Price as is necessary to cause the removal of such Encumbrance prior to
Closing, in which case the proceeds of the Aggregate Purchase Price to be
otherwise distributed to Seller upon Closing shall be reduced by the amount
so applied.

  

## 5.13 _Pre-Closing "Gap" Title Defects_. Buyer may, at or prior to
Closing, notify Seller in writing (the "Gap Notice") of any objections to
title (a) raised by the Title Company between the expiration of the Title
Inspection Period and the Closing and (b) not disclosed by the Title Company
or otherwise known to Buyer prior to the expiration of the Title Inspection
Period. Buyer must notify Seller of such objection to title within five (5)
days of being made aware of the existence of such exception. If Buyer sends
a Gap Notice to Seller, then Buyer and Seller shall have the same rights and
obligations with respect to such notice as apply to a Title Notice
under Section 5.12.

  

## 5.14 _Conveyance of Title_. At Closing Seller shall convey and transfer
to Buyer the Owned Real Properties, by execution and delivery of a Deed and
such other conveyance documentation as may be required to effectuate such
conveyance and transfer (collectively, the "Real Property Conveyance
Documents"). The form and substance of the Real Property Conveyance Documents
and the sharing of recording fees, escrow fees, title insurance, and Transfer
Taxes, if any, for each Owned Real Property shall be in accordance with the
local custom and practice for the jurisdiction where such Owned Real Property
is located. Within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer
shall submit for Sellers approval the Real Property Conveyance Documents,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. If Buyer and Seller are
unable to agree upon the form and substance of any Real Property Conveyance
Document within six (6) Business Days after the date Seller receives such
Real Property Conveyance Document from Buyer, then either party may submit
such matter for resolution through Expedited Arbitration. The Title Policy
issued by the Title Company shall evidence delivery of title to each Owned
Real Property.

  

## 5.15 _Environmental Assessments_. Buyer shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to obtain, at Buyers sole cost and expense, and approve, a new
Phase 1 environmental assessment for each of the Owned Real Properties and
Leased Real Properties (the "Phase 1 Reports"). If Buyer elects to obtain any
such Phase 1 Reports, then Buyer will cause such Phase 1 Reports to be
prepared and delivered to Buyer within sixty (60) days after the date hereof.
Within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of each such Phase 1 Report,
Buyer shall have the option to either (x) proceed with the purchase and take
title to the Owned Real Property or

       

## Leased Real Property (as the case may be) to which the Phase 1
Report relates, subject to the matters disclosed therein and without waiving
any right of Buyer to seek indemnification for Sellers breach of any of
its representations or warranties set forth in Section 3.14 or elsewhere in
this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Article VII, or
(y) terminate this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Article X.
If Buyer fails to notify Seller in writing of its election within such ten
(10) Business Day period, then Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to
proceed with the purchase and take title to such Owned Real Property or
Leased Real Property (as the case may be), subject to the matters disclosed
in such Phase 1 Report and without waiving any right of Buyer to seek
indemnification for Sellers breach of any of its representations or
warranties set forth in Section 3.14 or elsewhere in this Agreement
in accordance with the provisions of Article VII.

  

## 5.16 _Transition Services Agreement_. Concurrently with the Closing, Buyer
and Seller shall enter into an agreement on terms and conditions
mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the "Transition Services
Agreement"), pursuant to which Seller shall provide Buyer with, and Buyer
shall reimburse Seller for its reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses
in connection with the provision of, the following services for a mutually
agreed upon transition period: (a) human resources and similar types of
employee administrative services with respect to Transferring Employees, (b)
integration services with respect to Buyers information technology and
systems and associated computer programs, products, equipments and services,
(c) solely to the extent that the Closing shall occur on or before the final
National Event of the 2007 NHRA Racing Season, Support Services (as defined
in the Operational Support Agreement) and Sanctioning Services (as defined in
the Sanctioning Agreement), in the manner that such services are contemplated
to be performed pursuant to the terms of the Operational Support Agreement
and the Sanctioning Agreement, respectively, for the remaining National
Events in the 2007 NHRA Racing Season and (d) such other transitional and
integration services as may be set forth therein. If Buyer and Seller are
unable to agree upon the form and substance of the Transition Services
Agreement prior to the Closing, the Closing shall not be delayed solely for
this reason and such dispute shall be submitted for arbitration. For the
period between the Closing and the Arbitrators decision, each party shall in
good faith exercise their Best Efforts to provide the transition services
described in this _Section 5.16_  at cost so that neither the Purchased
Business nor the Retained Business is adversely affected in any material
respects pending the decision of the Arbitrator.

  

## 5.17 _Cooperation with respect to Insurance Obligations_.  From the date
of this Agreement through the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate
in good faith to enter into insurance arrangements on terms and conditions
mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller (including, without limitation, joint
insurance policies entered into by Buyer and Seller) with respect to the
Retained Business and the Purchased Business and the performance by Buyer and
Seller of their respective obligations under the Ongoing Business Agreements
(such arrangement, "Mutual Insurance"). In the event that Buyer and Seller are
unable to obtain Mutual Insurance, at Closing, and as a condition thereof,
Seller and Buyer shall obtain, at the respective partys sole cost and
expense, insurances policies or other forms of insurance evidencing insurance
coverage of the types and in the amounts listed in _Schedule 5.17(a)_ , in
the case of Seller, and _Schedule 5.17(b)_ , in the case of Buyer, each of
which policies and coverages shall name the other party as an additional
insured. In the event that Buyer and/or Seller is unable to obtain such
coverage, at Closing, and as a condition thereof, Buyer and/or Seller shall

       

## have obtained such other equivalent arrangements as shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the other party.

  

## 5.18 _2006 Audited Historical Financial Statements_.  Seller shall use
Best Efforts to deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer as promptly as

audited statements of financial position of Seller as of December 31, 2006

material respects the consolidated financial position of Seller as of such
date and the consolidated changes in net assets and consolidated cash flows
for such fiscal year.

  

## 5.19 _Interim Repairs_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, at Sellers

alleged to have been made by such Person with either Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (or any Person acting (or purportedly acting) on behalf of any
such Person) in connection with the Transactions.

  

### (c) The term " _Damages_ " as used in this _Section 7.2_ is not limited
to matters asserted by third parties against any indemnified party, but
includes Damages incurred or

and expenses of pursuing any claims.

  

### (d) _Notice of Claims_. If a claim for Damages (a " _Claim_ ") is to be
made by a party entitled to indemnification hereunder against
the indemnifying party, the party claiming such indemnification shall, give
written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the indemnifying party as soon as
practicable after the party entitled to indemnification becomes aware of any
fact, condition or event which may give rise to Damages for which
indemnification may be sought under this _Section 7.2_.

  

### (e) _Defense of Third-party Claims_.

  

##### (i) If any lawsuit or enforcement action is filed by a third party
against any party entitled to the benefit of indemnity hereunder with respect
thereto, written notice thereof shall be given to the indemnifying party as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within fifteen (15) calendar days
after the service of the citation or summons). The failure of any
indemnified party to give timely notice hereunder shall not affect rights to
indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the indemnifying party
has been damaged by such failure.  After such notice, if the indemnifying
party shall acknowledge in writing to the indemnified party that the
indemnifying party is obligated under the terms of its indemnity hereunder in
connection with such lawsuit or action, then the indemnifying party shall be
entitled, if it elects to do so, at its own cost, risk and expense, (i) to
take control of the defense and investigation of such lawsuit or action, (ii)
to employ and engage legal counsel of its own choice, but, in any event,
reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party, to handle and defend the same
unless the named parties to such action or proceeding (including any
impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party and the indemnified party has been advised by counsel that there may be
one or more legal defenses available to such indemnified party that are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, in
which event the indemnified party shall be entitled, at the indemnifying
partys cost, risk and expense, to separate counsel of its own choosing.
The indemnifying party shall not, without the written consent of the
indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, (i) settle or compromise any Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment which does not include an unconditional written release by the
claimant or plaintiff of the indemnified party from all Liability in respect
of such Claim, (ii) settle or compromise any Claim if the settlement imposes
equitable remedies or material obligations on the indemnified party other
than financial obligations for which such indemnified party will be
indemnified hereunder or (iii) settle or compromise any Claim if such
settlement or compromise would affect the Tax position or Tax liability of
the indemnified party for any Post-Closing Tax Period. No Claim which is
being defended in good faith by the indemnifying party in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement shall be settled or compromised by the indemnified
party without the written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

##### (ii) If the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such
lawsuit or action within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Claim
Notice, the indemnified party against which such lawsuit or action has been
asserted will (upon

       

##### delivering notice to such effect to the indemnifying party) have the
right to undertake, at the indemnifying partys cost and expense, the
defense, compromise or settlement of such lawsuit or action on behalf of and
for the account and risk of the indemnifying party; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that such lawsuit or action shall not be compromised or settled without the
written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If the indemnified party settles or compromises such
lawsuit or action without the prior written consent of the indemnifying
party, the indemnifying party will bear no Liability hereunder for or with
respect to such lawsuit or action unless the indemnifying party unreasonably
withheld consent.

  

##### (iii) In the event either party assumes the defense of a particular

subject to indemnification under this Agreement in connection with the breach

under insurance coverage (net of the expenses of recovery).

  

##### (viii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein will

rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
any and such rescission rights are hereby waived.

  

##### (ix) In addition to the limitations set forth in _Section 11.17_ and

Damages shall be determined after taking into account any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment received by the indemnified party from
any third-party with respect thereto.

  

## 7.3 _Buyer Trust Account_.

  

### (a) Seller has read a copy of Buyers Registration Statement on Form S-1
(SEC File No. 333-130531), as declared effective by the SEC on June 1, 2006
(the " _Buyer Prospectus_ "). Seller understands that Buyer is a
special purpose company formed for the sole purpose of consummating a
"business combination" and that Buyer has established a trust account at JP
Morgan Chase NY Bank (the " _Trust Account_ "), maintained by American Stock
and Transfer Company acting as trustee, initially in the amount of $142,575,000
and thereafter increased by any earned and accrued interest thereon and
decreased by any applicable state or federal Taxes thereon (collectively, the
" _Trust Assets_ "). Seller acknowledges that the Trust Assets are to be
held for the benefit of Buyers stockholders and either distributed as part
of the consummation of a business combination between Buyer and a business
entity or entities meeting certain requirements or returned to Buyers
stockholders. As of March 31, 2007 Buyer owned liquid assets of approximately
$1,075,000 outside of the Trust Account which it intends to use for its
working capital and other corporate purposes (the " _Non-Trust Assets_ ").

  

### (b) As consideration for Buyers execution of this Agreement, Seller, on
its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and Representatives
(collectively the " _Seller Claimants_ ") hereby agrees that neither it nor
any Seller Claimant will now or at any time in the future have any claim to,
or make any claim against, the Trust Assets or any part of them, whether such
claim arises as a result of Buyers obligations under this Agreement or
Buyers conduct in negotiating or implementing this Agreement or in any other
way that is directly or indirectly related to this Agreement or the
Transactions, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract
or tort or any other theory of Liability (any and all such claims being
collectively refereed to hereafter as " _Transaction Claims_ "). Seller, on
its behalf and on behalf of the Seller Claimants, hereby waives any right it
or they otherwise may have now or hereafter to part or all of the Trust
Assets based upon, or related in any way to, any Transaction Claim and

       

### agrees that it and their sole recourse for any of Transaction Claim shall
be against the Non-Trust Assets unless and until this Agreement is
consummated with Seller.

  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon the
consummation of the Transactions the waiver set forth in _Section 7.3(b)_
shall cease to exist and shall be of no further force and effect, and Seller
shall thereafter have full recourse to the Trust Assets, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Period, as follows:

       

##### (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income or receipts, the portion allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and

  

##### (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or

of any bill for such Taxes related to the Purchased Assets, the party
receiving such bill shall present a statement to the other setting forth the

**** together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the proration amount. The proration amount shall be paid by the

statement.  In the event that Buyer or Seller shall make any payment for
which it is entitled to reimbursement under this _Section 8.3_, the
applicable party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later
than ten (10) days after the presentation of a statement setting forth the
amount of reimbursement to which the presenting party is entitled along with
such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount
of reimbursement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Seller
Indemnified Parties shall be liable for, and Seller shall indemnify and hold
the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from and against (i) any Taxes of

Purchased Business related solely to Excluded Assets other than the
Intellectual Property Assets therein).

  

## 8.5 _Withholding_. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer all
necessary forms and certificates complying with applicable Law, in form

 **ARTICLE IX.**

  

 ** _OTHER POST-CLOSING COVENANTS_**

  

## 9.1 _Post-Closing Access_. Each party hereto agrees that it will
cooperate with and make available to the other party, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, (i) all Books and Records, (ii) information
related to the Purchased Business and (iii) employees (without substantial
disruption of employment), in each case, retained and/or remaining in
existence after the Closing which are necessary or useful in connection
with any Tax inquiry, audit, investigation or dispute, any litigation
or investigation or any other matter requiring any such Books and
Records, information or employees for any reasonable business purpose. The
party requesting any such Books and Records, information or employees shall
bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without
limitation legal fees, but excluding reimbursement for salaries and employee
benefits) reasonably incurred in connection with providing such Books and
Records, information or employees. All information received pursuant to

party in order to comply with applicable Legal Requirements or the rules or
regulations of any securities exchange upon which its securities are traded.

  

## 9.2 _Publicity_. Except (i) as required by Legal Requirement or (ii) in
the case of Buyer, for any filings required to be made with the SEC or AMEX
or other actions that Buyer in good faith determines to be necessary
or appropriate in connection with seeking to obtain the Required Buyer
Stockholder Approval (including in connection with the Proxy Statement),
without prior written approval of Buyer and Seller, none of Buyer, Seller or
their respective Affiliates shall issue any press release or make any public
statement regarding this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby
other than the fact that Buyer acquired the Purchased Business; provided,
however, that nothing set forth in this Section 9.2 shall prohibit the Buyer
Board from exercising its fiduciary duties in its communications to the
stockholders of Buyer. In the case of announcements,
statements, acknowledgments or revelations which either party is required by
Legal Requirement to make, issue or release, the making, issuing or releasing
of any such announcement, statement, acknowledgment or revelation by the
party so required to do so by Legal Requirement shall not constitute a breach
of this Agreement if such party shall have given, to the extent reasonably
practicable, not less than two (2) calendar days prior notice to the other
party, and shall have attempted, to the extent reasonably possible, to clear
such announcement, statement, acknowledgment or revelation with the other
party. Each party hereto agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold any
such consent or clearance. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
parties acknowledge and agree that concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, the parties will issue a mutual press release with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

## 9.3 _Confidential Information_. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree as
follows:

  

### (a) Subject to _Section 9.2_ , the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall continue to be in effect until the Closing, at which time (i)
the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and be of no further effect and
(ii) the conditions set forth in this Section 9.3 shall thereafter apply.

       

### (b) Seller and Buyer acknowledge that the success of the Purchased
Business and the Retained Business after the Closing depends upon the
continued preservation of the confidentiality of certain confidential and
proprietary information related to Seller, the Purchased Business and the
Purchased Assets, and the Retained Business and the Excluded Assets (as the
case may be) in each case, including without limitation technical or
marketing information, ideas, methods, developments,
inventions, improvements, business plans, trade secrets, scientific or
statistical data, diagrams, drawings, specifications or other proprietary
information related thereto, together with all analyses, compilations,
studies or other documents, records or data possessed by Seller and its
Affiliates (" _Confidential Information_ "), that the preservation of the
confidentiality of such Confidential Information by Seller, Buyer and their
respective Affiliates is an essential premise of the bargain between Seller
and Buyer. Accordingly, Seller and Buyer hereby agree that:

  

##### (i) Seller and its Affiliates will not, and Seller will cause its
Affiliates and its Representatives not to, at any time, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Buyer, disclose or use, any
Confidential Information involving or relating to the Purchased Business or
the Purchased Assets, except (A) for any information that prior to the
Closing was primarily used in the Retained Business or (B) to the extent
necessary for Seller to operate and conduct the Retained Business and provide
the services under the Ancillary Agreements following the Closing;

  

##### (ii) Buyer and its Affiliates will not, and Buyer will cause its
Affiliates and its Representatives not to, at any time, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Seller, disclose or use, any
Confidential Information involving or relating to the Retained Business or
the Excluded Assets, except (A) for any information that prior to the Closing
was primarily used in the Purchased Business or (B) to the extent necessary
for Buyer to operate and conduct the Purchased Business following the
Closing; and

  

##### (iii) Buyer and Seller shall each use Best Efforts to maintain the
confidentiality of any Confidential Information involving or relating to the
Retained Business or the Excluded Assets, on the one hand, and the Purchased
Business or the Purchased Assets, on the other hand, from the employees of
the other party due to the close proximity of the location of the employees
of Buyer and Seller following the Closing _._

  

For purposes of this _Section 9.3_ , Confidential Information will not
include any information: (i) generally available to, or known by, the public
(other than as a result of disclosure in violation hereof); (ii) solely with
respect to the Confidential Information of Buyer, that becomes available to
Seller on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Buyer or any
of its Affiliates or Representatives, _provided_ that the source of such
information was not known by Seller, after due inquiry, to be bound by a
confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality to Buyer or any other Person with respect to
such information; or (z) solely with respect to the Confidential Information
of Seller, that becomes available to Buyer on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives,
_provided_ that the source of such information was not known by Buyer, after
due inquiry, to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other
contractual, legal or fiduciary

       

obligation of confidentiality to Seller or any other Person with respect to
such information. Each of Seller and Buyer agree that it will be responsible
for any breach or violation of the provisions of this _Section 9.3(b)_ by
any of its Affiliates or Representatives.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller shall owe no duties to Buyer and have no obligation to maintain
confidentiality with respect to any information relating solely to the
Excluded Assets, the Excluded Liabilities or the Retained Business, and,
following the Closing, Buyer shall owe no duties to Seller and have no
obligation to maintain confidentiality with respect to any information
relating solely to the Purchased Business and the Purchased Assets.

  

### (c) If Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Representatives or
Affiliates is requested or required by Proceeding or Legal Requirement to
disclose any Confidential Information, each party shall provide the other
with prompt written notice of such request or requirement, which notice
shall, if practicable, be at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to making
such disclosure, so that the other party may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of
this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or
the receipt of such a waiver, Seller, Buyer or any of their respective
Representatives or Affiliates are nonetheless, in the opinion of counsel,
legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information, then Seller or Buyer
may disclose that portion of the Confidential Information which such counsel
advises is legally required to be disclosed, _provided_  that such party uses
its reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential
Information in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 9.3_ ,
whereupon such disclosure shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.

  

### (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing nothing set forth in this _Section 9.3_
shall prohibit Buyer from disclosing any Confidential Information to the
extent (i) required by Legal Requirement to be disclosed by Buyer in any
filings required to be made with the SEC or AMEX or (ii) that Buyer in good
faith determines such disclosure to be necessary in connection with
exercising its fiduciary duties in its communications to the stockholders of
Buyer.

  

## 9.4 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing Date, Seller and
Buyer shall take all further actions consistent with the intent of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements necessary (i) to enable Buyer to
operate the Purchased Business in substantially the same manner operated
prior to the Closing Date, (ii) to enable Seller to continue to operate the
Retained Business in the manner contemplated by the Ongoing Business
Agreements, and (iii) upon successful completion of Sellers obligations
under the Ancillary Agreements, to enable Buyer to operate the Purchased
Business on an independent basis, in each case, assuming due performance by
Buyer and Seller of their respective obligations under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.  In furtherance of the foregoing, from time to time
after the Closing Date, the parties hereto agree to (i) furnish upon request
to each other such further assurances, information, documents and instruments
of transfer or assignment and (ii) promptly execute, acknowledge, and deliver
any such further assurances, documents and instruments of transfer or
assignment, in each case that the other party may reasonably request for the
purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, including without limitation to transfer and assign to Buyer
those assets of Seller used or held for use in the conduct of the Purchased
Business to the extent not otherwise transferred hereby or thereby.
As promptly as possible after the Closing Date, Seller shall make any
filings and/or give any notices required by applicable Legal Requirements to
be made or given by them in order to consummate the

       

## Transactions that were not made or given prior to the Closing,
shall obtain all other required Consents not obtained prior to the Closing,
and shall use their Best Effort to apportion any Shared Contract not
apportioned prior to the Closing; provided that neither Buyer nor Seller
shall be required to make any payments, commence litigation or agree to any
modification to the terms of any Contract in order to obtain any such Consent
or apportion any Shared Contract. To the extent that the inclusion within
the Purchased Assets of any of (i) Sellers right, title and interest in and
to the business, properties, assets and rights of any kind, whether tangible
or intangible, real or personal, primarily related to or primarily used in
connection with the Purchased Business (but excluding therefrom the Excluded
Assets) would have resulted in the cancellation, invalidity or termination of
such rights or (ii) the portion of Sellers right, title and interest in and
to all Shared Assets that relates to the Purchased Business to the extent
that such portion of the Shared Assets or the benefits thereof would have
resulted in the cancellation, invalidity or termination of such Shared
Assets, then in each case, if and when such inclusion would no longer result
in such cancellation, invalidity or termination, then Seller shall take all
actions necessary to effectuate such inclusion and assignment of all of
Sellers right, title and interest therein to Buyer.

  

## 9.5 _Assigned Accounts Receivable; Quarterly Adjustments_.

  

### (a) At the Closing, Buyer will acquire hereunder, and thereafter Buyer or
its designee shall have the right and authority to collect for Buyers

### (b) From and after the Closing Date until the first anniversary thereof,

payments have been paid or received by Seller with respect to the Assumed
Accounts Payable or Assigned Accounts Receivable (as applicable) and whether
any payments have been paid or received by Buyer with respect to any Accounts
Payable other than the Assumed Accounts Payable or with respect to any
Accounts Receivable other than the Assigned Accounts Receivable (as
applicable), and Buyer or Seller (as the case may be) shall
thereafter promptly make any payments required to be made to the other party
in respect of any of the foregoing in order to ensure that the parties have
given effect to the assignment and assumption by Buyer of the Assigned
Accounts Receivable and the Assumed Accounts Payable and the retention by
Seller of the other Accounts Receivable and the other Accounts Payable,
hereunder.

that includes footage of any Top Fuel or Fuel Funny Car Exhibition.

  

### (c) Except as otherwise set forth in Sections 9.8(a) and (b) above, with
respect to all other classes of vehicles, Buyer may Conduct such Exhibition
and/or Promotional activities without restriction and Seller may Conduct or
such Exhibition and/or Promotional activities at any Association Drag Racing
event.

  

## 9.9 _Equitable Relief_. Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledges that the
terms, conditions and restrictions in Sections 9.6, 9.7 and 9.8 above are
reasonable and necessary in order to protect and maintain the goodwill,
proprietary and other legitimate business interests of the Purchased Business
and the Retained Business. Each of Buyer and Seller further agrees that the
actual or Threatened breach by Buyer and/or Seller of such covenants
would cause immediate, substantial, and irreparable harm to the other party,
for which the full extent of resulting injury would be impossible to
calculate, and Buyer and/or Seller therefore will not have an adequate remedy

breach, without bond or security, which is hereby waived by each of Buyer and
Seller to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.

that such illegal, overly broad, or otherwise unenforceable portion(s) shall
be amended (by blue-penciling or otherwise) or, if blue-penciling or similar
procedures are not available, limited or excluded from Sections 9.6, 9.7, 9.8
or 9.9, as applicable and as necessary, so that the remaining provisions of
Sections 9.6, 9.7, 9.8 or 9.9, as applicable, shall be enforceable in
accordance with their terms.

  

## 9.11 _Buyer Employee Non-Solicitation_. During the period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly,
solicit any employee of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer, including any

terminate or limit his or her business relationship with Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer.
