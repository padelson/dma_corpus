ARTICLE I.

THE CLOSING; PURCHASE AND SALE OF HOUSECALL STOCK



_Section 1.1 _Purchase and Sale of Stock and Options_ _



At the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
_Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ below, as applicable, the Purchaser shall purchase
from the Sellers and the Sellers shall sell, convey, assign, transfer, and
deliver to the Purchaser, all of the Housecall Stock, free from Liens.



_Section 1.2 _Purchase Price_ _



The purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for the Housecall Stock shall be
$106,400,000 (i) plus or minus, as the case may be, the estimated adjustment
that is provided for in _Section 1.5_ , and (ii) minus the amount of all
Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary existing on the Closing Date
other than any such Indebtedness that either (A) will be a short-term
liability on the Closing Balance Sheet, or (B) will be paid out of the
Purchase Price at the Closing in accordance with _Section 1.4(a)(ii)_. The
Purchase Price shall be paid by the Purchaser as described in _Section 1.4_
below. The Purchase Price is subject to post-Closing adjustment, pursuant to
_Section 1.6_ below.



 

\- 1 - _Section 1.3 _The Closing_ _



(a) The closing of the purchase and sale of the Housecall Stock (the "Sale"),
and the transactions relating thereto (collectively, the "Closing") shall
take place at the offices of Correro Fishman Haygood Phelps Walmsley and
Casteix, L.L.P., 201 St. Charles Avenue, 46th Floor, New Orleans, LA
70170-4600 (or at such other location as the Parties may agree), commencing

seventh Business Day following the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing
that are set forth in _Sections 7.1(f)_ and _7.2(e)_. The date and time of the
Closing are referred to as the "Closing Date." Purchaser Entities may
unilaterally delay the Closing Date as necessary to accord Purchaser Entities
the full 10 Business Days referred to in _Section 5.4_.



(b) In addition to the Closing deliveries provided for elsewhere in this
Agreement, the following shall also be delivered at Closing: (i) by Sellers
and Purchaser, an escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") among Purchaser,
Sellers and an escrow agent identified therein (the "Escrow Agent"), in the
form of _Schedule 1.3(b)(i)_ and duly executed by Sellers and Purchaser; (ii)
by Sellers, a noncompetition and confidentiality agreement (the
"Noncompetition Agreement") between the Company and each of the persons listed
on _Schedule 1.3(b)(ii)-A_ , in the form of _Schedule 1.3(b)(ii)-B_ and duly
executed by each such person; (iii) by Sellers, an employment agreement (the

_Section 1.4 _Payment of the Purchase Price_ _



At the Closing, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions specified in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ below:



(a) The Purchaser will pay the Purchase Price as follows:



(i) $10,640,000 will be paid to the Escrow Agent, to be held pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement;



(ii) Any amount of the Purchase Price that is designated by the StockholdersÂ’
Representative at least three Business Days prior to the Closing to be applied
to Indebtedness of the Company shall be paid as so designated;



(iii) The remainder of the Purchase Price, after deducting the payments in
accordance with (i) and (ii) above and after deducting any payment made by
Purchaser of Seller Commitments listed on _Schedule 5.12-B_ , shall be paid as
follows: (A) 85.51% (which percentage represents the number of shares of
Common Stock of the Stockholders, divided by such number of shares plus the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Options) to the
Stockholders in the proportions shown on _Schedule 1.4(a)(iii)(A)_ , which
proportions represent the proportionate ownership of Common Stock prior
to the  



 

\- 2 -  exercise of the Options, and (B) the remaining 14.49% (which percentage
represents the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the
Options divided by the sum of such number of shares plus the number of shares
of Common Stock held by the Stockholders) to the Option Holders in the
proportions shown on _Schedule 1.4(a)(iii)(B)_ , which proportions represent
the number of shares to which each Option Holder is entitled upon exercise of
the Options divided by the total number to which all are entitled upon such
exercise. Purchaser shall deduct from the amount payable under clause (B) the
aggregate amount of employee tax withholding that is applicable to the Option
Holders with respect to the exercise of the Options, and shall pay such amount
to the Company. The amount payable to each Option Holder under clause (B)
shall in turn be reduced by the amount of such withholding (if any)
applicable to that Option Holder.



All payments to be made in accordance with _Section 1.4(a)_ shall, to the
extent wire transfer instructions have been delivered to Purchaser not less
than three Business Days prior to the Closing, be made in accordance with
those instructions by wire transfer of immediately available funds. All
payments not made by wire transfer in accordance with the preceding sentence
shall be made by an official bank check drawn on a federal reserve bank.



(b) The Stockholders and Option Holders shall deliver to the Purchaser
the stock certificates and option and warrant agreements representing 100% of
the Housecall Stock, on a fully diluted basis, endorsed in blank or
accompanied by duly executed assignment documents and with signature
guaranteed.



_Section 1.5 _Estimated Adjustment_ _



(a) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company
shall deliver its best estimate of the Closing Balance Sheet (the "Estimated
Balance Sheet") and a calculation from that Estimated Balance Sheet of the
estimated Net Working Capital as of the Effective Date (the "Estimated Net
Working Capital"), determined in accordance with the definition of Net
Working Capital in _Article VIII_ and in accordance with the principles
established by _Section 1.6_ , except that such Estimated Balance Sheet and
the Estimated Net Working Capital shall not be subject to the dispute
resolution procedures of _Section 1.6_.



(b) The estimated adjustment that is referred to in clause (i) of _Section
1.2_ is the following:



(i) If the Estimated Net Working Capital is equal to the Target Net
Working Capital, there shall be no adjustment pursuant to clause (i) of
_Section 1.2_ ;



(ii) If the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working
Capital, then the amount of such excess is the adjustment pursuant to clause
(i) of _Section 1.2_ , and it is a positive adjustment (that is, it is added
in calculating the Purchase Price); and



 

\- 3 - (iii) If the Target Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working
Capital, then the amount of such excess is the adjustment pursuant to clause
(i) of _Section 1.2_ , and it is a negative adjustment (that is, it is
subtracted in calculating the Purchase Price).



_Section 1.6 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_ _



Following the Closing Date, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as set forth
below:



(a) The Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers within 60
days after the last day of the month in which Closing occurs, an unaudited
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business
on the Effective Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and a calculation of Net
Working Capital determined from the Closing Balance Sheet (the "Net Working
Capital Calculation") and adjusted in accordance with the definition of Net
Working Capital in _Article VIII_ and the provisions of _Section 1.6_ and 
_5.16_. The Closing Balance Sheet and the Net Working Capital Calculation
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the application of the
accounting principles applied in the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet
(but not inconsistent with GAAP), and all appropriate adjustments shall be
made without regard to whether any such adjustment is or is not material.



(b) On or prior to the 30th day following the PurchaserÂ’s delivery of the
Closing Balance Sheet, the StockholdersÂ’ Representative may give
the Purchaser a written notice stating in reasonable detail the SellersÂ’
objections (an "Objection Notice") to the Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Net
Working Capital Calculation. Any Objection Notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the dollar amount of any objection and the basis therefor. Any
determination set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet or the Net Working
Capital Calculation that is not specifically objected to in the Objection
Notice and which is not affected by the Objection Notice shall be deemed
acceptable and shall be final and binding upon the Parties upon delivery of
the Objection Notice. If the StockholdersÂ’ Representative does not give the
Purchaser an Objection Notice within such 30-day period, then the Closing
Balance Sheet will be conclusive and binding upon the Parties and the Net
Working Capital Calculation will constitute the Net Working Capital
Calculation for purposes of _Section 1.6(a)_ above.



(c) Following the PurchaserÂ’s receipt of any Objection Notice,
the StockholdersÂ’ Representative and the Purchaser shall attempt to negotiate
in good faith to resolve such dispute. In the event that the StockholdersÂ’
Representative and the Purchaser fail to agree on any of the proposed
adjustments set forth in the Objection Notice within 30 days after the
Purchaser receives the Objection Notice, the Sellers and the Purchaser agree
that a mutually acceptable accounting firm of nationally recognized standing
(the "Independent Auditors") shall, within the 30-day period immediately
following such failure to agree, make the final determination of the Net
Working Capital in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Purchaser
and the StockholdersÂ’ Representative each shall provide the Independent
Auditors with their respective determinations of the Net Working Capital
Calculation. The Independent Auditors shall make an independent determination
of the Net Working Capital that shall be final and binding on the Sellers and
the Purchaser if such independent determination shall be within the range
proposed by the Purchaser and the Sellers in the Net Working Capital
Calculation and the Objection Notice. If the Independent AuditorsÂ’
determination of the Net Working Capital is outside of the  



 

\- 4 -  range proposed by the StockholdersÂ’ Representative and the Purchaser in the
Net Working Capital Calculation and the Objection Notice, then the
Net Working Capital Calculation of the party whose Net Working Capital
Calculation was closer to that of the Independent Auditors shall be final and
binding on the Sellers and the Purchaser. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Auditors shall be split equally between Purchaser, on the one
hand, and Sellers, on the other, except that if the Independent AuditorsÂ’
determination of the Net Working Capital is outside of the range proposed by
the Sellers and the Purchaser, then such fees, costs and expenses will be
paid by the party whose Net Working Capital Calculation was different by the
greater amount from that of the Independent Auditors.



(d) The terms "Closing Balance Sheet" and "Net Working Capital" shall mean the
Closing Balance Sheet and Net Working Capital Calculation delivered pursuant
to _Section 1.6(a)_ as adjusted pursuant to _Sections 1.6(b)_ and _(c)_. The
date on which the Closing Balance Sheet and Net Working Capital are finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ is referred to as the "Settlement
Date."



(e) If the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital
Calculation, then the Sellers shall deliver to the Purchaser by wire transfer
of immediately available funds an amount equal to the amount of such excess.
If the Net Working Capital Calculation exceeds the Estimated Net Working
Capital, then the Purchaser shall pay 10% of such excess to the Escrow Agent
and shall pay to the Sellers, in the same proportions as the payments under
_Section 1.4 (a)(iii)_ and comparably reduced by any withholding obligations
of the type referred to in _Section 1.4(a)(iii)_ , by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, 90% of the amount by which the Net Working
Capital Calculation exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital. All payments
pursuant to this _Section 1.6(e)_ shall bear interest from the Closing Date
until paid, at a floating rate of interest equal to the prime rate reflected
from time to time during that period in the Money Rates section of _The
Wall Street Journal_.



(f) _Schedule 1.6(f)_ provides an example of the calculation of Net Working
Capital as of the Effective Date.



(g) The Parties acknowledge that the effect of calculating the Net Working
Capital as of the Effective Date rather than as of the Closing Date is that
changes in current assets and current liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Date will, if the Closing occurs, have
been for the account of the Purchaser Entities and not of the Sellers.
Consequently, and without limiting any other restrictions contained in this
Agreement, the Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, make
any payment of any kind to Sellers following the Effective Date other than (i)
payments that are required by contracts listed on the Contracts Schedule and
payments of salaries and benefits at rates currently in effect, and (ii)
other payments that will appear as current liabilities (without corresponding
current assets) on the Closing Balance Sheet. In addition, all accruals that
occur by reason of the Closing, such as the payment of severance and change-
in-control benefits (other than such accruals related to amounts that
Purchaser Entities have agreed to pay in accordance with this Agreement),
shall for purposes of calculating Net Working Capital, and Delta Earnings or
Delta Losses in accordance with _Section 1.6(h)_ , be deemed to have occurred
as of the Effective Date. The Parties agree to make all similar adjustments
that are required so that when the Closing occurs, the Parties will to the
maximum possible extent be in the position in which they would have been had
the Closing Date and Effective Date both occurred on the Effective Date.



 

\- 5 - (h) If the Closing occurs after July 12, 2005, the Purchase Price will be
further adjusted in accordance with the following: (i) The Purchase Price
shall be increased by the Delta Earnings or reduced by the Delta Losses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the period beginning the day following the
Effective Date and ending at the close of business on the Closing Date
("Delta Period"); and (ii) if _Section 1.6(h)_ is applicable, a statement of
Delta Earnings or Delta Losses, as applicable, for the Delta Period will be
prepared, delivered, reviewed, and determined according to the same time
schedule and process as is applicable to the preparation, delivery, review and
determination of Net Working Capital, _mutatis mutandis_. If the Closing
occurs on or before July 11, 2005, this _Section 1.6(h)_ is of no effect.

Control Unit or other administrative, enforcement or prosecutorial authority,
related to health care fraud, abuse or other misconduct, including (without
limitation) overbilling, kickbacks, Stark violations, HIPAA violations, or
violations of the Medicare Conditions of Participation (the matters referred
to in this clause (8) are collectively the "Governmental Recoveries").



(b) The foregoing indemnification provisions shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy and procedure for all claims for breach of any representation or
warranty or covenant contained herein or in any of the Schedules or Exhibits
attached hereto, except (i) as provided in Section _9.2(c)_ and (ii) that all
remedies available at law or in equity shall be available with respect to a
claim by the Purchaser for fraud or willful misconduct by Sellers (or any
of them), the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in which event none of the limitations
provided by _Section 6.1_ or _6.4_ shall apply except that the aggregate
limitation of liability shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the Adjusted
Purchase Price.



(c) In calculating the amount of Losses suffered or incurred by a Purchaser
Indemnitee for which indemnification is sought hereunder, there shall be
deducted the amount of any actual recovery by such Purchaser Indemnitee, net
of the expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by any such
Purchaser Indemnitee in connection with such recovery, from (i) occurrence-
based insurance policies maintained by the Company at any time prior to the
Closing, and (ii) claims-made-based insurance policies maintained by the
Company at any time following the Closing but only to the extent that such
recovery would also have been available under claims-made policies maintained
by the Company immediately prior to the Closing, as if the Loss had occurred
immediately prior to the Closing, taking into account all relevant provisions
of such policies maintained prior to the Closing, including deductible,
retention and policy limits. Neither the Company nor any other Purchaser
Indemnitee shall be obligated hereby to maintain insurance coverages or to
pursue any such insurance recovery, but shall notify Sellers of any
determination not to pursue recovery (and, in the case of clause (ii) only, of
the existence of policies that reasonably might provide coverage for the
indemnifiable Loss), in which event Sellers shall be entitled to pursue such
claim on behalf of the Company at the sole risk and expense of Sellers with
respect to any retroactive premium adjustment that is permitted by the  



 

\- 34 -  applicable policy (but only to the extent attributable to such claim pursued
by Sellers), the costs and expenses (including attorneyÂ’s fees) of
pursuing such claim, and claims and Liabilities (including attorneyÂ’s fees)
resulting from any counterclaims or demands by the parties to such litigation
(which risk and expense shall not be deemed indemnification paid under
_Article VI_ ). Notwithstanding anything hereinabove to the contrary, in any
policy period, if all claims made by the Sellers and the Purchaser (and
PurchaserÂ’s Affiliates) cause the aggregate coverage limits of any of such
policies to be exceeded, then the Sellers shall return to the Purchaser
promptly upon demand therefor the lesser of (1) such excess, or (2) the amount
of insurance proceeds recovered by Sellers from their claim or by the
Purchaser Indemnitee in SellersÂ’ behalf.



_Section 6.5 _Indemnification Procedures_ _



(a) _Notice of Claim_. Any Person making a claim for indemnification pursuant
to _Section 6.2_ or _6.3_ above (an "Indemnified Party") must give the party
from whom indemnification is sought (an "Indemnifying Party") written notice
of such claim (an "Indemnification Claim Notice") promptly after the
Indemnified Party receives any written notice of any action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation or other claim (a "Proceeding") against or involving
the Indemnified Party by a Government Entity or other third Person (a "third
party claim") or otherwise discovers the liability, obligation or facts giving
rise to such claim for indemnification (it being understood that any claim for
indemnity pursuant to _Sections 6.2(a)(ii)_ ,  _6.2(b)(i)_ or _6.3(b)_ above
must be made by written notice given within the applicable survival period
specified in _Section 6.1_ above). Such notice must contain a description of
the claim and the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent that the
nature and amount of such Loss is known at such time). Failure to give or
delay in giving notice shall not excuse the Indemnifying Party from liability
for indemnification except to any extent to which the Indemnifying Party
is actually prejudiced by such failure or delay or if the Indemnification
Claim Notice is delivered after the time specified in _Section 6.1_.



(b) _Control of Defense; Conditions_. The obligations of an Indemnifying Party
under this _Article VI_ with respect to Losses arising from any third party
claims that are subject to the indemnification provided in _Section 6.2_ or
_6.3_ above shall be governed by the following additional terms and
conditions:



(i) At its option an Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume control of
the defense of any claim and may appoint as lead counsel of such defense any
legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party.



(ii) Notwithstanding _Section 6.5(b)(i)_ above, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of
its choice for such purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that such employment
shall be at the Indemnified PartyÂ’s own expense unless (A) the employment
thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party
in writing, or (B) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense
and employ counsel (following written notice from the Indemnified Party), in
which case the fees and expenses of the Indemnified PartyÂ’s counsel shall be
paid by the Indemnifying Party.



 

\- 35 - (iii) The Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to any third party claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld
unreasonably). The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any third party claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not
to be withheld unreasonably) unless such judgment or settlement contains an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and does not impose
any obligations on it other than monetary obligations that are being fully
discharged simultaneously by the Indemnifying Party.



(c) _Manner of Payment._



(i) Any indemnification obligations of the Sellers pursuant to _Section 6.2_
shall be paid promptly by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an
account designed in writing by the applicable Purchaser Indemnitees, within 15
days after the determination thereof.



(ii) Any indemnification obligations of the Purchaser pursuant to _Section
6.3_ shall be paid promptly by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
to an account designated in writing by the applicable Seller Indemnitees,
within 15 days after the determination thereof.



_Section 6.6 _Miscellaneous Indemnification Provisions_ _



(a) Indemnification payments from a Seller to a Purchaser Indemnitee shall be
deemed a reduction in the Purchase Price.



(b) In order to secure the payment of any amounts due under _Section 6.2_ ,
Sellers hereby pledge and assign unto the Purchaser Entities and the other
Purchaser Indemnitees the entire interest of Sellers in and to the escrow fund
that is held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement from time to time,
it being intended that Purchaser and such other Purchaser Indemnitees shall
have a first Lien with respect to the escrow fund in preference and priority
over all other creditors of Sellers or any of them.



(c) Purchaser and Sellers shall, within 30 days following the first,
second and third anniversaries of the Closing Date, jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to distribute to StockholdersÂ’ Representative an amount equal to
(i) one-third of the escrow fund, with respect to the first anniversary, (ii)
one-half of the escrow fund, with respect to the second anniversary, and
(iii) the entire escrow fund, with respect to the third anniversary, in each
case reduced by (A) the amount of pending claims on such anniversary, as
reasonably estimated by Purchaser, and (B) the amount of claims paid from the
escrow fund since the Closing Date, in the case of the first anniversary, or
since the previous anniversary, in the case of each subsequent anniversary.
The excess (if any) of the amount withheld to cover a pending claim shall be
paid out upon resolution, including payment in full, of that claim, except to
the extent such excess may be needed to cover a deficiency in the amount
withheld to cover any other pending claim. Purchaser and Sellers shall
issue written instructions to the Escrow Agent as necessary to cause the
provisions of this _Section 6.6(c)_ to be implemented.



 

\- 36 - (d) Purchaser shall be entitled to obtain payment of resolved indemnification
claims from the escrow fund, even if the amount of the payment exceeds the
interest in the fund of the Seller or Sellers who are responsible for such
indemnification. In that event, each Seller whose obligation is extinguished
by a payment from the fund that exceeds such SellerÂ’s interest in the fund
shall promptly pay the amount of such excess to the other Sellers in
accordance with their respective interests.



(e) Each Seller shall have a proportionate right to the benefit of the Basket
Amount that is provided by _Section 6.4_ and the 25% and 100%
aggregate liability amounts that are provided by _Section 6.4_. If, because
of the way those amounts are applied, any Seller is deprived of such SellerÂ’s
proportionate benefit of those amounts, Sellers shall make appropriate
adjustments among themselves.



(f) Should Purchaser Indemnitees assert a claim for indemnification under
this _Article VI_ for all or part of which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries would be entitled to indemnification under the Purchase Agreement
dated June 4, 2002 by and among Centennial Healthcare Corporation, Adventist
Health System Sunbelt Healthcare Corporation, North American Health Services,
Inc. (collectively, the "Adventists") and Housecall Medical Resources, Inc.
(the "Adventist Agreement"), the Company will, promptly upon request of the
StockholdersÂ’ Representative, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, assign to
Sellers the rights of the Company and its Subsidiaries to such indemnification
under the Adventist Agreement, which rights Sellers shall be entitled
to pursue at their sole risk and expense with respect to the costs and
expenses (including attorneyÂ’s fees) of pursuing such claim and claims and
Liabilities (including attorneyÂ’s fees) resulting from any counterclaims or
demands by the parties to such litigation (which risk and expense shall not
be deemed indemnification paid under _Article VI_ ). If the Company and its
Subsidiaries are not permitted to assign such claim then they will permit
Sellers to proceed in the name of the Company and its Subsidiaries, at the
same risk and expense to Sellers described above. The parties will provide
support to each other, in accordance with _Section 5.6_ hereof, with respect
to assertion of claims against the Adventists hereunder .

Representative acting on SellersÂ’ behalf); or



(b) by the Purchaser Entities, at any time prior to the Closing if any of the
Sellers is in breach, in any material respect, of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants made by any of the Sellers in this Agreement, which
breach may not be cured with commercially reasonable efforts prior to the
date set forth in _Section 9.1(e)_ ; provided, however, that Purchaser
Entities may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_ if
such breach is the result of a breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty of the Purchaser Entities set forth in any Transaction Document; or



(c) by the Sellers, at any time prior to the Closing if either of the
Purchaser Entities is in breach, in any material respect, of the
representations, warranties or covenants made by it in this Agreement
(provided, that such condition is not the result of any breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty of the Sellers set forth in any
Transaction Document).



 

\- 50 - (d) by the Sellers or the Company, or the Purchaser Entities, if there shall
be any law that makes consummation of the Sale of the Housecall Stock illegal
or otherwise prohibited, or if any order enjoining the Sellers, the Company or
the Purchaser from consummating the Sale of the Housecall Stock is entered and
such order shall have become final and nonappealable.



(e) by the Sellers or the Company, or the Purchaser Entities, at any time
after August 31, 2005, if the Closing has not by that date occurred (unless
the failure of the Closing to occur resulted primarily from the neglect or
other fault of the Party initiating such termination).

 



(f) by Purchaser, as provided in _Section 5.4_.



Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to any of _clauses 9.1(b_
) through _(e)_ shall be effected by written notice from the Sellers or the
Company to the Purchaser (if the Sellers or the Company is the terminating
party) or the Purchaser to the Sellers or the Company (if the Purchaser is the
terminating party). Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _clause
9.1(b)_ through _(d)_ or _(f)_ shall not terminate the liability of any Party
for any breach or default of any covenant or other agreement set forth herein
which exists at the time of such termination.



_Section 9.2 _Remedies_ _

 



(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in _Article VI_ above, no failure
to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege
under this Agreement by any Party shall operate as a waiver of such right,
remedy, power or privilege, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or
further exercise of such right, remedy, power or privilege or the exercise of
any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in _Article VI_ above, the rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided pursuant to this Agreement are cumulative and not exhaustive of any
other rights, remedies, powers and privileges which may be provided by law.



(b) Each party hereto acknowledges that irreparable damage would result
if this Agreement is not specifically enforced. Therefore, the rights and
obligations of the parties under the Agreement, including, without limitation,
their respective rights and obligations to sell and purchase the Housecall
Stock, shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued by any
court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be
applied for and granted in connection therewith. Each party hereto agrees that
monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by
reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby agrees
to waive the defense that a remedy at law may be adequate in any action for
specific performance hereunder.



(c) Except for injunctive or similar equitable relief and except as
otherwise expressly provided in _Sections 6.4(b)_ and _9.2(b)_ , the
indemnity provisions of _Article VI_ shall be the exclusive remedies of the
Parties to this Agreement and their respective officers, directors, members,
managers, partners, employees, Affiliates, agents, representatives,
successors and  



 

\- 51 -  assigns for any and all matters, claims, actions or the like, including, but
not limited to, for any breach of a representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement and, with the foregoing exceptions, such
parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement or to any
further rights (indemnification or otherwise) or claims of any nature
whatsoever in respect thereof, all of which the parties hereto hereby waive.



(d) Except as otherwise expressly provided in _Article VI_ , no delay of or
omission in the exercise of any right, power or remedy accruing to any Party
as a result of any breach or default by any other Party under this Agreement
shall impair any such right, power or remedy, nor shall it be construed as a
waiver of or acquiescence in any such breach or default, or of any similar
breach or default occurring later; nor shall any waiver of any single breach
or default be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default occurring before
or after that waiver.



_Section 9.3  _Confidentiality_ _



Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall maintain all nonpublic information
regarding the Company (with respect to the period prior to the Closing Date)

maintain all nonpublic information regarding the Company or any

Purchaser and its Affiliates confidential and not to waive or release any
obligation of confidentiality owing to the Company or any Subsidiary. Sellers
and the StockholdersÂ’ Representative shall maintain the confidence of all
information concerning the Company that they receive pursuant to _Section 1.6_

information that (i) is required to be disclosed to regulators, (ii) becomes
public through no fault of the Party that is obligated to keep it
confidential, (iii) becomes available to such Party from a third party that
has no obligation of confidentiality to the Company, a Subsidiary or

process, but in that case the compelled Party shall give the other Parties
reasonable notice, prior to making the disclosure, of such subpoena or other
legal process.



_Section 9.4 _Consent to Amendments_ _



This Agreement may be amended or modified, and any provisions of
this Agreement may be waived, in each case upon the approval, in writing,
executed by each of the Company, the Sellers and the Purchaser Entities. No
other course of dealing between or among any of the Parties or any delay in
exercising any rights pursuant to this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of
any rights of any Party.



_Section 9.5 _Successors and Assigns_ _



Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement by or on behalf of the Parties shall
bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and permitted
assigns of the Parties, whether so expressed or not, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned by the Purchaser Entities or the Company prior to the Closing, except
as provided in the  



 

\- 52 -  following sentence, or by the Sellers at any time. The Purchaser Entities
may (a) (at any time prior to the Closing) at their sole discretion, in whole
or in part assign their rights pursuant to this Agreement, including the
right to purchase the Housecall Stock, to one or more of their direct or
indirect wholly owned Affiliates, and (b) designate one or more of their
Affiliates to perform their obligations hereunder (in any or all of which
cases the Purchaser Entities nonetheless shall remain responsible for the
performance of all of their obligations hereunder).



_Section 9.6 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Jury Trial_ _



(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
domestic laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice
of law or conflict provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware to be applied. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
internal law of the State of Delaware shall control the interpretation and
construction of this Agreement, even if under such jurisdictionÂ’s choice of
law or conflict of law analysis, the substantive law of some
other jurisdiction would ordinarily apply.



(b) Courts within the State of Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction
(unless such courts deny jurisdiction) over all disputes between the parties
hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the agreements,
instruments and documents contemplated hereby. The parties hereby consent to
and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. Each of the parties
hereto waives, and agrees not to assert in any such dispute, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, any claim that (i) such party is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) such party and
such partyÂ’s property is immune from any legal process issued by such courts
or (iii) any litigation commenced in such courts is brought in an inconvenient
forum. 



(c) Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in
any proceeding (whether based in contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any transaction or agreement contemplated
hereby or the actions of any Party hereto in the negotiation,
administration, performance or enforcement hereof.
