Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, make any payment of any kind to Sellers following the Effective Date other than (i) payments that are required by contracts listed on the Contracts Schedule and payments of salaries and
benefits at rates currently in effect, and (ii) other payments that will appear as current liabilities (without corresponding current assets) on the Closing Balance Sheet. In addition, all accruals that occur by reason of the Closing, such as the
payment of severance and change-in-control benefits (other than such accruals related to amounts that Purchaser Entities have agreed to pay in accordance with this Agreement), shall for purposes of calculating Net Working Capital, and Delta Earnings
or Delta Losses in accordance with <U>Section 1.6(h)</U>, be deemed to have occurred as of the Effective Date. The Parties agree to make all similar adjustments that are required so that when the Closing occurs, the Parties will to the maximum
possible extent be in the position in which they would have been had the Closing Date and Effective Date both occurred on the Effective Date. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
