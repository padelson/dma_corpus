Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"),

Background   It is proposed that Merger Sub will make a tender offer
(as such offer may be amended from time to time as permitted under this
Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase all the outstanding shares of the
Company\'s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Company Common
Stock"), for $35 per share of Company Common Stock (such amount, or any other
amount per share offered pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, being hereinafter referred to as the "Per Share Amount"),
net to each seller in cash, in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions provided herein.   The respective Boards of Directors of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company have approved and declared advisable this
Agreement, the Offer and the merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub with and
into the Company (after such time, the "Surviving Corporation") following the
consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, whereby pursuant to the Offer each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock properly tendered and not withdrawn (together with any
associated preferred stock or other rights (the "Rights") issued pursuant to
the Rights Agreement (as hereinafter defined)) will be purchased by Merger
Sub at a price per share equal to the Per Share Amount, net to each seller in
cash, and subsequent to the Offer, each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock not owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries (as defined in Section
1.01(a)), excluding shares of Company Common Stock held by persons who object
to the Merger and comply with all the provisions of the DGCL (as hereinafter
defined) concerning the right of holders of shares of Company Common Stock to
require appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock (each such person,
a "Dissenting Stockholder"), will be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Amount pursuant to the Merger.   As a condition and inducement to

into an amendment to the Collaboration and License Agreement dated June 24,

ARTICLE II   THE OFFER   SECTION 2.01 The Offer.   (a) Provided that
this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article IX,
and provided further that none of the events set forth in Annex I hereto
shall have occurred and be continuing, unless otherwise agreed by Parent and
the Company, as soon as practicable after the public announcement of the
execution of this Agreement, but in any event within ten business days after
the date hereof, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer. The consummation of
the Offer shall be subject only to (x) the condition that there shall be
validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the
expiration of the Offer, and not withdrawn, at least a number of shares of
Company Common Stock that, together with the shares of the Company
Common Stock then beneficially owned by Parent, represents a majority of the
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (the
"Minimum Condition") and (y) the other conditions set forth in Annex I
hereto. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any of the
conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions
to the Offer; provided that Merger Sub may not, without the prior written
consent of the Company, (i) waive the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition
or (ii) accept for payment any shares of Company Common Stock tendered
pursuant to the Offer if the Minimum Condition has not been met, and provided
further that no change may be made without the prior written consent of the
Company that changes the form of consideration payable in the Offer,
decreases the consideration payable in the Offer, reduces the maximum number
of shares of Company Common Stock to be purchased in the Offer,
imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I or
makes any other change which is adverse to the holders of Company Common
Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Offer shall remain
open until at least midnight, New York City time, on the date that is 20
business days after the date the Offer is commenced (the "Initial Expiration
Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub may, without the consent of
the Company, (i) if, at any scheduled expiration of the Offer any of the
conditions to Merger Sub\'s obligation to accept shares for payment shall not
be satisfied or waived, extend the Offer beyond the Initial Expiration Date
for a time period reasonably necessary to permit such condition(s) to be
satisfied, (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation or interpretation of the SEC, or the staff thereof, applicable to
the Offer or (iii) extend (or re-extend) the Offer for an aggregate period of
three to 20 business days beyond the latest applicable date that would
otherwise be permitted under clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence, if, as of
such date, all of the conditions to Merger Sub\'s obligations to accept
shares for payment are satisfied or waived, but the number of shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
equals less than 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.
Merger Sub may, without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. In addition, the Per
Share Amount may be increased and the Offer may be extended to the extent
required by law in connection with such increase, in each case without the
consent of the Company.   (b) On the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, file with the SEC a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO ("Schedule   8    TO", and such
Schedule TO and any documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer
will be made, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Offer
Documents"). The Offer Documents shall comply in all material respects with
the requirements of applicable United States federal securities Laws and, on
the date first filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent
or given to the Company\'s stockholders, shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
that in complying with the foregoing commitments, Parent or Merger Sub may
rely on the accuracy of any information supplied by the Company or any of its
stockholders for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer
Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect and to supplement the Offer Documents to include any
information that shall become necessary to include in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Parent shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and, at such time as reasonably agreed by Parent and the Company,
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company
and its counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents prior to their being filed with the SEC or disseminated to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Parent shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, provide the Company and its counsel with any comments
Parent and Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments and shall provide the Company and its counsel an opportunity to
participate in the response of Parent or Merger Sub to such comments.   (c)
Merger Sub shall not terminate, nor shall Parent permit Merger Sub to
terminate, the Offer between scheduled expiration dates (except in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01) and that, in the
event that Merger Sub would otherwise be entitled to terminate the Offer at
any scheduled expiration date thereof due to the failure of one or more of
the conditions set forth in Annex I, unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated pursuant to Section 9.01, Merger Sub, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer until such date as the conditions set
forth in Annex I have been satisfied or such later date as required by
applicable Law; provided that nothing herein shall require Merger Sub to
extend the Offer beyond the termination date listed in Section 9.01(b).  
(d) Subject to the foregoing and upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of the Offer, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay
for, as promptly as practicable after the expiration of the Offer, all shares
of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer. Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Merger Sub on a
timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any and all shares of Company
Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer.   SECTION 2.02 Company Action.   9     (a) The Company hereby
approves of and consents to the Offer and represents that the Board, at a
meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i) determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in
accordance with the DGCL, including Section 203 thereof, and (iii) resolved
to recommend acceptance of the Offer, and, if necessary, adoption of this
Agreement, by the Company\'s stockholders. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Board.   (b)
On the day that the Offer is commenced, the Company shall file with the SEC
and disseminate to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case in
a manner that complies with applicable federal securities Laws, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that, subject
to Section 7.05, shall reflect the recommendations of the Board referred to
in Section 2.02(a) above. Parent and its counsel shall be given an
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 sufficiently in
advance of its filing with the SEC and disseminated to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with
any comments that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such
comments and shall provide Parent and its counsel with an opportunity to
participate in the response of the Company to such comments. The Schedule
14D-9 shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of
applicable United States federal securities Laws and, on the date first filed
with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the Company\'s
stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that in complying with the
foregoing commitments, Parent or Merger Sub may rely on the accuracy of any
information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and
to supplement the Schedule 14D-9 to include any information that shall
become necessary to include in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company
shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to
be filed with the SEC and to be, at such time as reasonably agreed by Parent
and the Company, disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
Laws.   (c) The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of shares of Company
Common Stock and with security position listings of shares of Company Common
Stock held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all
other available listings and computer files containing names, addresses and
security position listings of record holders and beneficial owners of shares
of Company Common Stock as Parent may reasonably request. The Company shall
promptly furnish Parent with such additional information, including updated
listings and computer files of stockholders, mailing labels and
security position listings, and such other assistance in disseminating the
Offer Documents to holders of shares of Company Common   10    Stock as
Parent may reasonably request. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents
and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger,
Parent, Merger Sub and each of their affiliates, agents and advisors shall
hold in confidence the information contained in such labels, listings
and files, shall use such information only in connection with the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated in accordance with Section 9.01, shall deliver to the Company, and
shall use their reasonable efforts to cause their affiliates, agents and
advisors to deliver, all copies and any extracts or summaries from such
information then in their possession.   SECTION 2.03 Directors.   (a)
Effective upon the acceptance for payment pursuant to the Offer of a number
of shares of Company Common Stock that satisfies the Minimum Condition,
Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to
the next whole number, on the Board that equals the product of (i) the total
number of directors on the Board (giving effect to the election of any
additional directors pursuant to this Section 2.03) and (ii) the percentage
that the number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by
Parent and/or Merger Sub (including shares of Company Common Stock
accepted for payment) bears to the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding, and the Company shall take all action necessary to cause
Parent\'s designees to be elected or appointed to the Board, including
increasing the number of directors, and seeking and accepting resignations of
incumbent directors. At such time, the Company will also use its best efforts
to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of
members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the
Board and (ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company
identified by Parent (and each committee thereof) that represents the same
percentage as such individuals represent on the Board, in each case only to
the extent permitted by applicable Law including the rules of The Nasdaq
National Market or any other exchange on which the Company Common Stock is
listed. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.03, the parties
hereto shall use their respective best efforts to ensure that at least two of
the members of the Board, who are not officers, employees or affiliates of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
affiliates, shall, at all times prior to the Effective Time, be individuals
who were independent directors of the Company (for purposes of the continued
listing requirements of The Nasdaq National Market) on the date hereof (the
"Continuing Directors"); provided that if there shall be in office fewer than
two Continuing Directors for any reason, the Board shall cause a person
designated by the remaining Continuing Director to fill such vacancy who
shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes of this
Agreement, or if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors of
the Company then in office shall designate two persons to fill such
vacancies who will not be directors, officers, employees or affiliates of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
affiliates and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for
all purposes of this Agreement. The Board shall not delegate any matter
covered by this Section 2.03 to any committee of the Board, unless such
committee consists only of the Continuing Directors.   (b) The Company\'s
obligations to appoint Parent\'s designees to the Board shall be subject to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder.  
11    The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall include in
the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its
officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section 2.03, so long as Parent shall have
provided to the Company on a timely basis in writing and be solely
responsible for any information with respect to itself, Merger Sub and their
respective nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1.   (c) Following the election or appointment of
Parent\'s designees pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time,
only the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required
to authorize any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment
of this Agreement requiring action by the Board, any extension of time
for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger
Sub, any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein for the benefit of the Company and any other action of the
Company hereunder which adversely affects the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock (other than Parent or Merger Sub) in any respect.   ARTICLE

the five business day after satisfaction or waiver of all conditions set
forth in Article VIII that are capable of being satisfied prior to the
Closing, at the offices of Cadwalader, Wickersham and Taft LLP, 100 Maiden

place as the parties shall agree (the "Closing Date").   SECTION 3.03
Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall
be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.  
12    SECTION 3.04 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.   (a) At the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be

except for Article I thereof which shall continue to read as follows: "The

the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected

virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:   (a) except as
provided by Section 3.06(b) or 3.09, each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and all rights
in respect thereof shall be converted automatically into the right to receive
the Per Share Amount (as such amount may be adjusted pursuant to Section
3.11), without interest (the "Merger Consideration"); all such shares of
Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Per Share Amount, without interest, following the surrender of
such certificate in accordance with Section 3.08;   (b) each share of
Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of
Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof, and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto; and   (c) each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.  
13     SECTION 3.07 Stock Options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  
(a) The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than twenty (20)
business days following the date of this Agreement) take such actions as may
be necessary such that, upon the Effective Time, each option outstanding
pursuant to the Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 1998 Stock Option Plan, as
amended and the Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 2000 Equity Plan, as
amended (together, the "Company Stock Plans" and each option granted
thereunder a "Company Option") is treated in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 3.07.   (b) At the Effective Time, each vested Company
Option outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (a "Vested Company Option") shall be
surrendered and cancelled and only entitle the holder thereof, in respect of
cancellation thereof, to receive an amount in cash from the Surviving
Corporation equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously subject to such Vested Company Option and (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the per share exercise price of
such Vested Company Option.   (c) At the Effective Time, each unvested
Company Option outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (an "Unvested Company Option") shall
be surrendered and cancelled. Except as provided in Section 3.07(h), in
consideration of such cancellation of an Unvested Company Option, the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation the
following:   (i) An amount in cash, immediately after the Effective Time,
equal to the product of (A) 50% of the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously subject to such Unvested Company Option on a
per grant basis (such portion of an Unvested Company Option hereinafter
referred to as "Cashout Option") and (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Amount over the per share exercise price of such Cashout Option, and   (ii)
Except as provided in Section 3.07(d), with respect to the portion of each
Unvested Company Option that is not a Cashout Option (each, a "Retention
Option"), on each date following the Effective Time on which the Retention
Option would have become vested but for the application of the terms of this
Section 3.07(c) (each such date, a "Vesting Date"), an amount in cash equal
to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously subject to such Retention Option that would have vested on such
Vesting Date, and (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the
per share exercise price of such Retention Option (the "Vested
Payment"), which payment shall be made within ten (10) business days
following the related Vesting Date, provided that the holder continues to be
an employee of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their affiliates
on such Vesting Date. Interest will be credited quarterly on each Vested
Payment under this Section 3.07(c) at the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate
from the Effective Time through the Vesting Date related to such payment.  
(d) With respect to the individuals listed on Schedule 1.01 of this Agreement
(each a "Scheduled Holder"), no payments shall be made in respect of
Retention Options held by the Scheduled Holders until the third anniversary
of the Effective Time, at which time a Scheduled Holder shall receive an
amount in cash with respect to each Retention Option held by  
14    such holder equal to (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously subject to such Retention Option and (B) the excess,
if any, of the Per Share Amount over the per share exercise price of such
Retention Option, provided that the Scheduled Holder continues to be an
employee of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their affiliates on
such third anniversary. Interest will be credited quarterly on each payment
under this Section 3.07(d) at the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate from the
Effective Time through the third anniversary of the Effective Time.   (e)
In the event of termination of a holder\'s (including a Scheduled Holder\'s)
employment with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their affiliates
(i) by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their affiliates without
Cause, (ii) by the holder with Good Reason, or (iii) due to the holder\'s
death or Disability, with respect to each Retention Option of the holder, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay to the Holder an amount in cash equal to the
product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
subject to such Retention Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Amount over the per share exercise price of such Retention Option, reduced by
the amount of any Vested Payments previously made to the holder pursuant to
Section 3.07(c) in respect of such Retention Option. Interest will be
credited quarterly on the amount provided for in this Section 3.07(e) at
the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate from the Effective Time through the
holder\'s date of termination.   (f) The holder of a Retention Option will
forfeit his right to the payments and interest set forth in Section 3.07(c),
Section 3.07(d) and Section 3.07(e) above if, prior to the Vesting Date (or
the third anniversary of the Effective Time, in the case of a Scheduled
Holder), the holder\'s employment with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
any of their affiliates is terminated (i) by the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or any of their affiliates for Cause or (ii) by the holder without
Good Reason.   (g) If an option holder\'s employment with the Company
is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or by the holder without
Good Reason, on or after the date of the consummation of the Offer and before
the Effective Time, the holder\'s Company Options (vested and unvested) shall
not terminate in connection with such termination of employment and shall be
treated as outstanding immediately before the Effective Time for purposes of
this Section 3.07.   (h) At the consummation of the Offer, all Company
Options held by persons who are non-employee members of the Board shall
become fully vested, and at the Effective Time, each such Company Option
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
surrendered and cancelled and entitle the holder thereof, in respect of
cancellation thereof, to receive an amount in cash from the Surviving
Corporation equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously subject to such Company Option and (ii) the excess,
if any, between the Per Share Amount over the per share exercise price of
such Company Option.   (i) For purposes of this Section 3.07, the
following terms shall have the meaning set forth below:   15     (i)
"Cause" shall mean an employee\'s (a) misappropriation of funds, (b)
conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, (c) gross negligence or
willful malfeasance in the performance of the employee\'s duties or (d)
failure to substantially perform his or her duties following written request
for such performance by the Surviving Company or Parent, other than as a
result of the employee\'s mental or physical incapacity.   (ii) "Good
Reason" shall mean a termination of employment initiated by the holder upon
one or more of the following occurrences:   (A) any significant reduction
by the Company,  Surviving Corporation, Parent or an affiliate of the
duties,  job responsibilities or position of the holder, other than a 
reduction in the duties, job responsibilities or position of  the holder that
results from the Company (or the Surviving  Corporation) no longer being a
public company or becoming a  subsidiary of Parent;   (B) any reduction in
the holder\'s base salary;  or   (C) the moving of the principal work
location to  which the holder is assigned to a location more than 45 miles 
from its location immediately before the move; provided that  such relocation
materially increases the holder\'s commuting  distance.   (iii)
"Disability" shall mean the holder\'s disability under the long-term
disability plan of the Company, Surviving Corporation, Parent or an
affiliate, as applicable.   (j) On or before December 31, 2003, the Company
shall take such actions as may be necessary such that no new contributions
shall be accepted by, or made to, the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the "ESPP") after such date, and any cash remaining in participants\'
accounts after such date will be distributed to participants, and the ESPP
shall be terminated effective as of January 1, 2004, which termination shall
be subject to the consummation of the Offer.   SECTION 3.08 Surrender of
Certificates and Payment.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as an agent (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, for the purpose of exchanging certificates
representing the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of the
Effective Time (the "Certificates") for the Per Share Amount. Parent will, or
will cause Merger Sub to, deposit with the Exchange Agent, prior to or upon
the Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient for the payment of the
Merger Consideration (the "Payment Fund"). Funds made available to the
Exchange Agent shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Merger
Sub, or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation. Any interest and
other income resulting from investments shall be paid to Parent upon
termination of the Payment Fund in accordance with Section 3.08(d) below. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will send, or
will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions
(which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the  
16    Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) for use in such
exchange.   (b) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed
by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
properly completed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefore the Merger Consideration, without interest, for
each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.08, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section
3.08, without interest thereon, and shall not evidence any interest in, or
any right to exercise the rights of a stockholder or other equity holder of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation.   (c) If any portion of the Per
Share Amount is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required
as a result of such payment to a person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d) Any portion of the Per
Share Amount deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.08(a)
(and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains undistributed
to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company
Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Per Share Amount in respect
of such shares of Company Common Stock without any interest thereon. Any
portion of the Per Share Amount remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock as of a date which is immediately prior to the date that
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person
in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (e) Any
portion of the Per Share Amount deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to
Section 3.08(a) to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal
rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.  
SECTION 3.09 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 3.06(a), shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a Dissenting Stockholder shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Per Share Amount, but shall be converted into the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due such
Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the DGCL, unless such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses its right to appraisal. From and after
the Effective Time, a   17    Dissenting Stockholder who has properly
exercised such appraisal rights shall not have any rights of a stockholder of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to his shares, except
those provided under Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to
appraisal, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they
had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Per
Share Amount, without interest. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of shares of Company
Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to
do any of the foregoing.   SECTION 3.10 Stock Transfer Books. After the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided herein or by any Laws. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Per Share Amount
provided for, and in accordance with, the procedures set forth in this
Article.   SECTION 3.11 Adjustments. If at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, a change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason
of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock, split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a
record date during such period or as otherwise contemplated in Section 3.11
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Per Share Amount shall be adjusted
appropriately.   SECTION 3.12 Withholding Rights. Parent and Merger
Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to
deduct and withhold, from the Per Share Amount payable to the holder of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or the Merger, any
withholding and stock transfer Taxes and such other amounts as are required
pursuant to the Code or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign
tax law. To the extent that any such amounts are so withheld by Parent or
Merger Sub, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or
Merger Sub.   SECTION 3.13 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, following the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of
a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as the Surviving Corporation
may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in respect of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per Share Amount to be paid
in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article.   18     SECTION 3.14
Associated Rights. References in Article II and Article III of this Agreement
to Company Common Stock shall include, unless the context requires otherwise,
any associated Rights.   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
THE COMPANY   The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub that the statements contained in this Article IV are true and correct.
The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding
to numbered and lettered sections contained in this Article IV, and the
disclosures in any paragraph of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall qualify
other sections in this Article IV only to the extent it is reasonably and
readily apparent from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to such other sections. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has made or shall be deemed to have made any representation or
warranty to Parent or Merger Sub other than as set forth in this Article
IV.   SECTION 4.01 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. Each of
the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and, to the extent applicable, in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. Each of the
Company and each Subsidiary of the Company has the requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have
such power and authority would not reasonably be expected to, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each
Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 4.02 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Company
has heretofore made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents, each as amended to date, of the Company and each
Subsidiary of the Company. Such certificates of incorporation, bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents are in full force and effect.   SECTION
4.03 Capitalization.   (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 50,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Company Preferred Stock"). As of
December 16, 2003, (i) 34,103,769 shares of Company Common Stock were issued
and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock were held in the

any Intellectual Property of any person. To the knowledge of the Company,
there are no patent rights of any third party known to be dominating,

Subsidiaries (and, to the Company\'s knowledge, with respect to material
patents or patent applications, Controlled by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) that individually or in the aggregate had or would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   To the knowledge of the
Company, there are no published patents, patent applications, articles or

the Company or such Subsidiary or such appropriate owners, as the case may
be.   (e) Section 4.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a

directly or indirectly, do, or propose to do, any of the following without
the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed:   (a) take any action to
cause Parent\'s representations and warranties set forth in Article V to be
untrue in any material respect; or   (b) take any action that could
reasonably be likely to materially delay the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger, provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries be required to sell or otherwise dispose of, or permit the sale
or other disposition of, any assets of Parent, the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries, whether as a condition to obtaining any approval
from a Governmental Authority or any other person or for any other
reason.   ARTICLE VII   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   SECTION 7.01 Proxy
Statement.   (a) As soon as possible after commencement of the Offer, the
Company shall commence preparation of a preliminary Proxy
Statement. Following the consummation of the Offer, if approval of this
Agreement and the Merger by the stockholders of the Company is required by
applicable Law, the Company will, as soon as is possible following the
consummation of the Offer, file such preliminary Proxy Statement with the
SEC. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to respond to any comments
by the SEC or its staff to such preliminary Proxy Statement and to cause a
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company.
The Company will notify Parent promptly of the receipt of and will respond
promptly to any (i) comments from the SEC or its staff and (ii) request by
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information and will supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Merger. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to be involved in the drafting of and review and comment upon the
Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto and any such
correspondence prior to its filing with the SEC or dissemination to
the Company\'s stockholders. No amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement will be made by the Company without the approval of Parent, which
will not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed; provided, however,
that amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement reflecting actions
taken by the Board to comply with its fiduciary duties shall not require the
approval of Parent. If necessary, after the Proxy Statement shall have been
so mailed, the Company shall promptly circulate amended, supplemental or
supplemented proxy material, and, if required in connection therewith,
resolicit proxies. Subject to Section 7.05(b), the Company shall include in
the definitive Proxy Statement the unanimous recommendation of the Board that
stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval of the Merger and
the adoption of this Agreement.   40    (b) The information supplied by
Parent and the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not at the
time (i) the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC, (ii) the Proxy Statement
is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company or (iii) of the
Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or fail
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. For purposes of the foregoing, it is
understood and agreed that information concerning or related to Parent will
be deemed to have been supplied by Parent and information concerning or
related to the Company and the Stockholder Meeting shall be deemed to have
been supplied by the Company. All documents filed with the SEC in connection
with the Merger will comply as to form and substance in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.   (c) Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if Parent or Merger Sub shall acquire at least 90% of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise, the parties hereto shall, subject to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted hereunder) waiver of all conditions to the Merger, take, or
cause to be taken, all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger
to be effective as soon as practicable after the acceptance for payment and
purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer without the
Stockholder Meeting, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. Parent shall
cause all shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Offer and
all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent or with respect to which Parent then has the right to
vote, if any, to be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the approval of the Merger.   SECTION 7.02 Stockholder
Meeting. If required by applicable Law, the Company, acting through the
Board, shall, in accordance with applicable Law, duly call, convene and hold
a special meeting of the holders of the Company Common Stock (the
"Stockholder Meeting"), as soon as reasonably practicable after the
acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer, for the purpose of voting upon this Agreement and the Merger, and the
Company shall submit this Agreement at such meeting. Subject to Section
7.05(b), the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to solicit from the
stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the Merger and take
all actions reasonably necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of Parent,
advisable to secure the approval of the stockholders of the Company required
under applicable Law and the Company\'s certificate of incorporation and
bylaws to effect the Merger.   SECTION 7.03 Appropriate Action; Consents;
Filings.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the Merger as promptly
as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Authorities any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders

Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Offer and the Merger, (iii) effect
all registrations, filings, and transfers of Environmental Permits necessary
for the operation of the   41   Company\'s business as presently

(iv) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger
required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or
state securities Laws and (B) any other applicable Law; provided that Parent
and the Company shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making
of all such filings and, if requested, to accept all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested by the other party in connection therewith.
The Company and Parent shall furnish to each other all information required
for any application or other filing to be made by the other party pursuant to
the rules and regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) (i) Each of Parent and
the Company shall give (or shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to give)
any notices to third parties, and use, and cause its respective Subsidiaries
to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third party
consents, (A) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, (B) disclosed or required to be disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Schedule or (C) required to prevent a Material Adverse
Effect from occurring prior to or after the Effective Time.   (ii) In the
event that Parent or the Company shall fail to obtain any third party consent
described in subsection (b)(i) above, it shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably requested by
the other party, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent,
their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or
which could reasonably be expected to result after the Effective Time, from
the failure to obtain such consent.   (c) From the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each party shall promptly notify the other party in
writing of any pending or, to the knowledge of the first party, threatened
action, proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Authority or any
other person (i) challenging or seeking material damages in connection with
the Offer or the Merger or (ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or otherwise limit the right of
Parent or, to the knowledge of such party, Parent\'s Subsidiaries to own or
operate all or any portion of the businesses or assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, which in either case is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect prior to or after the Effective Time.   (d) Each party shall
file the appropriate "Notification and Report Form" pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby by January 16, 2004 and
shall supply promptly any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act including prompt compliance
with a "Second Request" from the Federal Trade Commission or Department of
Justice, or as the relevant agency may otherwise agree. Each party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act. In addition, each party promptly shall make any other
filing that may be required under any antitrust Law or by any antitrust
authority. The parties shall take any and all reasonable steps necessary to
avoid or eliminate as soon as practicable, each and every impediment under
any antitrust Law that may be asserted by any antitrust authority so as to
enable the parties to close expeditiously the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each party shall bear its respective filing fees associated with the
HSR filings and any other similar filings   42   required in any other
jurisdictions. Parent and the Company shall instruct their respective counsel
to cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to facilitate
and expedite the identification and resolution of any such issues (including,
keeping each other appropriately informed of all communications from and to
personnel of the reviewing antitrust authority, and conferring with
each other regarding appropriate contacts with and response to personnel of
said antitrust authority) and, consequently, expiration of the applicable HSR
Act waiting period at the earliest practicable date.   (e) Nothing in this
Section 7.03 shall require any of Parent and its Subsidiaries to sell or
otherwise dispose of, or permit the sale or other disposition of, any assets
of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, whether as a
condition to obtaining any approval from a Governmental Authority or any
other person or for any other reason.   SECTION 7.04 Access to Information;
Confidentiality; Return/Destruction of Company Confidential Information.  
(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the
officers, directors, employees, auditors and agents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, afford the officers, employees and agents of Parent and
Merger Sub complete access at all reasonable times to the
officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, plants and other
facilities, books and records of the Company and each Subsidiary of the
Company, and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such financial,
operating and other data and information as Parent or Merger Sub, through
their officers, employees or agents, may reasonably request. Any
investigation pursuant to this Section 7.04 shall be conducted in a manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company
or its Subsidiaries.   (b) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall continue
to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2002, as
amended on September 5, 2003, September 6, 2003 and December 2, 2003
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"); provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, each party
hereto (and each employee, representative, or other agent of any party) may
disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the Federal
income tax treatment and Federal income tax structure of any and all
transaction contemplated herein and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are or have been provided to any party
(or to any employee, representative, or other agent of any party) relating to
such tax treatment or tax structure; provided, further, that this
authorization of disclosure shall not apply to restrictions reasonably
necessary to comply with securities Laws. In addition, each party hereto
acknowledges that it has no proprietary or exclusive rights to any tax matter
or tax idea related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
preceding sentence is intended to ensure that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall not be treated as having been offered under
conditions of confidentiality for purposes of the Confidentiality Regulations
and shall be construed in a manner consistent with such purpose.   (c) In
the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section
9.01, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents to,   43   (i) return promptly every
document furnished to them by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company,
or any officer, director, employee, auditor or agent of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company in connection with the Merger and containing
Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) and
all copies thereof in their possession, and cause any other parties to whom
such documents may have been furnished promptly to return such documents and
all copies thereof, other than such documents as may have been filed with the
SEC or otherwise be publicly available and (ii) destroy promptly all
documents created by them from any Confidential Information and all
copies thereof in their possession, and cause any other parties to whom such
documents may have been furnished to destroy promptly such documents and any
copies thereof, and provide certifications to the Company as to such
destruction as may be reasonably requested by the Company.   (d) The
Company shall, within five business days of the date hereof, exercise (to the
extent practicable) all of the rights it has under all Applicable
Confidentiality Agreements to demand the return or destruction of any
confidential information regarding the Company that was provided pursuant
to such agreements within the past six months. For purpose hereof
"Applicable Confidentiality Agreements" shall mean all confidentiality
agreements, nondisclosure agreements or similar agreements that were entered
into in connection with a third party\'s evaluation of a potential
transaction or transactions with the Company (i) involving the marketing,
developing or licensing of any Product or (ii) similar to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that has not been consummated as of the date
hereof.   SECTION 7.05 No Solicitation of Transactions.   (a) Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall, directly or indirectly,
through any officer, director, employee, investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant, agent or otherwise, (i) solicit, initiate,
facilitate or encourage the submission or making of any offer or proposal
which constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal
or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any person, any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any
way with respect to, or assist or participate in, or facilitate, any
Acquisition Proposal, except that the Company may take any action referred to
in this clause (ii) (A) if the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with independent legal counsel (who may be the Company\'s
regularly engaged independent legal counsel), that the failure to take such
action could reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, (B) if the Board determines in good faith, after
receiving the advice of its financial advisor that the Acquisition Proposal
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (C) the
Company enters into an agreement preserving the confidentiality of all
information provided on terms no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Superior Proposal" means any Acquisition Proposal made by a third person for
at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or all
or substantially all of the assets of the Company which is not conditioned on
any financing and is not solicited, initiated or encouraged in violation of
this Section 7.05, that the Board in good faith concludes by a majority vote
(after consulting with its independent legal counsel and Lehman Brothers Inc.
(or another nationally recognized investment banking firm)), taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation) and the third person  
44   making such Acquisition Proposal, (i) would, if consummated, result in
a transaction that is more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders (in
their capacities as stockholders), from a financial point of view, than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is capable of
being completed.   (b) Except as set forth in this Section 7.05(b),
neither the Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or
propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the transactions

recommendation by the Board or any committee thereof in favor of the Offer,
this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend or propose to approve
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal of any person or group other than
Parent and Merger Sub or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal of any person or group other than Parent and Merger Sub
(other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with the
terms of Section 7.05(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the time
of acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer, the
Board may, in response to a Superior Proposal, withdraw or modify its
approval or recommendation in favor of the Offer, this Agreement or
the Merger, if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with independent legal counsel (who may be the Company\'s regularly
engaged independent legal counsel), that the failure to take such action
would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any such withdrawal,
modification or change of the recommendation of the Board shall not change
the approval of the Board for purposes of causing any state takeover statute
or other state law to be inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (c) The Company shall, and
shall direct or cause its directors, officers, employees, representatives and
agents to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal as of the date hereof; provided, however, that the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.05(c) shall not prohibit the Company
from considering any new Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section
7.05(a) that may be made by any such person after the date hereof.   (d)
The Company shall immediately advise Parent in writing of the receipt,
directly or indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations, or
proposals relating to an Acquisition Proposal (including the specific terms
thereof and the identity of the other party the material terms and conditions
of such Acquisition Proposal, as well as any material modification to the
terms or conditions of such Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall provide
the notice pursuant to this Section 7.05(d) prior to providing any person or
group with non-public information regarding the Company. The Company shall
promptly provide to Parent any non-public information regarding the Company
provided to any other person or group which was not previously provided to
Parent, such additional information to be provided no later than the date of
provision of such information to such other person or group   (e) The
Company shall not terminate this Agreement and enter into an agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company has at all times after
the date of this Agreement complied with the provisions of this Section 7.05,
(ii) the Company has provided Parent written notice that it intends to
terminate this Agreement, which notice shall (A) specify the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal (B) identify the person  
45   or group making the Superior Proposal and (C) advise Parent that the
Company intends to approve or recommend a Superior Proposal or enter into an
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, (iii) within five business
days following the delivery of such written notice, Parent has not proposed
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the Board
determines, in its good faith judgment (after receiving the advice of its
financial advisor and after considering such proposed adjustments and
negotiations relating thereto), that this Agreement, as so proposed to be
adjusted, is not as favorable from a financial point of view to the
Company\'s stockholders as such Superior Proposal and (iv) the Company
complies with the provisions of Sections 9.01(d)(ii) and 9.03(a) hereof.  
(f) The Company shall not release any third party from, or waive any
provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the
Company is a party unless the Board determines in good faith
after consultation with independent legal counsel (who may be the Company\'s
regularly engaged independent legal counsel), that the failure to take such
action could reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary duties.  
SECTION 7.06 Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance.  
(a) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification
than are set forth in Article VIII and Section 6.07 of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company, respectively, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time,
were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company,
unless such modification shall be required bylaw.   (b) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall jointly and severally, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, each
present and former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or
expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, (x) arising out of
or pertaining to the Offer or the Merger or (y) otherwise with respect to any
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the same
extent as provided in the Company\'s certificate of incorporation or bylaws
or any applicable contract or agreement as in effect on the date hereof, in
each case for a period of six years after the date hereof. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
7.06(b), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to assume the defense thereof with legal counsel of Parent\'s
choosing and Parent shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party may employ counsel of its own choosing if
it has reasonably concluded upon the advice of counsel that there may be a
conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and   46   the Parent
and the Surviving Corporation in the conduct of the defense of an action,
(ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
and (iii) Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); and provided, further, that Parent shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law.   (c) Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for six years
from the Effective Time, the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
policies maintained by the Company as of the date hereof (provided that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor a policy or policies of at
least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are not
materially less favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this Section 7.06(c)
more than an amount per year equal to 150% of the annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance as of the date hereof.   (d) In the event Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger

any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
7.06.   (e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 7.06
shall be enforceable by, and are intended to benefit, each Indemnified
Party.   SECTION 7.07 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to
the Company, of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which reasonably could be expected to cause
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate and (b) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as
the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.07 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.   SECTION 7.08 Public Announcements. No public release
or announcement concerning the Offer or the Merger shall be issued by either
party without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), except as such release

United States or non-United States securities exchange, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall use its best efforts
to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance.   47    SECTION 7.09

conditions of employment that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate,
as Parent provides to similarly-situated employees of Parent, (ii)
compensation, employee benefits (other than equity related awards), and terms
and conditions of employment that are substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to those of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the

Company prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing
to the contrary, none of the provisions contained herein shall operate to
duplicate any benefit provided to any Assumed Employee or the funding of any
such benefit. Parent and the Surviving Corporation will also use best efforts

for all conditions that all Assumed Employees and their covered dependents
have as of the Closing and (ii) waiting periods under each plan that would
otherwise be applicable to newly hired employees to be waived to the same
extent waived or satisfied under the Plans; provided that nothing in this
sentence shall limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation from
amending or terminating any employee benefit plan or arrangement or entering
into new or different employee benefit plans or arrangements, provided such
plans or arrangements treat the Assumed Employees in a substantially similar
manner as employees of Parent are treated.   (b) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will give each Assumed Employee credit, for purposes of Parent\'s
and the Surviving Corporation\'s vacation and/or other paid leave benefit
programs, for such employees accrued and unpaid vacation and/or paid leave

shall have violated or breached in any material respect any of its
obligations under Section 7.05;   (d) by the Company (i) if Merger Sub
shall have failed to commence the Offer within ten business days following
the date of this Agreement; provided that the failure by Merger Sub to
commence the Offer is not due in any way to any action or failure to act on
the part of the Company or (ii) in order to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company
shall have complied with its obligations under Section 7.05; provided,
further, that any termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
clause (ii) of this Section 9.01(d) shall not be effective until the Company
has made payment of the Termination Fee required by Section 9.03(a);   (e)
by Parent if (i) the Offer shall have been extended for an aggregate period
of at least 15 business days beyond the Initial Expiration Date, and (ii) on
such extended date of expiration, the Minimum Condition shall not have been
satisfied;   (f) by the Company, if prior to the acceptance for payment of
the shares of Company Common Stock under the Offer, (i) Parent shall have
materially breached or failed to perform in any material respect
its obligations, covenants or agreements under the Agreement (except to the
extent such breach, together with all such breaches, does not and would not
be likely to have a material adverse effect on Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s
ability to consummate the Offer or the Merger), or (ii) the representations
and warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement shall not have been true
and correct when made or at the consummation of the Offer as if made at and
as of such time (other than representations and warranties which by their
terms address matters only as of another specified date, which shall be true
and correct only as of such date), except for such failures to be true and
correct that do not and would not be likely to have a material adverse effect
on Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s ability to consummate the Offer or the Merger
(a "Terminating Parent Breach"); provided, however, that if such Terminating
Parent Breach is curable by Parent through the exercise of its best efforts
and Parent continues to exercise such best efforts, the Company may not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.01(f) for a period of 30 days
from the date on which the Company delivers to Parent written notice setting
forth in reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise to such Terminating
Parent Breach; or   50    (g) by Parent, if prior to the acceptance for
payment of the shares of Company Common Stock under the Offer, the Company
shall have breached any representation, warranty, or agreement set forth in
this Agreement, which breach is reasonably likely to result in any condition
set forth in Annex I not being satisfied on or prior to expiration of the
Offer (a "Terminating Company Breach"); provided, however, that, if such
Terminating Company Breach is curable by the Company through the exercise of
its best efforts and the Company continues to exercise such best efforts,
Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.01(g) for a
period of 30 days from the date on which Parent delivers to the Company
written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances giving
rise to such Terminating Company Breach.   SECTION 9.02 Effect of
Termination. Except as provided in Section 10.01, in the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void, there shall be no liability under this Agreement on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective
officers or directors and all rights and obligations of any party hereto
shall cease; provided, however, if such termination shall result from the
willful (i) failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance
of the obligations of the other party or (ii) failure of either party to
perform a covenant hereof, such party shall be fully liable for any and all
liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a
result of such failure. The provisions of Sections 7.04(b), 9.02, 9.03,
10.04, 10.05, 10.07, 10.08 and 10.11 shall survive any termination hereof
pursuant to Section 9.01.   SECTION 9.03 Fees and Expenses.   (a) The

prior to such termination and within 12 months of such termination any
Acquisition Proposal is consummated with the party (or any of its affiliates)
that made the pre-termination Acquisition Proposal;   (iv) pursuant to
Section 9.01(e) or (g) and an Acquisition Proposal shall have been received
or announced prior to such termination and within 12 months of such
termination an Acquisition Proposal with any party other than Parent or
Merger Sub is announced or consummated.   (b) Any payment required to be
made pursuant to Section 9.03(a) shall be made as promptly as practicable but
not later than five business days after it shall become due and shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent.   51    (c) Except as set forth in this Section 9.03, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer and
the Merger shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not
the Offer or the Merger is consummated.   SECTION 9.04 Amendment. This
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on
behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the

amount or change the type of consideration to be received by the stockholders
of the Company pursuant to the Merger. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.   SECTION
9.05 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may

by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time or earlier
termination.   SECTION 10.02 Notices. All notices, requests,

matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a
merger, by operation of law or otherwise), except that Parent and Merger Sub

thereby and may be enforced by such persons).   SECTION 10.06 Specific
Performance. The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at
law or equity.   SECTION 10.07 Governing Law. This Agreement shall

Delaware. The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of any state or federal court sitting within the State of Delaware for the
purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any party hereto and (b) irrevocably waive, and shall not to assert by way of
motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not

or that this Agreement or the Merger may not be enforced in or by any of the
above-named courts.   SECTION 10.08 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OFFER OR THE MERGER. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies

Offer and the Merger, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual
waivers and certifications in this Section 10.08.   SECTION 10.09
