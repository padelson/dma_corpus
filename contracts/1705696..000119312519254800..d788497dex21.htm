each Company Subsidiary not to:

 

(a) sell, pledge, transfer, assign, abandon, dispose of or otherwise
subject to any Encumbrance (except for Permitted Encumbrances and as
permitted under subparagraph (c) below) the Conveyed Property or any Transfer
Sub Membership Interests;

 



9

    

(b) acquire any real property;

 

(c) enter into any lease, sublease or license of the Conveyed Property or
any renewal, modification, amendment or termination of any of the foregoing
(any of the foregoing, an " _Occupancy Agreement_ "), other than: (x) any
renewal of a Tenant Lease exercised by the Tenant in accordance with the terms
of such Tenant Lease and (y) entering into any lease, sublease or license of
the Conveyed Property that (1) is an arms-length agreement on market terms,
(2) is for a term not to exceed six months and that in any event terminates
by its terms prior to the Closing Date and (3) pursuant to which the
applicable tenant, subtenant or licensee is required to vacate its premises
before the Closing Date, provided, that if the tenant, subtenant or licensee
does not timely vacate its premises, the Seller shall be responsible for all
costs, whether incurred before, on or after the Closing Date, for removal of
the tenant, subtenant or licensee from its premises; or

 

(d) enter into any Contract (or amendment, modification or supplement of
any existing Contract) to sell the Conveyed Property or the Transfer Sub

Agreement.

 

Section 7.04 _Post-Closing Escrow_. At the Closing, the PropCo Buyer shall
deposit with the Escrow Agent, pursuant to an escrow agreement consistent
with the provisions of this Section 7.04 and reasonably acceptable to the
Seller, the PropCo Buyer and the Escrow Agent (the "Transfer Sub Escrow
Agreement"), a portion of the Transfer Sub Membership Interests Purchase
Price consisting of cash in an amount equal to $3,500,000 (the "Original
Escrowed Amount"), which may be reduced from time to time in accordance with
the terms of the Transfer Sub Escrow Agreement to reflect any sums paid to
the PropCo Buyer from time to time pursuant to this Section 7.04 (the
"Escrowed Amount"). Each of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section __ 6.01 hereof and Sections 3.01(e), 3.01(f), 3.02(e)-(h),
3.06(b)-(c) and 3.16(i) of the Transaction Agreement shall be deemed
"Surviving Representations" for purposes of this Section 7.04; provided, that,
any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section __
3.01(f) (other than Subsection 3.01(f)(i) and Subsection 3.01(f)(iv)) shall
not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Section __ 7.04 if such
breach would have occurred even if the Conveyed Property had been conveyed
directly to the PropCo Buyer (rather than conveyed to the Transfer Sub with
the Transfer Sub Membership Interests transferred to the PropCo Buyer).
Notwithstanding the first sentence of Section __ 10.14 or the
Transaction Agreement, the Surviving Representations shall survive the
Closing for a period of one (1) __ year following the Closing Date (the
"Survival Period"); provided, that if, prior to the end of the Survival
Period, the PropCo Buyer shall have asserted in writing a claim with respect
to the particular Surviving Representation (a "Claim Notice") and commenced a
legal proceeding against the Seller within sixty (60) days of delivery of such
Claim Notice alleging that the Seller is in breach of such Surviving
Representation and that the PropCo Buyer has suffered damages as a result
thereof, such claim shall continue beyond the end of the Survival Period. If
the Parties agree, or a court of competent jurisdiction determines, that (a)
the applicable Surviving

 



10

    

 Representation was breached as of the Closing Date and (b) the PropCo Buyer
suffered actual damages (including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys fees
and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses) by reason of such breach
("Surviving Representation Damages"), then the PropCo Buyer shall be entitled
to receive an amount equal to such damages, but in no event in an amount
greater than the then-remaining Escrowed Amount. Any Surviving Representation
Damages shall be determined without duplication of recovery by the PropCo
Buyer by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such loss constituting a
breach of more than one (1) Surviving Representation. Except as set forth
in Section 10.14, following the Survival Period, the Seller shall have no
further liability with respect to the Surviving Representations and the PropCo
Buyer shall look exclusively to the RandW Insurance Policy for any and all
claims regarding any breaches of representations and warranties provided for
in this Agreement, and there shall be no further requirement of the Seller to
maintain all or any portion of the Escrowed Amount; provided, that if as of
the expiration of the Survival Period, the PropCo Buyer shall have provided a
Claim Notice to the Seller and commences a legal proceeding against the Seller
within sixty (60) days of delivery of such Claim Notice alleging that the
Seller is in breach of such Surviving Representation and that the PropCo
Buyer has suffered damages as a result thereof, then the Escrow Agent shall
retain, pursuant to the Transfer Sub Escrow Agreement, cash in an amount equal
to the lesser of (i) the amount claimed by the PropCo Buyer in such writing
and (ii) the then-remaining Escrowed Amount, pending resolution or settlement
of such claim. Except as set forth in Section 10.14, the aggregate liability
of the Seller to the PropCo Buyer in respect of all obligations for Surviving
Representation Damages under this Section 7.04 shall not exceed the Original
Escrowed Amount and the PropCo Buyer acknowledges and agrees that in no event
shall the Seller have any obligation or liability in connection with any
breach of the Surviving Representations in excess of the then-remaining
Escrowed Amount, and in the event that the Original Escrowed Amount is paid to
the PropCo Buyer on account of claims under this Section 7.04, then
this Section 7.04 shall be of no further force or effect. The Parties agree
to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Section 7.04 as an
adjustment to the Transfer Sub Membership Interests Purchase Price for all tax
purposes unless otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law. This Section
7.04 shall survive the Closing.

Encumbrance is monetary in nature, (ii) all such monetary Encumbrances
(together with any Permitted Encumbrances included in subsection (iii) of the

the terms of the Transaction Agreement.

 

Section 8.04 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither the PropCo Buyer

failure of such Party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement
or the Transaction Agreement.

 

Section 8.05 _Closings Contingent_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event the Membership Interest
Sale is not consummated following the Transfer Sub Membership Interests

binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither Party may assign its
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the
other Party, except that the PropCo Buyer may assign any and all of its rights

the sole benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or

intended third party beneficiaries of) the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.03_
(solely to the extent that it relates to the Debt Financing Parties), this

addition, the Seller agrees on behalf of itself and its affiliates that none
of the Debt Financing Parties shall have any liability or obligation to the
Seller or any of its affiliates relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions (including the Debt Financing) whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing shall limit (i) the PropCo Buyers obligations under
Section 6.19 of the Transaction Agreement or (ii) the rights of the Seller or
its affiliates pursuant to any existing financing arrangements of the Seller
or such affiliate with any of the Debt Financing Parties.

Section 10.09 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may only be

16

    

 in a manner that is materially adverse to the Debt Financing Parties without
the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Parties. No waiver by either
Party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly
set forth in writing and signed by the Party so waiving. No waiver by either
Party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure,
breach or default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of
a similar or different character, and whether occurring before or after that
waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy,
power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be

exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege.

 

Section 10.10 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial_. Subject to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 10.11_ hereof,
_Section_ __ _ 9.10_ of the Transaction Agreement shall apply to the Seller,
the PropCo Buyer and the Transfer Sub hereunder _mutatis mutandis_.

 

Section 10.11 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages or other legal remedies would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached by the Parties. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate
form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts  provided that,
solely to the extent necessary to enforce obligations hereunder related to the
transfer of real property as determined by the Chosen Courts, the PropCo Buyer
may pursue an action or proceeding in the state courts of the State of Ohio
and the federal courts of the United States of America located in Cuyahoga
County, Ohio  without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity subject to
_Section_ __ _ 8.03_ of the Transaction Agreement. Each Party agrees not to
raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance and further agrees not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach, subject to the provisions of _Section_
__ _ 9.11_ of the Transaction Agreement. Each Party further agrees that no
other Party nor any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post
any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_, and each
Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if, for any reason, the
OpCo Buyer shall fail to consummate the Membership Interest Sale, then (x) the
foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_ shall be void and of no
force or effect, and (y) the Seller shall not be entitled to specific
performance or any other equitable relief or remedy as against PropCo Buyer,
and the Sellers sole and exclusive remedy shall be as set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 8.03_ of the Transaction Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Seller acknowledges and agrees that in the event that the Buyers
timely pay the Termination Fee to the Seller, subject to and in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ of the Transaction Agreement, the Termination Fee
shall be the Sellers sole and exclusive remedy for the Buyers failure to
consummate the Membership Interest Sale and/or the Transfer Sub
Membership Interests Closing.

 



17

    

Section 10.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of
this Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an
original signed copy of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.13 _Payments and Revenues_. If, after the Closing, any Party
shall receive any payment, revenue or other amount that belongs to another
Party pursuant to this Agreement, such receiving Party shall promptly remit or
cause to be remitted such amount to the Party entitled to such amount.

 

Section 10.14 _Survival_. Except to the extent set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.04_, the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement or in any certificates or other documents delivered prior to or as
of the Closing shall survive the Closing as and to the extent set forth in the
Transaction Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the covenants and
agreements that by their terms are to be satisfied after the Closing Date
shall survive until satisfied in accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or prohibit the rights of the Buyers to pursue
recoveries under the RandW Insurance Policy or the rights and remedies of the
Buyers in the event of Fraud or Willful Breach on the part of Seller. 

Section 10.15 _PropCo Buyer_ __ _s and Transfer Sub_ __ _s Reliance on
its Investigations and Release_ The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.15_
shall survive the Transfer Sub Membership Interests Closing indefinitely and
shall not be deemed merged into any of the Closing documents.

 

(a) EACH OF THE PROPCO BUYER AND THE TRANSFER SUB ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES,
BY CONSUMMATING THE TRANSFER SUB MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS CLOSING, IT WILL BE
DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN A FULL OPPORTUNITY TO INSPECT AND INVESTIGATE EACH
AND EVERY ASPECT OF THE COMPANY REAL PROPERTY, EITHER INDEPENDENTLY OR THROUGH

SOLELY RELYING UPON ITS EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANY REAL PROPERTY AND IT IS
