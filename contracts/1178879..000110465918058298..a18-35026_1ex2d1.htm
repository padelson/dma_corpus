(b) _Surrender and Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, but no later than two (2) Business Days thereafter,
the Buyer will

 



      
 

 



 

instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each Company Holder (i) a letter of
transmittal, in the form set forth in _Exhibit F_, which will (I) specify
that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to any
Certificate(s) formerly representing Company Capital Stock will pass, only
upon receipt of such Certificate(s) by the Paying Agent and (II) contain the
release set forth in _Section 2.8(f)_ (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificate(s)
formerly representing all the Company Capital Stock held by such Company
Holder in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable to such Company
Holder. Such payment is conditioned upon (A) the due execution and delivery of
such Letter of Transmittal (including the release set forth in _Section
2.8(f)_), (B) a properly executed Form W-9 or Form W-8BEN (or W-8BEN-E) or
other applicable Form W-8, if applicable, from such holder in form and
substance acceptable to the Paying Agent and (C) any other documents as may be
reasonably requested by the Paying Agent. After the Effective Time, within
five (5) Business Days after receipt by the Paying Agent of Certificate(s),
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, formerly
representing all the Company Capital Stock held by any Company Holder for
cancellation, together with such duly executed Letter of Transmittal
(including the release set forth in _Section 2.8(f)_) and any other documents
as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent will, in
exchange therefor and in reliance on the representations and warranties herein
and therein, deliver to such Company Holder a check or wire transfer in the
amount that such Company Holder is entitled pursuant to the Allocation
Schedule.

 



 

(c) If payment of any portion of the applicable Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate(s) are registered, it will be a condition of payment that the
Person requesting such payment (i) will have paid any Taxes required by reason
of the payment of those amounts to a Person other than the registered holder
of the Certificate(s) surrendered, and will have established to the
satisfaction of the Buyer that such Taxes have been paid, or (ii) will have
established to the satisfaction of the Buyer that such Taxes are not
applicable. From and after the Effective Time, until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.8_, each Certificate formerly representing
Company Capital Stock will be deemed to represent for all purposes only the
right to receive the applicable consideration set forth in this _Article 2_,
if any, in respect of such interests formerly represented thereby in
accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following six (6) months
after the Effective Time, the Buyer will be entitled to require the Paying
Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any earnings received with respect
thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and that have not
been disbursed to the Company Holders and thereafter such holders will be
entitled to look only to the Buyer (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Legal Requirements) and only as general creditors thereof with
respect to such holders applicable payment, upon and subject to delivery of
the duly executed applicable Letter of Transmittal, as applicable, and, with
respect to any Company Holder, upon due surrender of their Certificates
formerly representing such interests, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent will be liable to any Company Holder for any amounts
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Legal Requirement.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate(s)
has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an
affidavit of that fact by the

 



      
 

 



 

holder thereof in form reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer or the Paying
Agent, the Buyer will cause to be paid to such holder the payment to which
such holder is entitled, as provided in this _Article 2_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Buyer may, in its sole discretion and as a condition
precedent to issuing such payment, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate(s) to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and a bond in such sum as the Buyer may
reasonably direct as indemnity, not to exceed the amount of the Company
Holders Merger Consideration, against any claim that may be made against the
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate(s) alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

(f) _Release_. Payment to any Company Holder in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement shall be conditioned upon due execution of the Letter of
Transmittal, which contains the following release:

 



 

"As of the effective time of the merger, I, on behalf of myself and each of my
affiliates, and all of my respective past and present agents, directors,

certificate of incorporation implemented in connection with the transactions

the fiduciary duties of Celenexs current or future board of directors or
stockholders), or (b) arising from, or relating to, during or in connection
with any time prior to and including the closing date of the merger out of any
events, acts or omissions relating to Celenex, in each case whether known or

consideration under the Merger Agreement, (ii) Claims arising from any rights
of

(a) By voting in favor of or consenting to the Merger or by surrendering or
delivering to the Paying Agent or the Company (or its designee payroll service
provider), as applicable, an executed Letter of Transmittal (including the

be paid in accordance with this Agreement, each Company Holder irrevocably
approves the depositing of the funds held in the Shareholders Representative
Fund and the constitution and appointment of, and hereby irrevocably
constitutes and appoints Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado

representative and attorney-in-fact of all Company Holders and each of them
(the " _Shareholders  Representative_") for all purposes and with respect to
any and all matters relating to, arising out of, or in connection with, this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, including for purposes of
taking any action or omitting to take any action on behalf of each Company
Holder hereunder to:

hereto;

 



 

(ii) receive and administer the Shareholders Representative Fund as set forth
herein;

 



 

(iii) do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the
Company Holders that the Shareholders Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in its discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
as fully and completely as the Company Holders could do if personally present;

 



 

(iv) administer the defense or settlement of any disputes regarding the

(vii) give any written direction to the Paying Agent;

 



      
 

 



 

(viii) give or receive notices to be given or received by the Company Holders
under this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto (except to the extent
that this Agreement or any agreements ancillary hereto expressly contemplate
that any such notice shall be given or received by each Company Holder
individually); and

 



 

(ix) receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto.

 



 

(b) All actions, notices, communications and determinations by or on behalf of
the Company Holders shall be given or made by the Shareholders Representative
and all such actions, notices, communications and determinations by the
Shareholders Representative shall conclusively be deemed to have been
authorized by, and shall be binding upon, any of and all Company Holders, and
no Company Holder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same. Without limiting the rights and obligations of the
Company, Buyer and Merger Sub under this Agreement, the Shareholders
Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the Estimated Closing
Statement, Allocation Schedule, the Transaction Expense Schedule, the Closing
Indebtedness Schedule and the CoC Payment Schedule, (ii) rely upon any
signature believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a
signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Company
Holder.

 



 

(c) The Shareholders Representative may resign at any time. If the
Shareholders Representative resigns, dies or becomes legally incapacitated,
then a majority of the Company Holders and the applicable recipients of the
Change of Control payments, based on their respective Pro Rata Percentages,
shall promptly designate in writing to Buyer a single Person to fill the
Shareholders Representative vacancy as the successor Shareholders
Representative hereunder. If at any time there shall not be a Shareholders
Representative or the Company Holders fail to designate a successor
Shareholders Representative, then Buyer may have a court of competent
jurisdiction appoint a Shareholders Representative hereunder. A majority of
the Company Holders and the applicable recipients of the Change of Control
payments, based on their respective Pro Rata Percentages, may also replace the
Person serving as the Shareholders Representative from time to time and for
any reason upon at least ten (10) days prior written notice to Buyer.

 



 

(d) The Shareholders Representative shall act for the Company Holders on all
of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the manner the Shareholders
Representative reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the Company
Holders. The Shareholders Representative is authorized to act on behalf of
the Company Holders notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among the
Company Holders. In taking any actions as Shareholders Representative, the
Shareholders Representative may rely conclusively, without any further
inquiry or investigation, upon any certification or confirmation, oral or
written, given by any Person the Shareholders Representative reasonably
believes to be authorized thereunto. The Shareholders Representative will
incur no liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by the
Shareholders Representative in connection with the Shareholders
Representatives services pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements
ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly resulting from the
Shareholders Representatives bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Shareholders Representative shall not be liable for any
action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Company Holders and

 



      
 

 



 

the applicable recipients of the Change of Control Payments (severally, and
not jointly, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages) will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Shareholders Representative from and
against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_
") arising out of or in connection with the Shareholders Representatives
execution and performance of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary
hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred;
provided, that in the event that any such Representative Loss is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Shareholders Representative, the Shareholders
Representative will reimburse the Company Holders the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such bad faith,
gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Shareholders Representative by the Company Holders, any such Representative
Losses may be recovered by the Shareholders Representative from (i) the funds
in the Shareholders Representative Fund, after payment of any amount required
pursuant to _Section 2.12(f)(iii)_, (ii) the amounts payable to the Company
Holders and the applicable recipients of the Change of Control Payments
pursuant to _Section 2.12(f)(ii)_ at such time as such amounts would
otherwise be distributable to the Company Holders and the applicable
recipients of the Change of Control Payments, (iii) the amounts in the Escrow
Account at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to
the Company Holders and the applicable recipients of the Change of Control
Payments and (iv) any Milestone Payments at such time as any such amounts
would otherwise be distributable to the Company Holders and the applicable
recipients of the Change of Control Payments; provided, that while this
section allows the Shareholders Representative to be paid from the
aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Company Holders
from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Shareholders Representative
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event
will the Shareholders Representative be required to advance its own funds on
behalf of the Company Holders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or
indemnification obligations of, or provisions limiting the recourse against
non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Company Holders set forth elsewhere
in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities
provided to the Shareholders Representative under this section. The foregoing
exculpation and indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or
removal of the Shareholders Representative or the termination of this
Agreement. Except for this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, the
Shareholders Representative has not entered into any Contract, arrangement or
understanding with the Company or any Company Holder, and the Company Holders
do not have any requirements, prerequisites or veto rights in connection with
the Shareholders Representatives fulfillment of its obligations or exercise
of its rights under this Agreement.

 



 

(e) The Shareholders Representative shall treat confidentially any nonpublic
information disclosed to it pursuant to this Agreement and shall not use such
nonpublic information other than in the performance of its duties as the
Shareholders Representative. In addition, the Shareholders Representative
shall not disclose any nonpublic information disclosed to it pursuant to this
Agreement to anyone except as required by Law; _provided_ that (i) the
Shareholders Representative may disclose such nonpublic information to
employees, legal

 



      
 

 



 

counsel, advisors, agents and consultants of the Shareholders Representative
and to the Company Holders, in each case who have a need to know such
information, provided that such persons are under an obligation of
confidentiality and non-use in its capacity as such and (ii) the Shareholders
Representative (or legal counsel or other advisor to whom information is
disclosed pursuant to clause (i) above) may disclose such nonpublic
information disclosed to the Shareholders Representative pursuant to this
Agreement in any Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (or, in either case, discussion in preparation therefor).

 



 

(f) Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the authority of the Shareholders
Representative as the agent, representative and attorney-in-fact of the
Company Holders for all purposes under this Agreement and shall have no
liability for any such reliance. No Company Holder may revoke the authority of
the Shareholders Representative except as set forth in _Section 2.9(b)_.
Each Company Holder, by voting in favor of or consenting to the Merger or by
surrendering or delivering a Certificate or an affidavit in lieu thereof to
the Paying Agent or the Company (or its designee payroll service provider), as
applicable, along with an executed Letter of Transmittal (including the
release set forth in _Section 2.8(f)_) hereby ratifies and confirms, and
hereby agrees to ratify and confirm, any action taken by the Shareholders
Representative in the exercise of the power-of-attorney granted to the
Shareholders Representative pursuant to this _Section 2.9_, which power-of-
attorney, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable and shall survive (i)
the death, bankruptcy, liquidation, incapacity or incompetence of such Company
Holder and (ii) the delivery of an assignment by any Company Holder of the
whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in any Milestone Payment.

 



 

(g) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay the Shareholders Representative Fund
Amount to the Shareholders Representative, which shall be maintained by the
Shareholders Representative in a segregated account (the aggregate amount of
cash so held by the Shareholders Representative from time to time, the "
_Shareholders  Representative Fund_"). The Shareholders Representative will
hold these funds separate from its funds, will not use these funds for its
operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily
make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The
Company Holders shall not receive interest or other earnings on the
Shareholders Representative Fund and the Company Holders irrevocably transfer
and assign to the Shareholders Representative any ownership right that they
may have in any interest or other earnings that may accrue on funds held in
the Shareholders Representative Fund. The Company Holders acknowledge that
the Shareholders Representative is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice. The Shareholders Representative shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Shareholders
Representative Fund other than as a result of its bad faith, gross negligence
or willful misconduct. For Tax purposes, the Shareholders Representative Fund
shall be treated in accordance with _Section 5.1(f)_. The Shareholders
Representative shall be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) pursuant to this
Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto from the Shareholders
Representative Fund; _provided_ that if the Shareholders Representative Fund
is insufficient to pay such expenses, then the Shareholders Representative
shall be paid or reimbursed directly from the Company Holders and the
applicable recipients of the Change of Control Payments on a several basis
(and not a joint and several basis) according to their respective Pro Rata
Percentages.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) Upon the determination of the Shareholders Representative that the
Shareholders Representative Fund is no longer necessary in connection with
defending claims for indemnification of the Shareholders Representative and
other post-Closing matters pursuant to this _Section 2.9_, the Shareholders
Representative shall deposit the remaining balance with the Paying Agent for
further distribution to the Company Holders and the applicable recipients of
the Change of Control Payments according to their respective Pro Rata
Percentages. The Paying Agent shall make payments to the Company Holders, the
applicable recipients of the Change of Control Payments and the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to the Allocation Schedule. Any portion of the
Shareholders Representative Fund that remains undeliverable or unclaimed
after six (6) months of the initial delivery attempt (or such earlier date,
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity by Law) shall become, to the extent
permitted by Law, including any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law,
the property of Buyer, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. The Shareholders Representative Fund shall not
be available to Buyer to satisfy any claims in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby. Any payments as may be required by
the Shareholders Representative to be made directly to it by any Company
Holder or recipient of a Change of Control Payment pursuant to this Agreement
or any other agreement shall be paid in accordance with such partys Pro Rata
Percentage.

 



 

(i) The Shareholders Representative represents and warrants to the Company,
Buyer and Merger Sub that (i) it has all requisite limited liability company
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder, (ii) the execution and delivery by the Shareholders
Representative of this Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary
limited liability company or similar action and no other proceedings are
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and (iii)
this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Shareholders
Representative and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
other Parties, constitutes a valid, legal and binding obligation of the
Shareholders Representative in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

 



 

Section 2.10 _Close of Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, no shares of
Company Capital Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding, and the holders of
shares of Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise
provided herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, shares of
Company Capital Stock are presented to the Paying Agent, Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article 2_.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a

 



      
 

 



 

holder of Company Capital Stock who: (i) voted against the Merger (if
submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders); (ii) did not consent in
writing to the Merger (if submitted for approval by written consent in lieu of
a meeting); or (iii) has not otherwise contractually waived its rights of
dissent and appraisal, and, in each case, who has exercised and perfected its
rights of dissent and appraisal for such shares in accordance with the Dissent
Statute and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such rights of dissent and
appraisal (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into or represent the right to consideration for Company Capital Stock set
forth in _Section 2.7_, but shall instead be converted into the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to any
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the Dissent Statute. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the Dissent Statute, becomes entitled to
payment thereunder for such shares shall receive payment therefor in
accordance with the Dissent Statute (but only after the value therefor shall
have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.11(a)_, if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect
or otherwise) such holders rights to dissent and appraisal under the Dissent
Statute, or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is
not entitled to relief provided under the Dissent Statute, then, as of the
later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders
shares of Company Capital Stock shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the consideration for Company Capital
Stock set forth in _Section 2.7_, without interest, following surrender of
the certificate representing such shares of Company Capital Stock in the
manner provided in _Section 2.8_ or, in the case of a lost, stolen,
mutilated, defaced or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of the documents,
if required, described in _Section 2.8_.

 



 

(c) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall give the
Shareholders Representative prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, negotiations between the Surviving Corporation and any holders of
Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any other related
instruments served on or by the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 2.12 _Closing Payment Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated Closing Statement_. Prior
to the date hereof, the Company prepared in good faith and provided to Buyer
an estimated balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (the "
_Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with a statement setting forth
in reasonable detail its good faith estimate of the estimated Closing
Indebtedness Amount, the estimated Closing Cash Amount, and the estimated
Seller Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ "). The
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement were
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

 



 

(b) _Estimated Closing Payment_. The amount of the Closing Payment has been
calculated using the estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount, the estimated
Closing Cash Amount, and the estimated Seller Transaction Expenses set forth
in the Estimated Closing Statement, which shall be subject to a "true-up"
adjustment after the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.12(f)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and Proposed Final Closing
Statement_. Not later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Shareholders
Representative, a balance sheet of the Company as of the close of business on
the date immediately preceding the Closing Date, (the " _Proposed Final
Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with a statement setting forth in
reasonable detail its proposed final determination of the Closing Indebtedness
Amount, the Closing Cash Amount, and the Seller Transaction Expenses (the "
_Proposed Final Closing Statement_ "). The Proposed Final Closing Balance
Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement will be prepared in accordance
with the Accounting Principles and in accordance with the definitions in this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any
calculations with respect to Taxes in the Estimated Closing Statement and the
Final Closing Statement shall be calculated as of the end of the day on the
Closing Date taking into account the effect of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Shareholders Representative and its Representatives
shall have reasonable access during reasonable business hours to the work
papers and other to the books, records (including work papers, schedules,
memoranda and other documents), supporting data, facilities and employees of
the Surviving Corporation for purposes of assisting the Shareholders
Representative and its Representatives in their review of the Proposed Final
Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement and the Buyer
shall cooperate with the Shareholders Representative and its Representatives
in good faith in connection with such review.

 



 

(d) _Dispute Notice_. The Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and the
Proposed Final Closing Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties unless the Shareholders Representative provides a written notice (a "
_Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer no later than the twentieth (20th) Business Day
after the delivery to the Shareholders Representative of the Proposed Final
Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement. Any Dispute
Notice must set forth in reasonable detail (i) any item on the Proposed Final
Closing Balance Sheet or the Proposed Final Closing Statement which the
Shareholders Representative believes has not been prepared in accordance with
this Agreement and the correct amount of such item and (ii) the Shareholders
Representatives alternative calculation of the Closing Indebtedness Amount,
the Closing Cash Amount, and the Seller Transaction Expenses, as applicable.
For the avoidance of doubt, any item not included in the Dispute Notice shall
be considered final and binding.

 



 

(e) _Resolution of Disputes_. Buyer and Shareholders Representative will
attempt to promptly resolve the matters raised in any Dispute Notice in good
faith. If Buyer and Shareholders Representative have not resolved the matters
raised in any Dispute Notice, within ten (10) Business Days after the date of
delivery of any Dispute Notice pursuant to _Section 2.12(d)_ either Buyer or
Shareholders Representative may provide written notice to the other (the "
_Dispute Submission Notice_ ") that it elects to submit the disputed items to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or another nationally recognized independent
accounting firm chosen jointly by Buyer and the Shareholders Representative
(the " _Accounting Firm_ "). In the event that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has
not agreed to act as the Accounting Firm and an alternative Accounting Firm
has not been selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and the Shareholders
Representative within ten (10) Business Days following the giving of the
Dispute Submission Notice, each of Buyer and the Shareholders Representative
shall promptly select an accounting firm and promptly cause such two
accounting firms to mutually select a third

 



       
 

 



 

independent accounting firm to act as the Accounting Firm within twenty (20)
Business Days of the giving of the Dispute Submission Notice. The Accounting
Firm will act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on presentations by
Buyer and the Shareholders Representative (and including the opportunity for
each of the Buyer and the Shareholders Representative to comment upon the
presentations of the other), and not by independent review, only those
unresolved items and amounts specifically set forth and objected to in the
Dispute Notice, and resolve the dispute with respect to each such specific
unresolved item and amount in accordance with this Agreement. In any such
case, a single partner of the Accounting Firm selected by such Accounting Firm
in accordance with its normal procedures and having expertise with respect to
settlement of such disputes and the industry in which the Surviving
Corporation operates shall act for the Accounting Firm in the determination
proceeding, and the Accounting Firm shall render a written decision as to each
disputed matter, including a statement in reasonable detail of the basis for
its decision. In no event shall the decision of the Accounting Firm provide
for a calculation of the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Closing Cash Amount
or the Seller Transaction Expenses that is less than the calculation thereof
shown in the Proposed Final Closing Statement or greater than the
Shareholders Representatives alternative calculation thereof shown in the
Dispute Notice. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne
equally by Buyer and the Shareholders Representative (on behalf of the
Company Holders). The decision of the Accounting Firm with respect to the
disputed items of the Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed
Final Closing Statement submitted to it will be final, conclusive and binding
on the Parties. As used herein, the Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and
the Proposed Final Closing Statement, as adjusted to reflect any changes
agreed to by the Parties and the decision of the Accounting Firm, in each
case, pursuant to this _Section 2.12(e)_, are referred to herein as the "
_Final Closing Balance Sheet_ " and the " _Final Closing Statement_ ",
respectively. Each of the Parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Accounting Firm (including by executing a
customary engagement letter reasonably acceptable to it) and to cause the
Accounting Firm to resolve any such dispute as soon as practicable after the
commencement of the Accounting Firms engagement, and in any event within
thirty (30) days after submission of the matter to the Accounting Firm.

 



 

(f) _Closing Payment Adjustment_. If any of the Closing Indebtedness Amount,
the Closing Cash Amount or the Seller Transaction Expenses (as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ and as set forth in the Final
Closing Statement) differs from the estimated amount thereof set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement, the following shall occur:

 



 

(i) the Closing Payment shall be recalculated using the Closing Indebtedness
Amount, the Closing Cash Amount or the Seller Transaction Expenses, as
applicable, in the Final Closing Statement in lieu of the Closing Indebtedness
Amount, the Closing Cash Amount or the Seller Transaction Expenses (which
adjustment shall take into account any recalculations to the Closing
Indebtedness Amount or the Closing Cash Amount), as applicable, in the
Estimated Closing Statement (such recalculated Closing Payment, the " _Final
Closing Payment_ ");

 



 

(ii) if the Final Closing Payment exceeds the Closing Payment paid at Closing,
Buyer shall, within five (5) Business Days, deliver or cause to be delivered
to the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
amount of such excess for further disbursement to the Company Holders and the
applicable recipients of

 



      
 

 



 

the Change of Control Payments ( _pro rata_ in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Percentages as set forth on the Allocation Schedule); or

 



 

(iii) if the Final Closing Payment is less than the Closing Payment paid at
Closing (such shortfall, the " _Overpayment Amount_ "), (A) Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to, within five
(5) Business Days, remit the first $1,000,000 of the Overpayment Amount (or if
the Overpayment Amount is less than $1,000,000, the entire amount of the
Overpayment Amount) from the amount available in the Escrow Account, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by Buyer and
(B) if the Overpayment Amount is greater than $1,000,000, at Buyers option
(1) Buyer and the Shareholders Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent
to, within five (5) Business Days, remit all or a portion of the Overpayment
Amount in excess of $1,000,000 from the amount available in the Escrow
Account, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by Buyer, (2) Buyer may apply set-off in respect of all or a
portion of the Overpayment Amount in excess of $1,000,000 pursuant to _Section
6.6_ or (3) a combination of clauses (1) and (2).

 



 

Section 2.13 _Milestone Payments_.

 



 

(a) _Development Milestones_. Buyer shall make the payments described in Table
1 below (each, a " _Development Milestone Payment_ "), after deducting the
amount payable in connection therewith to RBC as provided in _Section
2.13(a)(ii)_ below, following first achievement or first occurrence by the
Company, its Affiliates, or a Rights Transferee of the corresponding event
with respect to the indicated Milestone Product (each a " _Development
Milestone Event_ ") described in the row to the left of such payment in Table
1.

(i) In no event shall any of the Development Milestone Payments be paid more
than once.

 



 

(ii) The Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, written notice to the
Shareholders Representative of the achievement of any Development Milestone
Event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the occurrence thereof, and,
within ten (10) Business Days of the delivery of such notice, the Buyer shall
pay to the Paying Agent, for further disbursement to the Company Holders and
the applicable recipients of the Change of Control Payments (pro rata in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages, as set forth on the
Allocation Schedule), the applicable Development Milestone Payment, net of any
amounts payable by the Company to RBC in respect of such Development Milestone
Payment pursuant to the RBC Agreement as determined in good faith by the
Company (which amounts shall be paid by Buyer to RBC). Each such payment will
be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Paying Agent
for further disbursement to the Company Holders and the applicable recipients
of the Change of Control Payments.

 



 

(b) _Commercial Milestone Payments_. Buyer shall make the payments described
in Table 2 below (each, a " _Sales Milestone Payment_ "), after deducting the
amount payable in connection therewith to RBC as provided in _Section
2.13(b)(iii)_ below with respect to Milestone Products when annual worldwide
Net Sales of the Milestone Products by the Company, its Affiliates, or its
Rights Transferees in a given calendar year first exceed the indicated dollar
value (each a " _Sales Milestone Event_ ").

(i) If one or more Priority Review Vouchers has been granted with respect to
any Milestone Product candidate (a " _PRV Milestone Event_ " and together with
the Sales Milestone Events, the " _Commercial Milestone Events_ "), then with
respect to each such Priority Review Voucher, (A) upon the sale of such
Priority Review Voucher to a Third Party, Buyer shall pay an aggregate amount
equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Net PRV Proceeds from such sale or (B)
should Buyer or its Affiliates elect to use such Priority Review Voucher
rather than sell or transfer it to a Third Party, Buyer shall pay an amount
equal to fifty percent (50%) of the average value of the last three (3)
publicly disclosed priority review voucher sales at the time of use;
_provided_ , that, in the event that Buyer shall have publicly marketed such
Priority Review Voucher for sale in good faith, the amount determined pursuant
to the preceding clause (B) shall be fifty percent (50%) of the average value
of the last three (3) publicly disclosed priority review voucher sales at the
time of use and the highest bona-fide written offer received from a potential
buyer of the Priority Review Voucher; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the
event that such marketing period commences more than twelve (12) months after
the last publicly disclosed priority review voucher sale, the amount
determined pursuant to the preceding clause (B) shall be the highest bona-fide
written offer received from a potential buyer of the Priority Review Voucher
(in the event of (A) or (B), the " _PRV Milestone Payment_ " and together with
the Sales Milestone Payments, the " _Commercial Milestone Payments_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, Buyers inability to sell or use the PRV, including as
a result of Legal Requirements, shall not give rise to any PRV Milestone
Payment.

 



 

(ii) Each Sales Milestone Payment is payable only once, regardless of the
number of times the Milestone Products achieve the corresponding Sales
Milestone Event.

 



 

(iii) The Buyer shall pay to the Paying Agent for further disbursement to the
Company Holders and the applicable recipients of the Change of Control
Payments (pro rata in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages,
as set forth on the Allocation Schedule), the applicable Commercial Milestone
Payment, net of any amounts payable by the Company to RBC in respect of such
Commercial Milestone Payment pursuant to the RBC Agreement as determined in
good faith by the Company (which amounts shall be paid by Buyer to RBC), as
promptly as practicable and in no event more than ten (10) Business Days
following the delivery of the Net Sales Report indicating that such Commercial
Milestone Event has been achieved (or, if applicable, no later than ten (10)
Business Days following the delivery by the Accounting Firm of an audit report

 



      
 

 



 

containing a final determination of the Accounting Firm). Each such payment
will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Paying
Agent for further disbursement to the Company Holders and the applicable
recipients of the Change of Control Payments.

 



 

(iv) If more than one Commercial Milestone Event described in this _Section
2.13(b)_ is achieved during the same calendar year, the Buyer shall pay each
Commercial Milestone Payment that corresponds to such Commercial Milestone
Events.

 



 

Section 2.14 _Net Sales Reporting and Audit Rights_.

 



 

(a) Written Report and Audit Rights _._

 



 

(i) Until [***] (the " _Reporting Period_ "), Buyer will provide the
Shareholders Representative with a written report within ninety (90) days
after the conclusion of each calendar year setting forth the aggregate Net
Sales of the Milestone Products during the preceding calendar year (the " _Net
Sales Report_ "); _provided_ that the reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents filed or furnished by Buyer with or to the SEC shall be
deemed to satisfy this reporting obligation if such information is disclosed
therein. If the Buyer determines that a Commercial Milestone Event has been
achieved during any calendar year, the Buyer shall include a notice in the Net
Sales Report that such Commercial Milestone Event has been achieved. The Buyer
shall keep (and shall cause its Affiliates, including the Surviving
Corporation to keep), for so long as required under Buyers internal records
retention policies, books and records pertaining to the Net Sales of the
Milestone Product with respect to each calendar year.

 



 

(ii) During the Reporting Period and for a period of one (1) year thereafter,
the Shareholders Representative (on behalf of the Company Holders) may engage
the Accounting Firm to review Buyers books and records pertaining to the Net
Sales of the Milestone Product for the purposes of confirming whether a
Commercial Milestone Payment has been achieved for the prior calendar year and
the Buyers compliance with the Commercial Milestone Payments provisions of
this Agreement, in accordance with the other provisions of this _Section
2.14_.

 



 

(iii) No earlier than forty-five (45) days following the Shareholders
Representatives request of an audit pursuant to this _Section 2.14_, Buyer
shall afford the Accounting Firm reasonable access to and an opportunity to
examine such books and records of the Buyer as it reasonably requests, during
regular business hours, in a manner designed to avoid disruption to the
Buyers business and subject to execution and delivery to Buyer of a
confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to Buyer for the sole purpose
of determining compliance with the Commercial Milestone Payments provisions of
this Agreement.

 



 

(iv) Each of the Shareholders Representative and the Buyer will be entitled
to receive (substantially simultaneously) a full written report of the
Accounting Firm with respect to its findings directly from the Accounting
Firm.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) The Shareholders Representative (on behalf of the Company Holders) will
bear the full cost of such audit, unless such audit discloses that a
Commercial Milestone Event was achieved but not reported by the Buyer, in
which case, the Buyer shall bear the reasonable cost of the Accounting Firm
for such audit not to exceed $50,000.

 



 

(vi) In the event of any dispute between the Shareholders Representative and
Buyer regarding the findings of an audit under this _Section 2.14(a)_, the
Shareholders Representative and Buyer will initially attempt in good faith to
resolve the dispute amicably between themselves, and if the Shareholders
Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve such dispute within thirty (30)
days after delivery to both of them of the Accounting Firms report, Buyer
will select, subject to the Shareholders Representatives consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, an
internationally recognized independent certified public accounting firm (other
than the Accounting Firm) to resolve such dispute. Such accounting firm shall
act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on presentations by Buyer and
the Shareholders Representative (and including the opportunity for each of
the Buyer and the Shareholders Representative to comment upon the
presentations of the other), and not by independent review, only those items
in dispute. Such accounting firms determination will be binding on both
Parties absent manifest error by such accounting firm.

 



 

(vii) The Shareholders Representatives exercise of its audit rights under
this _Section 2.14_ may not (A) be conducted with respect to any calendar
year more than two (2) years after the end of such calendar year, (B) be
conducted more than once in any twenty-four (24) month period (unless a
previous audit during such twelve (12) month period revealed a material
underpayment with respect to such period), or (C) be repeated for any calendar
year.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing, by execution of this Agreement, Buyer agrees that
it, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates and transferees shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to develop and commercialize the Milestone
Products.

 



 

(c) After the Closing, no Company Holder or applicable recipient of a Change
of Control Payment may sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of his,
her or its right to receive any portion of any Milestone Payment that becomes
due and payable in accordance with this _Section 2.14_, other than (i) upon
death by will or intestacy; (ii) by instrument to an inter vivos or
testamentary trust in which the right to receive the Milestone Payment or

contemplated hereby or be reasonably expected to have the effect of
preventing, delaying, making illegal or otherwise interfering with any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 **ARTICLE 5**

 



 

 **CERTAIN COVENANTS**

 



 

Section 5.1 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
borne by the Company Holders. The party responsible under applicable Law for
filing any Tax Return with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall timely file
such Tax Return and, if required by applicable Law, the other party will join
in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. Buyer and
the Shareholders Representative shall have the right to review such Tax
Returns prior to filing and provide comments with respect thereto. The filing
party shall incorporate any reasonable comments received from the other party
with respect to such Tax Returns.

 



 

(b) To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, the taxable year of the
Company shall terminate as of the end of the day on the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) For purposes of allocating Taxes for a Straddle Period, the portion of
such Tax which relates to the portion of such Tax Period ending on the Closing
Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or
measured by income or receipts, sales or use Taxes, transfer or transaction-
based Taxes, employment or payroll Taxes, or withholding Taxes of the Company
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax Period multiplied by
a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Tax Period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or
measured by income or receipts, sales or use Taxes, transfer or transaction-
based Taxes, employment or payroll Taxes, or withholding Taxes of the Company,
be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax
Period ended on the Closing Date based on an interim closing of the books as
of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the Tax
Period of any partnership or other pass-through entity or any "controlled
foreign corporation" (within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code) or
"passive foreign investment company" (within the meaning of Section 1297 of
the Code) in which the Company holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to
terminate at such time). Exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall
be apportioned on a daily basis and Taxes that are computed on a periodic
basis, such as property Taxes, shall also be apportioned on a daily basis. Any
income, gain, deduction or loss attributable to transactions outside of the
ordinary course of business by the Buyer (or its Affiliates) on the Closing
Date after the Closing shall be allocated to the post-Closing Taxable period.

 



 

(d) _Shareholders  Representative Fund_. The Shareholders Representative
Fund Amount deposited by the Paying Agent into the Shareholders
Representative Fund shall be treated as having been received and voluntarily
set aside by the Company Holders at the time of Closing (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, Tax withholding with respect to such deemed contribution
by any Company Holder shall be satisfied from such Company Holders share of
the Closing Payment and shall not reduce the Shareholders Representative
Fund).

 



 

(e) _Refunds or Credits_. Except to the extent taken into account in the
determination of Indebtedness, Buyer shall promptly remit to the Paying Agent
(for further distribution to the Company Holders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Capital Stock Percentages) any refunds or credits of Taxes
received by Buyer or the Company: (i) relating to the Company for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or portions of a Straddle Period (described in _Section
5.1(c)_) ending on or before the Closing Date; or (ii) attributable to an
amount paid by the Company Holders or for which the Company Holders are
responsible under this Agreement. Buyer shall be entitled to all other refunds
and credits of Taxes.

 



 

(f) _Tax Returns_. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and cause to be
filed in a timely manner all Tax Returns with respect to the Company for (i)
all Tax Periods ending on or before the Closing Date that have not been filed
as of the Closing Date and (ii) all Straddle Periods. Such Tax Returns shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with the Companys prior practice. At least
thirty (30) days prior to the filing of each such Tax Return, Buyer shall
provide the Tax Return to the Shareholders Representative for its review and
comment and shall incorporate any reasonable comments to such Tax Return. The
Company Holders shall be responsible for payment of any Taxes for (A) any Pre-
Closing Tax Periods and (B) the portion of

 



       
 

 



 

any Straddle Period allocated to the pre-closing period under _Section
5.1(c)_, in each case to the extent such Taxes were not included in the
calculation of Indebtedness.

 



 

(g) _Cooperation_. Buyer and the Shareholders Representative shall cooperate
fully with each other and with each Partys accounting firms and legal
counsel, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 5.1_ and
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes or pertaining
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative further agree, upon request, to use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Taxing Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce
or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to,
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

(h) _Contests_. Whenever any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an
assessment, or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which the Company
Holders are liable under this Agreement, Buyer shall upon receipt of such
assertion, promptly, but no later than fifteen (15) days after such receipt,
inform the Shareholders Representative in writing of such assertion. The
Buyer shall control any resulting proceedings and determine whether and when
to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) the Shareholders Representative shall be permitted to participate (at the
Company Holders expense) to the extent such proceedings or determinations
affect the amount of Taxes for which the Company Holders may be required to
indemnify Buyer under this Agreement and (ii) the Buyer shall not settle any
such claim, assessment or dispute without the Shareholders Representatives
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Whenever any Governmental Entity asserts a claim, makes an assessment or
otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which both the Company and Buyer
may be liable: (i) each Party may participate in any resulting proceedings at
its own expense; (ii) that portion of the proceedings shall be controlled by
that Party which would bear the burden of the greater portion of the sum of
the adjustment and any corresponding adjustments; and (iii) the controlling
Party shall not settle any such claim, assessment or dispute without the
consent of the non-controlling Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(i) _Tax Indemnification_. Company Holders shall be liable for, and shall
indemnify and hold Buyer, the Company and Buyers Affiliates harmless against
(without duplication), all Losses and Taxes suffered by Buyer, the Company and
Buyers Affiliates arising out of, incident to, or as a result of: (i) the
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in _Section
3.14_; (ii) any breach of any covenant contained in this _Section 5.1_; (iii)
Taxes of or attributable to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods, to
the extent not included in the definition of Indebtedness; and (iv) Taxes
payable by the Company in any period by reason of the Company being severally
liable for the Tax of any Person pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or any analogous foreign, state or local Tax law in any Pre-Closing
Tax Period. The Escrow Account and Buyers right of set-off described in
_Section 6.6_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for Losses and Taxes
suffered by Buyer, the Company and Buyers Affiliates pursuant to this
_Section 5.1(i)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(j) _Tax Effect of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnity payments made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for all Tax purposes as
adjustments to the Final Closing Payment, unless required otherwise by
applicable Law.

 



 

(k) _Survival of Obligations and Sole Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the obligations of the Parties set forth in this
_Section 5.1_ shall be unconditional and absolute, shall survive until ninety
(90) days after the expiration of the applicable statutory reassessment or
appeal periods for the Taxes in question, having regard, without limitation to
(i) any waiver given by the Company in respect of the Taxes in question and
(ii) any entitlement of a Taxing Authority to assess or reassess the Company
without limitation in the event of fraud or misrepresentation attributable to
neglect, carelessness or willful default.

Agreement and pursuant to any indemnity agreements between the Company and
such Person as in effect on the date of this Agreement and set forth in

of six (6) years from the Effective Time, on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable than the Companys existing policy or,
if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best
available coverage.

 



 

(c) This _Section 5.2_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the
Effective Time, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the DandO
Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of

of the Company, Buyer and Merger Sub shall bear its own fees and expenses
incurred or owed in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that (a) the Company Holders and
the applicable recipients of the Change of Control Payments shall bear

accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

the terms of _Section 2.9_ and (ii) the Escrow Agent and (b) Buyer shall bear
all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

of any representation or warranty made by the Company in _Article 3_ or (iii)

Section 6.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Any Buyer Indemnified Person seeking any indemnification under _Section
6.2_ acting through Buyer shall give the Shareholders Representative prompt
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") of any matter which such Buyer Indemnified
Person has determined has given or could give rise to a right of
indemnification under _Section 6.2_; _provided_ , _however_ , if a Buyer
Indemnified Person shall receive written notice of any third party claim
(other than any claim relating to Taxes, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which such
Buyer Indemnified Person believes may result in a demand for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 6.2_, the Buyer Indemnified Person, acting through
Buyer, shall give the Shareholders Representative a Claim Notice within ten
(10) Business Days after receipt by the Buyer Indemnified Person of such
notice. The Claim Notice shall (i) indicate whether the Indemnity Claim
results from or arises out of a Third Party Claim or a direct claim, (ii)
describe with reasonable specificity the nature of the Indemnity Claim and
(iii) state the amount of Losses sought pursuant to such Indemnity Claim to
the extent then known. The failure to deliver or timely deliver the Claim
Notice shall not affect the rights of the Buyer Indemnified Person to
indemnification under _Section 6.2_, except and only to the extent that the
Company Indemnifying Persons shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced by reason of such failure. The Company Holders may only make claims
for indemnification under _Section 6.2(g)_ through the Shareholders
Representative.

 



 

(b) _Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(i) The Shareholders Representative (on behalf of the Company Indemnifying
Person) shall have the right to conduct at the Company Indemnifying Persons
expense the defense of a Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer Indemnified Person, upon delivery of notice to the
applicable Buyer Indemnified Person (the " _Defense Notice_ ") within ten (10)
days after the Shareholders Representatives receipt of the Claim Notice;
_provided_ that the Defense Notice shall specify the counsel the Shareholders
Representative will appoint to defend such Third Party Claim and acknowledge
the right of such Buyer Indemnified Person to be indemnified for Losses
incurred in connection with such Third Party Claim. The applicable Buyer
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to be indemnified for the

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for any period during which the
Shareholders Representative has not assumed the defense of any such Third
Party Claim in accordance herewith to the extent such fees and expenses
constitute Losses subject to indemnification hereunder. If the Shareholders
Representative delivers a Defense Notice and thereby elects to conduct the
defense of the Third Party Claim, such Buyer Indemnified Person will cooperate
with and make available to the Shareholders Representative such assistance
and materials as the Shareholders Representative may reasonably request, all
at the sole expense of the Company Indemnifying Persons, and the Buyer
Indemnified Person shall have the right at its expense to participate in the
defense assisted by counsel of its own choosing.

 



 

(ii) The Shareholders Representative shall not be entitled to control the
defense of any Third Party Claim if (i) such Indemnity Claim is with respect
to an Action (A) by a Governmental Entity, (B) regarding material Company
Intellectual Property, or (C) that could result in a Material Adverse Effect
on the Surviving Corporation, (ii) the applicable Buyer Indemnified Person has
been advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a material
conflict of interest between the Company Indemnifying Persons and such Buyer
Indemnified Person with respect to such Third Party Claim, (iii) the
Shareholders Representative has failed to deliver the Defense Notice or is
failing to adequately prosecute or defend such Third Party Claim, (iv) such
Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against such
Buyer Indemnified Person or (v) the amount of such Indemnity Claim exceeds the
Indemnity Cap Amount. In the event of any of the foregoing circumstances and
the Buyer Indemnified Person has nonetheless permitted the Shareholders
Representative to control the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Buyer
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, at the expense
of the Company Indemnifying Persons.

 



 

(iii) The Shareholders Representative shall not, without the prior written
consent of the applicable Buyer Indemnified Person: (A) settle or compromise a
Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any Action which does not include
an unconditional, duly authorized, fully executed and acknowledged (by a duly
registered notary public) written release by the claimant or plaintiff of such
Buyer Indemnified Person from all liability in respect of the Third Party
Claim; (B) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim if the settlement
imposes equitable remedies or other obligations on such Buyer Indemnified
Person; or (C) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim if the result is to
admit civil or criminal liability or culpability on the part of such Buyer
Indemnified Person that could give rise to criminal liability with respect to
such Buyer Indemnified Person. No Third Party Claim which is being defended by
the Shareholders Representative in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement shall be settled or compromised by such Buyer Indemnified Person
without the prior written consent of the Shareholders Representative (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

Section 6.5 _No Right of Contribution_. Neither the Shareholders
Representative nor any Company Indemnifying Person shall make any claim for
contribution from the Surviving Corporation with respect to any indemnity
claims arising under or in connection with this Agreement to the extent that
the Surviving Corporation or any Buyer Indemnified Person is

 



      
 

 



 

entitled to indemnification hereunder for such claim, and the Shareholders
Representative, on its own behalf and on behalf of all Company Indemnifying
Persons, hereby waives any such right of contribution from the Surviving
Corporation it has or may have in the future.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Set-Off_. Buyer and the Company Holders hereby expressly
acknowledge and agree, and the applicable recipients of the Change of Control
Payments have expressly acknowledged and agreed, that Buyer shall have the
right [***].

 



 

Section 6.7 _Alternative Reimbursement_. The amount of any Losses subject to
indemnification under _Section 6.2_ shall be calculated net of any insurance
proceeds, indemnity, contribution or other payment actually recovered by the
Buyer Indemnified Person or Company Indemnified Person from any third party
with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) no Buyer Indemnified
Person shall be required to pursue insurance or other collateral sources to
offset such Losses, except that a Buyer Indemnified Person shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to avail itself of available insurance
policies to the same extent as it would if such Losses were not subject to
indemnification hereunder, and (b) the amount of such recovery shall be
reduced by any reasonable and documented third-party costs and expenses
incurred in obtaining such recovery and by the amount of any increase in
insurance premiums resulting from making the claim giving rise to such
recovery. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any
Buyer Indemnified Person or Company Indemnified Person with respect to any
Losses for which any such Buyer Indemnified Person or Company Indemnified
Person has been indemnified hereunder, then the Buyer Indemnified Person or
Company Indemnified Person, as applicable, shall promptly pay to the Company
Indemnifying Person or Buyer, as applicable, the amount of such recovery, but
in no event shall the amount of such payment to the Company Indemnifying
Person or Buyer, as applicable, exceed the amount of the indemnification
payment made to the Buyer Indemnified Person or Company Indemnified Person, as
applicable.

Section 7.3 _Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) Each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Chancery Court, and any federal court of the United States of America
sitting in the State of Delaware, for the purposes of any suit, action or
other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby. Each Party agrees to commence any such action, suit or proceeding
either in the Delaware Chancery Court or if such suit, action or other
proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional reasons, in any
federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware. Each Party further agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by the U.S. registered mail to such Partys respective
address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action,
suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has
submitted to jurisdiction in this _Section 7.3_. Each Party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in (i) the Delaware Chancery Court, and (ii) any federal
court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware, and
hereby and thereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees
not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. This _Section 7.3_ shall not apply to any dispute under _Section
2.12_ or _Section 2.14_ that is required to be decided by the Accounting
Firm.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT. Each
Party hereto (i) certifies that no Representative of any other Party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such Party would not, in the event
of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and
(ii) acknowledges that it and the other Parties hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this _Section 7.3_.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Amendment and Waiver_.

 



 

(a) No failure or delay on the part of any Party in exercising any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, this
Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time, whether before or after
the Shareholder Approval has been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
after the Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no
amendment that by Law requires further approval by stockholders of either
Party, without the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may
not be amended, supplemented or modified except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the Parties; _provided_ that, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, Buyer and the Shareholders Representative may
cause this Agreement to be amended at any time after the Closing by execution
of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of Buyer and the Shareholders
Representative. In the case of a waiver, such waiver shall be effective only
if it is

 



       
 

 



 

made or given in writing and signed by the Party granting the waiver and shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which made or given.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with all annexes,
schedules (including the Disclosure Schedule) and exhibits and all ancillary
agreements, documents or instruments to be delivered in connection herewith
and therewith, contain the entire agreement and understanding between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede
all prior discussions, negotiations, commitments, agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, relating to such subject matter.

 



 

Section 7.6 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section 5.2_, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and
their permitted successors and assigns and nothing herein expressed or implied
shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the Parties and
such successors and assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when
so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile, .pdf or other electronically transmitted signatures and such
signatures shall be deemed to bind each Party hereto as if they were the
original signatures.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Governing Law_. Except as set forth in _Section 2.12(e)_ or
_Section 2.14_ with respect to resolution of certain disputes by the
Accounting Firm, this Agreement and all matters relating to or arising out of
this Agreement (whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise) shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflict of laws thereof or of any other jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that
irreparable damage would occur (for which monetary relief, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy) in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed by Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company, as
applicable, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
by Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, including if the Parties
fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that (a)
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance, or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
by any of Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof against Buyer, Merger Sub or the
Company, as applicable, in any court having jurisdiction, without proof of
damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the
Parties are entitled at law or in equity and (ii) the right of specific
performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor
Buyer would have entered into this Agreement. The Parties agree not to assert
that a remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and not
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
or that the Parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The Parties
acknowledge

 



      
 

 



 

and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 7.9_ shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no
event shall this _Section 7.9_, be used, alone or together with any other
provision of this Agreement, to require the Company to remedy any breach of
any representation or warranty of the Company made herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, _Article 6_ shall govern with respect to indemnity claims and this
_Section 7.9_ is subject to _Section 6.2(d)_.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Representation_. Each of the Parties hereby agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers, employees
and Affiliates, that Fenwick and West LLP may serve as counsel to each and any
of the Shareholders Representative, the Company Holders and their respective
Affiliates (individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ "), on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Fenwick and West LLP (or any successor) may
serve as counsel to the Seller Group or any director, member, partner,
officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such
representation of the Company, and each of the Parties hereby consents thereto
and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any Affiliate
thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such
representation. Upon and after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall
cease to have any future attorney-client relationship with Fenwick and West LLP,
unless and to the extent Fenwick and West LLP is specifically engaged in writing
by the Surviving Corporation to represent the Surviving Corporation after the
Closing and either such engagement involves no conflict of interest with
respect to the Company Holders or the Shareholders Representative consents in
writing at the time to such engagement. The Parties agree to take the
commercially reasonable steps necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching
as a result of Fenwick and West LLP representing the Company in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall survive the Closing and
shall remain in effect; _provided_ that such privilege from and after the
Closing shall be controlled by the Shareholders Representative. As to any
privileged attorney-client communications between Fenwick and West LLP and the
Company prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Privileged
Communications_ "), each of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company, together with
any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, agree
that no such party may use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in
any action against or involving any of the parties after the Closing;
_provided_ that the foregoing does not waive or excuse Fenwick and West LLP from
complying with all applicable rules of professional conduct regarding the
confidentiality of any client information of the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a dispute arises between Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation), on the one hand, and a third party
other than (and unaffiliated with) the Company Holders and the Shareholders
Representative, on the other hand, after the Closing, then Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) may assert such attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure to such third party of confidential
communications by Fenwick and West LLP; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer and
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) may

 



      
 

 



 

not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Shareholders Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

Section 7.11 _Investigation._

 



 

(a) Buyer acknowledges that the detailed representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement have been negotiated at arms length among
sophisticated business entities. Buyer has conducted its own independent
review and analysis of, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the business, assets, condition, operations and prospects of the
Company.

 



 

(b) Buyer further agrees that, except in the case of Fraud, neither the
Company nor any other Person shall have or be subject to any liability to
Buyer or any of its Affiliates resulting from the distribution to Buyer, or
Buyers use, of any information, including any information, document or
material made available or provided to Buyer in certain "data rooms,"
management presentations, offering or information memoranda or any other form
in expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for the sole
and exclusive remedies of Buyer set forth herein.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with
Buyers investigation of the Company and the Business, Buyer has received from
or on behalf of the Company certain projections, including projected
statements of operating revenues and income from operations of their business
and certain business plan information for such fiscal years. Buyer
acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar
with such uncertainties, that, except in the case of Fraud on behalf of the
Company or any of its Representatives or Affiliates, Buyer is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections and forecasts), and that, Buyer shall not have any claim against
the Company or any Person, with respect to such information, except in the
case of Fraud on behalf of the Company or any of its Representatives or
Affiliates.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

 



 

Section 7.13 _Termination by Buyer_. In the event that the Company does not
deliver the Written Consents as contemplated by _Section 5.7_ by the
Termination Time, Buyer shall have the right, by providing written notice to
the Company, to terminate this Agreement. If the Agreement is terminated
pursuant to this _Section 7.13_, all obligations of the parties under this
Agreement will terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that termination of this
Agreement will not relieve the

 



      
 

 



 

Company from any liabilities, losses, damages, obligations, costs or expenses
relating to the Companys breach of _Section 5.7_.

 



 

 _[Signature pages follow.]_

 



      
 

 



 

In Witness Whereof, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be signed by
their duly authorized representatives as of the date first written above.
