as to prevent any  commissions and fees which are earned in one year (as opposed

of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  that are  included in the  calculation  of
Tangible  Net  Worth of  Company  and its  Subsidiaries  and HIRAC  pursuant  to
Sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2;  provided that to the extent the severance,  retention
and bonus  obligations  as set forth in Section 2.3.2 of the Company  Disclosure
Letter are not paid at or prior to Closing, then any charge against Buyer's GAAP
earnings in excess of $1,000,000  as a result of making such payments  following
the  Closing  will  impact  "EBITDA."  Revenue  generated  through   cross-sells
involving the Company and its  Subsidiaries  and the Buyer and its  Subsidiaries
shall be included in "EBITDA" as mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for the purposes of calculating

to  general  principles  of  equity  (regardless  of  whether  considered  in  a
proceeding in equity or an action at law).

         1.3.19. "Environmental Laws" shall mean any Legal Requirement in effect
on or prior to the Closing Date relating to (i) releases or threatened  releases
of  Hazardous  Substances,  (ii)  the  manufacture,  handling,  transport,  use,

environment or the protection of human health or the environment.

         1.3.20. "Equity Securities" shall mean, with respect to any Person that

Contractual Obligation for, any right to share in the equity,  income,  revenues

plus (B) fifty five percent (55%) of the positive  difference,  if any, of Fifty

Million  Eight   Hundred   Forty  Three   Thousand  Two  Hundred  Fifty  Dollars

Million Dollars ($55,000,000) less the Indebtedness and Expenses Amount ((A) and
(B)  collectively,  the  "Closing  Stock  Dollar  Amount").  For the  purpose of
determining  the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
this Section 2.3.4,  the Buyer Common Stock shall be valued at $36.276 per share
(the "Execution Date Share Price"),  which  represents the average closing price
of Buyer's  Common Stock on the New York Stock  Exchange for the period April 8,
2002 through May 3, 2002. The shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued pursuant
to this Section 2.3.4 shall be allocated among, and delivered to, the Sellers at
the Closing as set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto.

                  (b)    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  (i)  if  the  Closing

per share, then the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued pursuant
to  subparagraph  (a) of this Section  2.3.4 shall be the  quotient  obtained by
dividing the product of the Closing Stock Dollar Amount and .89 ($32.276 divided
by $36.276)  by the  Closing  Share  Price,  (ii) if the Closing  Share Price is
greater than $40.276 per share but less than $47.276 per share,  then the number
of shares of Buyer Common  Stock to be issued  pursuant to  subparagraph  (a) of
this Section 2.3.4 shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the product of the
Closing Stock Dollar Amount and 1.11 ($40.276 divided by $36.276) by the Closing
Share Price ("Adjusted Issued Price" shall equal the Closing Stock Dollar Amount
divided by the number of shares  actually  issued  under this  Section  2.3.4 as
adjusted by Section 2.3.4(b) , and (iii) if the Closing Share Price is less than
$25.276 per share or greater  than  $47.276 per share,  then Buyer and  Sellers'
Representative each shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 12.1(b)  without any liability of any party to any other party,  subject
to the terms of Section 12.2 below.

                  (c)     The  number  of shares  of Buyer   Common  Stock to be
issued pursuant to this Section 2.3.4 shall be adjusted appropriately if, during
the period  commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Closing Date,  Buyer
(i) effects any  dividend  payable in shares of Buyer  Common Stock or any other
class of Equity  Securities;  (ii) splits or combines the outstanding  shares of
Buyer Common Stock;  (iii) effects any  reorganization  or  reclassification  of
Buyer  Common  Stock or any other  class of Equity  Securities;  or (iv) fixes a
record  date  for  the  determination  of  shareholders  entitled  to any of the
foregoing.  No fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock will be issued under this
Section  2.3.4  and any  fractional  shares  will be  rounded  up or down to the
nearest  whole  number of shares to avoid the issuance of  fractional  shares (a
fractional  share  of 0.5 or more  will be  rounded  up;  less  than 0.5 will be
rounded  down).  The  issuance  of  shares  of Buyer  Common  Stock to be issued
pursuant  to this  Section  2.3.4  hereof  shall be duly  registered  under  the
Securities Act, and subject to Rule 145  restrictions  as promulgated  under the
Securities Act.

Sellers  become the  record  holder of the  shares of Buyer  Common  Stock to be
delivered to Sellers  pursuant to Section 2.3.4:  (i) Buyer's board of directors

Common  Stock (it being  agreed  that  Buyer's  quarterly  cash  dividend to its
shareholders  shall not be deemed an extraordinary  dividend) or (ii) Buyer pays
an extraordinary  dividend on its Common Stock, then in either event Buyer shall
deliver to the Sellers (by wire transfer to the Sellers' Account) at the Closing

                                       15
<PAGE>

extraordinary  dividend is actually paid to  shareholders),  by wire transfer or
other   immediately   available   funds,  an  aggregate   amount  equal  to  the
extraordinary  dividends,  if any, that would have been payable on the number of
shares  actually  delivered  to, and received by, the Sellers under this Section
2.3.4, as if such shares of Buyer Common Stock had been issued to the Sellers on

Rate per annum from the date any such  extraordinary  dividend  had been paid to
other  shareholders of the Buyer, to be allocated among the Sellers as set forth

Subsidiaries  (as calculated  pursuant to Section 2.4) is less than Twenty Seven
Million Dollars  ($27,000,000) then the Year One Nominal Amount shall be reduced
by the product of 5.0  multiplied  by the amount by which the Year One EBITDA is
less than Twenty  Seven  Million  Dollars  ($27,000,000),  but in no event below
zero.  If on or after the Closing  Date and before the date  Sellers  become the

such a dividend on its Common Stock, then in either event Buyer shall deliver to
the Sellers (by wire  transfer to the  Sellers'  Account) at the time shares are
delivered  hereunder  (or at such later date as a dividend is  actually  paid to
shareholders),  by wire  transfer  or  other  immediately  available  funds,  an
aggregate amount equal to the dividends, if any, that would have been payable on
the number of shares  actually  delivered to, and received by, the Sellers under

Price;  provided,  however,  if the  Year  Two  EBITDA  of the  Company  and its
Subsidiaries (as calculated pursuant to Section 2.4) is less than Thirty Million
Dollars  ($30,000,000),  the Year Two  Nominal  Amount  shall be  reduced by the
product  of 3.75  multiplied  by the amount by which the Year Two EBITDA is less
than Thirty Million  Dollars  ($30,000,000),  but not below zero. If on or after
the Closing  Date and before the date  Sellers  become the record  holder of the
shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued and  delivered to Sellers  pursuant to
this Section 2.3.5(b): (i) Buyer's board of directors declares a record date for

shareholders),  by wire  transfer  or  other  immediately  available  funds,  an
aggregate amount equal to the dividends, if any, that would have been payable on
the number of shares  actually  delivered to, and received by, the Sellers under

to the Sellers on the Closing Date, together with interest on such amount at the
Government  Fund  Rate  from the date any such  dividend  had been paid to other

the maximum  number of shares of Buyer  Common Stock that could have been issued
pursuant to this  Section  2.3.5(b),  together  with all related  dividends  and
interest  calculated as provided in this Section  2.3.5(b),  shall be issued and
delivered to the Sellers on the  forty-fifth  (45th) calendar day following Year
One.

                  (c)     The shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued pursuant
to this  Section  2.3.5 shall be adjusted  appropriately  if,  during the period
commencing  on the date hereof and ending on the date such  shares are  actually
delivered to Sellers,  Buyer (i) effects any dividend payable in shares of Buyer
Common  Stock or any other class of Equity  Securities;  (ii) splits or combines
the outstanding  shares of Buyer Common Stock;  (iii) effects any reorganization
or  reclassification  of  Buyer  Common  Stock  or any  other  class  of  Equity
Securities;  or (iv) fixes a record date for the  determination  of shareholders
entitled to any of the  foregoing.  No  fractional  shares of Buyer Common Stock
will be issued  under  this  Section  2.3.5 and any  fractional  shares  will be
rounded up or down to the nearest  whole  number of shares to avoid the issuance
of fractional shares (a fractional share of 0.5 or more will be rounded up; less
than 0.5 will be rounded down).  The issuance of shares of Buyer Common Stock to
be issued  pursuant to Section 2.3.5 hereof shall be duly  registered  under the
Securities Act, and subject to Rule 145  restrictions  as promulgated  under the
Securities Act.

                  (d)     In the event that, prior to the payment  of any amount
payable  under this Section  2.3.5,  Buyer has  delivered  notice of a claim for
indemnification  in accordance  with Article X hereof that is not resolved as of
the date payment is due under this  Section  2.3.5,  then Buyer,  subject to the
limitations  contained  in  Article  X,  shall have the right to retain all or a
sufficient amount of such payment to satisfy the amount or amounts claimed. Upon
a final determination of such claim, Buyer shall promptly deliver to Sellers the
amount due under this Section 2.3.5 less any amounts applied as  indemnification
for such claim in accordance with Article X hereof.

                  (e)     The  determination  of Year  One  EBITDA  and Year Two
EBITDA for the  purposes  of making the  determinations  under this  Section 2.3
shall be made as provided in Section 2.4.1.

         Section 2.4.  Possible Earnout Payments Following the Closing.

         2.4.1.  Calculation of EBITDA. Sellers' Representative shall cause (and
Buyer  shall not  prohibit  or  prevent)  the  Company's  and its  Subsidiaries'
combined EBITDA to be determined and an EBITDA  statement to be delivered to the
Buyer, with appropriate workpapers and backup


                                       17
<PAGE>

for the calculations  made therein,  on or before the fifteenth (15th) day after
the last day of Year One and Year Two,  as the case may be (the  "Annual  Income
Statement").

         If within  thirty  (30) days  following  receipt of the  Annual  Income
Statement,  Buyer  has not  given  Sellers'  Representative  written  notice  of
objection to such Annual Income  Statement (such notice must contain a statement
in reasonable  detail of the basis of such  objections),  then the Company's and
its Subsidiaries'  combined EBITDA reflected in the Annual Income Statement will
be used in computing  any payments due under this Section 2.4 or Section  2.3.5.
If Buyer  gives such  notice of  objection,  and the items in dispute  cannot be
resolved by  agreement  between the  Sellers'  Representative  and Buyer  within
thirty  (30) days  following  Sellers'  Representative's  receipt of the Buyer's
written  objection,  the issues in dispute will be submitted to the  Alternative
Accountants for resolution,  with instructions to the Alternative Accountants to
determine the Company's and its Subsidiaries' combined EBITDA in accordance with
the definitions and principles set forth in this Agreement. If issues in dispute
are submitted to the Alternative  Accountants for resolution,  (a) each of Buyer
and the Sellers' Representative will furnish to the Alternative Accountants such
work papers and other documents and information  relating to the disputed issues
as the  Alternative  Accountants may request and are available to it and will be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Alternative  Accountants any material
relating  to the  determination  and  to  discuss  the  determination  with  the
Alternative Accountants; (b) the determination by the Alternative Accountants of
EBITDA,  as set forth in a written  notice  delivered  to Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative by the Alternative Accountants, will be binding and conclusive on
the  parties;  and (c)  Buyer  shall  pay all of the  fees and  expenses  of the
Alternative  Accountants in connection with such determination;  provided,  that
Sellers'  Representative  on  behalf  of the  Sellers  shall  pay such  fees and
expenses if the Accountant's  determination of EBITDA is less than 99% of EBITDA
as reflected in the Annual Income Statement.

         2.4.2.  Possible  Year One  Earnout  Payment.  Subject to Buyer's right
of set-off pursuant to Article X hereof,  based on the amount of Year One EBITDA
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall pay to the Sellers as set forth
below:
                 (a) If Year One  EBITDA is less than or equal  to Twenty  Seven
Million Dollars ($27,000,000),  the Sellers shall not be entitled to be paid any
Year One earnout payment.

                 (b) If  Year One EBITDA is greater  than Twenty  Seven  Million
Dollars ($27,000,000),  Buyer shall pay the Sellers an aggregate amount equal to
the product of 7.0  multiplied  by the Year One EBITDA in excess of Twenty Seven
Million  Dollars  ($27,000,000);  provided that, the maximum  aggregate Year One
earnout  payment  payable to the  Sellers  shall be Seventy  Six  Million  Eight
Hundred Seventy Five Thousand  Dollars  ($76,875,000)  (the  "Aggregate  Earnout
Cap").

         2.4.3.  Possible  Year Two  Earnout  Payment.  Subject to Buyer's right
of set-off pursuant to Article X hereof,  based on the amount of Year Two EBITDA
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall pay to the Sellers as set forth
below:

                                       18
<PAGE>

                 (a) If Year Two  EBITDA is less than or equal to Thirty Million
Dollars ($30,000,000), the Sellers shall not be entitled to be paid any Year Two
earnout payment.

                 (b) If Year  Two EBITDA is greater than Thirty Million  Dollars
($30,000,000),  Buyer  shall pay the  Sellers  an  aggregate  amount,  up to the
Aggregate  Earnout Cap,  equal to the product of 5.0  multiplied by the Year Two
EBITDA in excess of Thirty Million  Dollars  ($30,000,000);  provided,  that the
maximum  Year Two  earnout  payment  payable to the  Sellers  shall be Forty Two
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($42,500,000).

         2.4.4.  Aggregate  Year One and Year Two Earnout  Cap.  Notwithstanding
anything  in this  Agreement  to the  contrary,  the maximum  aggregate  earnout
payments to the Sellers under this Section 2.4 with respect to Year One and Year
Two shall not exceed the Aggregate Earnout Cap. To the extent that the Aggregate
Earnout  Cap  is  earned  and  paid  with   respect  to  Year  One,  no  earnout
consideration shall be paid with respect to Year Two under Section 2.4.3 hereof,
regardless of the Year Two EBITDA. In addition,  in the event that, based on the
Year One EBITDA,  Sellers would be due an amount less than the Aggregate Earnout
Cap pursuant to Section  2.4.2 hereof,  Buyer shall have the right,  in its sole
and absolute  discretion,  to pay the Aggregate  Earnout Cap to the Sellers,  in
lieu of the amount  otherwise to be payable pursuant to Section 2.4.2 hereof and
in full  satisfaction  of Buyer's  obligations  under  Sections  2.4.2 and 2.4.3
hereof ("Buyer's Earnout Acceleration Right").

         2.4.5.  Form of Payment; Payment Date.

                 (a) Any   amount   payable   pursuant  to   Section   2.4.2  or
Section  2.4.3 hereof shall be paid,  (A) if Buyer does not object to the Annual
Income Statement pursuant to Section 2.4.1, within forty-five (45) calendar days
following  the last  day of Year  One or Year  Two,  as  applicable,  (B) if the
Sellers'  Representative  has not performed his obligations  under Section 2.4.1
with respect to the timely delivery of the Annual Income  Statement,  then on or
before the thirtieth (30th) calendar day following Buyer's receipt of the Annual
Income Statement,  unless Buyer objects to the Annual Income Statement  pursuant
to  Section  2.4.1,  and (C) if Buyer  objects to the  Annual  Income  Statement
pursuant  to  Section  2.4.1  hereof,  then  three (3)  Business  Days after the
Alternative  Accountants'  determination.  Any amount due under Section 2.4.2 or
2.4.3 shall be paid (i)  thirty-five  percent  (35%) in cash by wire transfer or
other  immediately  available funds to Sellers'  Account,  to be allocated among
Sellers as set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto,  and (ii) sixty-five  percent
(65%) in shares of Buyer Common Stock (such  numbers of shares to be  calculated
as provided below) to be allocated as set forth on Exhibit B. For the purpose of
determining the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be delivered  pursuant
to this  Section  2.4.5,  the Buyer  Common  Stock shall be valued  based on the
average  closing price of Buyer Common Stock on the New York Stock  Exchange for
the twenty (20)  trading day period  ending on the last NYSE trading day of Year
One or Year Two, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Buyer shall
have  the  right,  in its  sole  discretion,  to pay  cash by wire  transfer  of
immediately  available funds in lieu of any or all of the shares of Buyer Common
Stock required to be delivered under Section 2.4 hereof.

                 (b) The  shares  of   Buyer   Common   Stock   to   be   issued
pursuant to this Section  2.4.5 shall be adjusted  appropriately  if, during the
period commencing on the date that is


                                       19
<PAGE>

twenty  trading  days before the end of Year One or Year Two (the date each such
period  commences,  as applicable,  the "Baseline  Date") and ending on the date
such shares are actually issued and delivered to Sellers,  Buyer (i) effects any
dividend  payable in shares of Buyer  Common  Stock or any other class of Equity
Securities;  (ii)  splits or combines  the  outstanding  shares of Buyer  Common
Stock;  (iii) effects any  reorganization  or  reclassification  of Buyer Common
Stock or any other class of Equity  Securities;  or (iv) fixes a record date for
the  determination  of  shareholders  entitled  to  any  of  the  foregoing.  No
fractional  shares of Buyer Common Stock will be issued under this Section 2.4.5
and any fractional shares will be rounded up or down to the nearest whole number
of shares to avoid the issuance of fractional  shares (a fractional share of 0.5
or more will be rounded up; less than 0.5 will be rounded down). The issuance of
shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 2.4.5 hereof shall
be  duly  registered   under  the  Securities  Act,  and  subject  to  Rule  145
restrictions as promulgated under the Securities Act.

                 (c) If  on or  after  the  applicable  Baseline Date and before
the date shares of Buyer  Common  Stock are  actually  issued and  delivered  to
Sellers pursuant to Section 2.4.5(a):  (i) Buyer's board of directors declares a
record date for the payment of a dividend on its Common Stock or (ii) Buyer pays
such a dividend on its Common Stock, then in either event Buyer shall deliver to
the  Sellers (by wire  transfer to Sellers'  Account) at the time such shares of
Buyer Common Stock are issued and delivered (or at such later date as a dividend
is  actually  paid to  shareholders),  by wire  transfer  or  other  immediately
available funds, an aggregate amount equal to the dividends,  if any, that would
have been payable on the number of shares  actually  delivered  to, and received
by, the Sellers  under this  Section  2.4.5,  as if such shares of Buyer  Common
Stock had been issued to the Sellers on the applicable  Baseline Date,  together
with  interest on such amount at a per annum rate equal to the  Government  Fund
Rate  from  the  date any such  extraordinary  dividend  had been  paid to other
shareholders of Buyer, to be allocated among the Sellers as set forth in Exhibit
B.
                 (d) Subject  to  the  terms  of Article X, in the  event  that,
prior to the  payment  of any  amount  payable  under  Section  2.4,  Buyer  has
delivered notice of a claim for  indemnification  hereunder that is not resolved
as of the date payment is due under this Section 2.4,  then Buyer shall have the
right to retain all or a sufficient amount of such payment to satisfy the amount
or amounts  claimed.  Upon a final  determination  of such  claim,  Buyer  shall
promptly  deliver to Sellers  the  amount  due under this  Section  2.4 less any
amounts applied as  indemnification  for such claim in accordance with Article X
hereof.

         Section 2.5.  Adjustments to Consideration.

         2.5.1.  Company Tangible Net Worth Adjustment.  After the Closing,  the
purchase  consideration  shall be decreased dollar for dollar by the amount,  if
any, by which the Tangible Net Worth of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole,  as of the  Closing  Date but before  giving  effect to the  transactions
contemplated  by this  Agreement,  is less than zero (in such case, the "Company
Net  Adjustment to Buyer"),  and increased  dollar for dollar by the amount,  if
any, by which the Tangible Net Worth of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole,  as of the  Closing  Date but before  giving  effect to the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, is greater than zero (in such case, the "Company
Net Adjustment to Selling Members").  Such


                                       20
<PAGE>

adjustment  shall be  determined on the basis of a Closing Date balance sheet of
Company and its Subsidiaries  prepared by or on behalf of the Selling Members by
the Sellers'  Representative  in accordance  with  Company's  GAAP (the "Company
Closing Date Balance Sheet").  Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary,
the Company  Closing Date Balance  Sheet shall include an accrual for a customer
cancellation  reserve equal to .22% of the Company's  consolidated total revenue
for the twelve  months  preceding  the Closing  Date.  The Company  Closing Date
Balance Sheet shall be delivered to Buyer within  forty-five (45) days following
Closing.  Buyer and its representatives,  at Buyer's expense, shall be permitted
to review and, in Buyer's  discretion,  audit,  the Company Closing Date Balance
Sheet and the work papers related to the  preparation  and review of the Company
Closing Date Balance  Sheet for a period of 30 days  following  Buyer's  receipt
thereof,  and, in the event of any dispute  concerning  the  correctness of such
Company Closing Date Balance Sheet,  Buyer shall notify Sellers'  Representative
of such dispute and if not resolved within 35 days following  Buyer's receipt of
the Company  Closing Date Balance Sheet,  such dispute shall be submitted to the
Alternative  Accountants  for resolution,  with  instructions to the Alternative
Accountants to determine the Company's and its Subsidiaries'  Tangible Net Worth
in accordance  with the  definitions and principles set forth in this Agreement.
If issues in dispute are submitted to such accounting  firm for resolution,  (i)
Buyer and Sellers' Representative will furnish to such accounting firm such work
papers and other  documents and  information  relating to the disputed issues as
such  accounting  firm may  request  and are  available  to Buyer  and  Sellers'
Representative,  and  will  be  afforded  an  opportunity  to  present  to  such
accounting firm any material  relating to the  determination  and to discuss the
determination with such accounting firm, (ii) a determination by such accounting
firm of Tangible Net Worth,  as set forth in a notice  delivered to both parties
by such  accounting  firm,  will be binding and  conclusive on the parties,  and
(iii)  Buyer  shall  pay  all of  the  fees  and  expenses  of  the  Alternative
Accountants  in  connection  with such  determination;  provided,  that Sellers'
Representative  on behalf of the Sellers shall pay such fees and expenses if the
Accountant's  determination  of Tangible  Net Worth is less than 98% of Tangible
Net Worth as  reflected  in the Closing  Date  Balance  Sheet.  Buyer or Selling
Members, severally but not jointly, whichever is the case, shall pay the Company
Net  Adjustment  to Selling  Members or the  Company  Net  Adjustment  to Buyer,
whichever is the case, to Sellers' Account or Buyer, as the case may be, by wire
transfer or delivery  of other  immediately  available  funds  within  three (3)
Business Days after the date on which  Tangible Net Worth is finally  determined
by  the  Alternative   Accountants,   or  if  Buyer  does  not  notify  Sellers'
Representative  of a  dispute,  as  provided  above,  then  within 35 days after
Buyer's  receipt of the Company  Closing  Date  Balance  Sheet.  Any Company Net
Adjustment to Selling Members payable to, or any Company Net Adjustment to Buyer
payable by, Selling Members,  as the case may be, shall be paid or received,  as
the case may be, as set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto.

         2.5.2.  HIRAC  Tangible Net Worth  Adjustment.  After the Closing,  the
purchase  consideration  shall be decreased dollar for dollar by the amount,  if
any, by which the  Tangible Net Worth of HIRAC as of the Closing Date but before
giving effect to the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  is less than
zero (in such case, the "HIRAC Net Adjustment to Buyer"),  and increased  dollar
for dollar by the amount, if any, by which the Tangible Net Worth of HIRAC as of
the Closing Date but before giving effect to the  transactions  contemplated  by
this Agreement, is greater than zero (in such case, the "HIRAC Net Adjustment to
Selling  Shareholders").  Such adjustment  shall be determined on the basis of a
Closing  Date  balance


                                       21
<PAGE>

sheet of HIRAC prepared by or on behalf of the Selling  Shareholders by Sellers'
Representative  in  accordance  with  Company's  GAAP (the "HIRAC  Closing  Date
Balance Sheet").  The HIRAC Closing Date Balance Sheet shall not reflect HIRAC's
ownership of membership interests in the Company as an asset of HIRAC. The HIRAC
Closing Date Balance  Sheet shall be delivered to Buyer within  forty-five  (45)
days following Closing. Buyer and its representatives, at Buyer's expense, shall
be permitted to review, and in Buyer's discretion, audit, the HIRAC Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the work papers related to the  preparation  and review of the
HIRAC  Closing  Date  Balance  Sheet for a period of 30 days  following  Buyer's
receipt thereof,  and, in the event of any dispute concerning the correctness of
such  HIRAC   Closing  Date   Balance   Sheet,   Buyer  shall  notify   Sellers'
Representative  of such  dispute and if not  resolved  within 35 days  following
Buyer's  receipt of the HIRAC Closing Date Balance Sheet,  such dispute shall be
submitted to the Alternative  Accountants for resolution,  with  instructions to
the  Alternative  Accountants  to  determine  the Tangible Net Worth of HIRAC in
accordance with the  definitions and principles set forth in this Agreement.  If
issues in dispute are  submitted to such  accounting  firm for  resolution,  (i)
Buyer and Sellers' Representative will furnish to such accounting firm such work
papers and other  documents and  information  relating to the disputed issues as
such  accounting  firm may  request  and are  available  to Buyer  and  Sellers'
Representative,  and  will  be  afforded  an  opportunity  to  present  to  such
accounting firm any material  relating to the  determination  and to discuss the
determination with such accounting firm, (ii) a determination by such accounting
firm of the Tangible Net Worth of HIRAC,  as set forth in a notice  delivered to
both parties by such  accounting  firm,  will be binding and  conclusive  on the
parties,  and  (iii)  Buyer  shall  pay  all of the  fees  and  expenses  of the
Alternative  Accountants in connection with such determination;  provided,  that
Sellers'  Representative  on  behalf  of the  Sellers  shall  pay such  fees and
expenses if the  Accountant's  determination  of Tangible Net Worth is less than
98% of Tangible Net Worth as reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheet.  Buyer
or Selling Shareholders, severally not jointly, whichever is the case, shall pay
the HIRAC Net Adjustment to Selling  Shareholders or the HIRAC Net Adjustment to
Buyer,  whichever is the case, to Selling Shareholders or Buyer, as the case may
be, by wire  transfer or delivery of other  immediately  available  funds within
three (3) Business Days after the date on which the HIRAC  Tangible Net Worth is
finally determined by the Alternative  Accountants,  or if Buyer does not notify
Sellers'  Representative  of a dispute  as  provided  above,  then 35 days after
Buyer's  receipt  of the  HIRAC  Closing  Date  Balance  Sheet.  Any  HIRAC  Net
Adjustment to Selling  Shareholders  payable to, or any HIRAC Net  Adjustment to
Buyer payable by, Selling Shareholders,  as the case may be, shall be payable in
accordance with the allocations as set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto.

         Section 2.6. Time and Place of Closing. The closing of the purchase and
sale  of the  Company  Shares,  the  HIRAC  Shares  and the  other  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the  "Closing")  shall take place at the offices
of Buyer,  4951 Lake Brook Drive,  Glen Allen,  Virginia  23060 at 10:00 a.m. on
July 1, 2002, or as soon  thereafter as all conditions set forth in Articles VII
and VIII have been  satisfied or waived or at such other time and place as Buyer
and the Sellers'  Representative  may mutually agree;  provided that the Closing
Date  shall in no event be later  than July 31,  2002,  except in the event of a
second request for  information  under the HSR Act, in which case such date will
be extended thirty days from the date of the parties'  response to such request.
The time and date of the  Closing  is herein  called  the  "Closing  Date."  The
purchase of the Company  Shares and the HIRAC Shares and the other  transactions
contemplated hereby shall be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date.

         Section 2.7. Delivery.  At the Closing,  Sellers will convey,  transfer
and assign the  Company  Shares and the HIRAC  Shares to Buyer free and clear of
any Liens, and will deliver to Buyer certificates  evidencing all of the Company
Shares and the HIRAC  Shares duly  endorsed  or  accompanied  by separate  stock
power(s) duly  endorsed,  with all required  transfer Tax stamps  affixed and in

such  jurisdiction  recognizes  such concept),  in each  jurisdiction  where the
nature of the  Company's or such  Subsidiary's  activities  or its  ownership or
leasing of property requires such qualification or license; except to the extent
that the  failure  to be so  qualified  or  licensed  would not have a  Material
Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

         3.1.2.  Authorization  and  Enforceability.  As of the  Execution Date,
this Agreement has been duly  authorized,  executed and delivered by the Company

Date will be, duly authorized, duly executed and delivered by the Company or the
applicable Sellers and will be Enforceable  against Company or such Sellers,  as
the case may be.

Disclosure  Letter,  neither the  execution,  delivery and  performance  of this
Agreement nor the  consummation of any of the transactions  contemplated  hereby
(including,  without limitation, the execution,  delivery and performance of the
Closing  Agreements)  does or will  constitute,  result in or give rise to (i) a
breach or violation or default under any material Legal  Requirement  applicable
to the  Company  or  any  of its  Subsidiaries  (assuming  the  accuracy  of the
representations  and  warranties of Buyer),  (ii) a breach of or a default under
any Charter or Bylaws provision of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii)

Subsidiaries,  and  Insurance  Policies,  but  excluding  the Company  Plans and
Company  Benefit  Arrangements,  being  referred to herein  collectively  as the
"Contracts").  To the Company's knowledge, each material Contract is Enforceable
by the Company or any Subsidiary of Company which is party thereto, against each
Person  (other than Company or any  Subsidiary  of Company)  party  thereto.  No
material  breach or default by Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  under any of
the material  Contracts  has occurred and is  continuing,  and to the  Company's
knowledge,  no event has  occurred or  circumstance  exists which with notice or
lapse of time would  constitute such a breach or default or permit  termination,
modification  or  acceleration  by any other  Person  under any of the  material
Contracts or would result in a loss of rights or creation of any Lien thereunder
or  pursuant  thereto  except  as  would  arise  from  execution,  delivery  and
performance  of this Agreement and the Closing  Agreements.  To the knowledge of
the Company,  no material breach or default by any other Person under any of the
material Contracts has occurred and is continuing,  and no event has occurred or
circumstance  exists that with notice or lapse of time would  constitute  such a
breach or default or permit termination, modification or acceleration by Company

Policies or renewals  thereof have been paid or will be paid timely  through the

Insurance  Policies nor any default by any other party to the Insurance Policies

occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach
or  default  or permit  termination,  modification  or  acceleration,  under any

insurer denying  coverage or reserving rights with respect to a particular claim

commissions or other revenues received from each such client 2001. Since January

the case  may be,  has an  appointment  to act as an  agent  for each  insurance
company from which it needs such an appointment to conduct its business,  except
where the  failure to have such  appointment  would not have a material  adverse
effect on the Company or its  Subsidiaries,  each such  appointment is valid and
binding in accordance with its terms on the parties thereto,  and there has been
no indication  that any such  appointment  will be, nor do any grounds exist, to
the best  knowledge  of the  Company,  which may result in any such  appointment
being,  revoked,  rescinded  or  terminated.  Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries  is a party to any written  agreement  which prevents it from doing
business with any insurance company,  agent, or broker.  Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has bound, or committed to bind, any insurance  coverage
for any liability,  risk, cost, or expense, or in any amount of liability, risk,
cost or  expense,  or upon


                                       41

Disclosure  Letter  sets forth a true and  complete  list of (a) each  insurance

applicable   period;  and  (b)  each  insurance  company  that  paid  contingent

each such insurance company and the amount of the contingent commissions paid to
the Company.  To the Company's  knowledge,  no insurance  companies,  agents, or

accounts of the Company and its Subsidiaries  represent genuine insurance placed
through the Company and its  Subsidiaries for the commissions and fees set forth

<PAGE>

HIRAC is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign  corporation and
is in good  standing as such (to the extent such  jurisdiction  recognizes  such
concept),  in each jurisdiction where the nature of its activities requires such
qualification or license.

         4.1.2.  Authorization and Enforceability. Upon execution by the Selling
Shareholders,  this  Agreement  will  have been duly  authorized,  executed  and
delivered  by the  Selling  Shareholders  and will be  Enforceable  against  the
Selling  Shareholders.  Each of the  Closing  Agreements  to which  any  Selling
Shareholder  is a party as reflected on the signature page thereof has been duly
authorized,  and,  on or before the  Closing  Date,  will be duly  executed  and
delivered  by such  Selling  Shareholder  and will be  Enforceable  against such
Selling Shareholder, as the case may be.

         4.1.3.  Non-Contravention.  No approval, consent, waiver, authorization
or other  order  of,  and no  filing,  notice,  registration,  qualification  or
recording with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required to be

their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in connection with the execution,  delivery or
performance  of  this  Agreement  and  the   consummation  of  the  transactions

Disclosure  Letter,  each of which shall have been obtained or made and shall be
in full force and effect at the Closing. Except as set forth in Section 4.1.3 of
the HIRAC Disclosure Letter, neither the execution,  delivery and performance of
this  Agreement nor the  consummation  of any of the  transactions  contemplated
hereby (including,  without limitation, the execution,  delivery and performance
of the Closing  Agreements) does or will  constitute,  result in or give rise to
(i) a breach or  violation  or  default  under any  material  Legal  Requirement
applicable to HIRAC (assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
of Buyer),  (ii) a breach of or a default under any Charter or Bylaws  provision
of HIRAC or the Selling  Shareholders,  (iii) the  acceleration  of the time for

the  Subsidiaries  of Buyer have been duly granted and continue to hold,  and at

renew in the ordinary course any material Buyer Permits.

         Section 5.5. Litigation.  Except as  set forth  in  Section  5.5 of the
Buyer Disclosure  Letter,  there is no Action against Buyer or any Subsidiary of
Buyer, pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened,  which Buyer or any of

Action pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened,  that seeks rescission
of, seeks to enjoin the consummation of, or otherwise relates to, this Agreement
or  any  of  the  transactions   contemplated   hereby.  No  Governmental  Order
specifically  directed at Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries has been issued which
has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.6. Financing. Buyer has received and delivered to the Company

Wachovia Bank, National Association ("Lead Lender") dated as of May 3, 2002 (the
"Commitment  Letter"),  which is in an amount  sufficient to enable Buyer to pay
the cash consideration payable by Buyer at the Closing. The terms of such letter
have not been  altered  or  amended  by Buyer or Lead  Lender,  and such  letter
remains  in full  force and  effect  (unless  superseded  by  definitive  credit
documentation that would not have a material adverse effect upon Buyer's ability
to perform its  obligations  under this  Agreement).  As of the Execution  Date,
Buyer has no knowledge  that the conditions of the funding  contemplated  by the
Commitment  Letter will not be satisfied,  and Buyer believes in good faith that
the conditions to funding will be satisfied.

schedules,  forms,  statements  and  other  documents  with the  Securities  and

dates,  contained any untrue statements of a material fact or omitted to state a
material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make the
statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which they were made,
not misleading.

         Section 6.7. Company Tax Matters.

         6.7.1.  Tax Indemnification.

                 (i)     Sellers, severally but not jointly, shall be liable for
and shall pay (and shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from and against) (x)
all Taxes with respect to the Company and its  Subsidiaries  for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period but only to the extent the amount payable  exceeds the amount accrued
therefor in the Company  Closing Date Balance Sheet (a "Company Tax Loss"),  and
(y) for any  breaches of the  representations  and  warranties  found in Section
3.13(f),  (h) and (i). The indemnity  contained in this Section 6.7 shall be the
sole and  exclusive  remedy for all  breaches  of Section  3.13 or any other Tax
matters relating to the Company and its  Subsidiaries,  and shall not be subject
to the  Deductible  Amount.  For  purposes  of this  Section  6.7,  (A) the term
"Pre-Closing  Tax Period" shall mean all taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and the portion  ending on the Closing  Date of any taxable  period
that  includes  (but  does  not end  on)  the  Closing  Date,  and (B) the  term
"Post-Closing  Tax Period" shall mean all taxable periods that begin on or after
the day following the Closing Date and the portion  beginning  after the Closing
Date of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date.
Buyer shall be liable (and shall  indemnify  and hold the Sellers  harmless from
and  against)  any  Taxes  with  respect  to  the  Company  attributable  to any
Post-Closing   Tax  Period.   The  parties   agree  that  the  Company  and  its
Subsidiaries,  other than those Subsidiaries classified as U.S. corporations for
federal income tax purposes ("non-corporate Subsidiaries"),  shall


                                       52
<PAGE>

terminate for Income Tax purposes  pursuant to Section  708(b)(1)(B) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder at the time of the Closing. For purposes
of the foregoing,  the  Pre-Closing  Tax Period shall include the taxable period
which  ends  upon  the   termination  of  the  Company  and  its   non-corporate
Subsidiaries and the Post-Closing Tax Period shall begin upon the termination of
the Company and its non-corporate Subsidiaries.

                 (ii)     For purposes  of  this  Section  6.7.1, in the case of
any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic  basis and are payable for a Tax period
that includes  (but does not end on) the Closing  Date,  the portion of such Tax
related to the portion of such Tax period  ending on the Closing  Date shall (x)
in the case of any Taxes  other  than  Taxes  based  upon or  related to income,
sales, gross receipts,  wages, capital expenditures or expenses, be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period  multiplied by a fraction,  the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing
Date and the  denominator  of  which is the  number  of days in the  entire  Tax
period,  and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income,  sales,
gross receipts,  wages, capital expenditures or expenses, be deemed equal to the
amount  which would be payable if the  relevant  Tax period ended on the Closing
Date.  Any  overpayment  of  Tax by  the  Company  or  any  Subsidiary  for  the
Pre-Closing Tax Period, as determined under this Section 6.7.1.,  shall be taken
into  account  in the  calculation  of  Tangible  Net Worth of  Company  and its
Subsidiaries.  In this regard, with respect to the compensation  expense related
to the repurchase of any options issued by Hobbs/OFJ  Acquisition Corp. ("OFJ"),
options, OFJ will be entitled to claim such deductions prior to the Closing date
and such deduction will be included in the  calculation of Tangible Net Worth of
the Company and its  Subsidiaries  pursuant to Section  2.5.1.  No  Subsidiaries
shall make an election to forego a carry back of a loss under Section  172(b)(3)
of the Code for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

                 (iii)    Except as reserved for  in  the Closing  Date  Balance
Sheet, any payment pursuant to this Section 6.7.1 shall be made (x) if reflected
on a Tax Return, contemporaneously with the filing of such Tax Return and (y) in
all other  cases,  not later than  thirty  (30) days after  receipt by  Sellers'
Representative  of written  notice from Buyer  stating that any Company Tax Loss
has been paid by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or,  effective upon the Closing,
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company,  and the amount thereof and of the
indemnity payment requested;  provided,  however, no payment shall be made until
the procedures set forth in Section 6.7.3 have been complied with.

                 (iv)     If any claim or demand for Taxes in  respect  of which
indemnity  may be sought  pursuant to this Section  6.7.1 is asserted in writing
against Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, the Company
or any  Subsidiary  of the  Company,  Buyer shall  promptly  notify the Sellers'
Representative  of such claim or demand within  sufficient time that would allow
the Sellers' Representative to timely respond to such claim or demand, and shall
give the Sellers' Representative such information with respect thereto as he may
reasonably  request.  Sellers'  Representative,  on behalf of the  Sellers,  may
discharge, at any time, Sellers' indemnification  obligations under this Section
6.7.2 by  paying  to Buyer  the  amount  of the  applicable  Company  Tax  Loss,
calculated  on the date of such  payment.  The Sellers'  Representative  may, at
Sellers'  expense,  participate in and, upon notice to Buyer,  assume and direct
the  defense of any such  Action  (including  any Tax  audit).  If the  Sellers'
Representative  assume such  defense  and if the  relevant  Action  relates to a
taxable period that includes (but does


                                       53
<PAGE>

not end on) the Closing  Date,  Buyer shall have the right (but not the duty) to
participate  in the defense  thereof to the extent it relates to Taxes for which
Buyer is not entitled to indemnification hereunder and to employ counsel, at its
own expense,  separate from the counsel employed by the Sellers' Representative.
Whether or not the Sellers'  Representative  chooses to defend or prosecute  any
Action,  all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof.

                 (v)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims  related to this
Section 6.7 hereof shall not have a time  limitation with respect to such claims
or any suit instituted with respect thereto,  except for any applicable  statute
of limitations.

         6.7.2.  Transfer Taxes. All transfer,  documentary,  sales, use, stamp,
registration  and  other  such  Taxes  and fees  (including  any  penalties  and
interest)  incurred in connection  with this Agreement shall be borne equally by
Sellers and Buyer. No such Taxes or fees shall be included in the calculation of
EBITDA for any purposes hereunder.

         6.7.3.  Return Filings, Refunds and Credits.

                 (i)      Sellers and Buyer  agree  that  the  Company  and  its
noncorporate  Subsidiaries will terminate for Income Tax purposes on the Closing
Date pursuant to Section  708(b)(1)(B) of the Code and the Treasury  Regulations
thereunder.  Sellers'  Representative  shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed,  all Tax Returns  (including  amended Tax Returns) of
the Company  and its  Subsidiaries  for all Tax periods  ending on or before the
Closing Date including the Company and  Subsidiaries'  final Tax Returns for the
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (collectively,  the "Company
Final Tax Returns"),  and shall be responsible for remitting all Taxes reflected
on such Tax  Returns,  net of any  reserves  provided  for in the  Closing  Date
Balance  Sheet.  To the extent  amounts are due on such Tax Returns and reserved
for in the Closing  Date Balance  Sheet,  the Buyer will advance to the Sellers'
Account the amount owed.  Sellers  shall pay the cost of preparing  all such Tax
Returns.  Copies of all such Tax Returns  (for or  including a  Pre-Closing  Tax
Period) shall be furnished to the Buyer.

                 (ii)     Buyer shall prepare or  cause to be prepared  and file
or cause to be filed on a timely  basis  all Tax  Returns  with  respect  to the
Company and its Subsidiaries  for taxable periods  including (but not ending on)
the Closing Date (taking into account  extensions)  and shall be responsible for
remitting  all Taxes  reflected  on such Tax  Returns.  If requested by Sellers'
Representative,  Buyer  shall  furnish  copies of all such Tax  Returns  for the
reasonable review and reasonable approval of Sellers' Representative.

                 (iii)    Sellers  and  Buyer  shall reasonably  cooperate,  and
shall cause their  respective  Affiliates,  agents,  auditors,  representatives,
officers and employees reasonably to cooperate,  in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns (including amended returns and claims for refund), including maintaining
and making available to each other all records reasonably required in connection
with Taxes and in resolving  all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable
periods  relating  to Taxes.  Buyer and  Sellers  agree to retain or cause to be
retained  all books and records  pertinent  to the Company and its  Subsidiaries
until the applicable  period for assessment  under applicable law (giving effect
to any and all extensions or waivers) has expired,  and to


                                       54
<PAGE>

abide by or cause the abidance with all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority.  Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate with each other in
the  conduct  of any audit or other  proceedings  involving  the  Company or any
Subsidiary  of the  Company  for any Tax  purposes  and each shall  execute  and
deliver  such powers of attorney and other  documents as are  necessary to carry
out the  intent  of  this  subsection.  Any  Tax  Return  prepared  by  Sellers'
Representative  pursuant  to Section  6.7.3.(i)  shall be  prepared  in a manner
consistent  with past  practice  and  without a change  of any  election  or any
accounting  method  and  shall be  submitted  to the  Buyer,  if  requested,  in
sufficient  time to permit a reasonable  review prior to the due date (including
extensions)  of such Tax Return.  Buyer will not  prepare any Tax Return,  which
includes  a  Pre-Closing  Tax  Period,  in a manner  inconsistent  with the past
practices of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  which would adversely affect the
Sellers.  Buyer or Sellers'  Representative,  as the case may be, shall have the
right to review all work papers and  procedures  used to prepare any Tax Return.
If Buyer or Sellers'  Representative,  within  twenty (20)  Business  Days after
delivery of any such Tax  Return,  notifies  the other party in writing  that it
objects to any items in such Tax Return, the parties shall proceed in good faith
to resolve the  disputed  items and, if they are unable to do so within ten (10)
Business Days, the disputed items shall be resolved  (within a reasonable  time,
taking into account the deadline for filing such Tax Return) with respect to (i)
items for which Sellers or Buyer is solely liable,  by reference to such party's
treatment  and  (ii) all  other  items,  by the  Alternative  Accountants.  Upon
resolution of all disputed  items,  the relevant Tax Return shall be adjusted to
reflect such  resolution and shall be binding upon the parties  without  further
adjustment. The costs, fees and expense of such Alternative Accountants shall be
borne equally by the Sellers and Buyer.

                 (iv)     With  respect  to  Tax   refunds   pertaining  to  the
Company or its  Subsidiaries  for any tax period or portion thereof ending on or
before the  Closing  Date:  (a) if and to the extent such refund is less than or
equal to the  corresponding  asset reflected on the Company Closing Date Balance
Sheet,  Buyer shall be entitled to retain the entire  amount;  and (b) if and to
the extent such  refund  exceeds the asset so  reflected,  the Sellers  shall be
entitled to such excess amount.

                 (v)      If  and to the extent any Liability  reflected on the
Company  Closing  Date Balance  Sheet for Taxes proves to have been  overstated,
Buyer shall pay to the  Sellers'  Account for the benefit of the Sellers cash in
the aggregate amount of such overstatement.

         6.7.4   Allocation of  Consideration.  The Buyer and the Sellers  shall
cooperate as provided herein in determining the allocation of the  consideration
paid by Buyer for the  Company  Shares  among the assets of the  Company.  Buyer
shall  initially  determine  such  allocation  and  shall  notify  the  Sellers'
Representative in writing of the allocation so determined within sixty (60) days
after  the  Closing  Date.  Sellers  shall  be  deemed  to  have  accepted  such
determination  unless Sellers'  Representative  notifies Buyer in writing of the
Sellers'  Representative's  proposed  allocation  within  sixty  (60) days after
receipt of Buyer's proposed allocation.  If the Sellers' Representative provides
such  notice to Buyer,  the  parties  shall  proceed in good faith to  determine
mutually  the matters in dispute.  If they are unable to do so within sixty (60)
days,  the matter shall be referred to an appraisal  firm chosen by and mutually
acceptable  to both Buyer and Sellers'  Representative  (the  "Appraiser").  The
decision of the Appraiser shall be binding on both parties. The Appraiser's fees
shall be shared equally by


                                       55
<PAGE>

Buyer and the Sellers. Neither Buyer nor the Sellers shall take any position for
tax purposes that is inconsistent with the final allocation determined hereunder
unless such position would be inconsistent with a final  non-appealable  (except
to the United  States  Supreme  Court)  judgment  which has been rendered in any
judicial processing governing such position.

         6.7.5.  Section  754  Election.  On or at any  time  after  the Closing
Date,  Buyer may,  in its sole  discretion  and with no  consent of the  parties
hereto required, make an election under Code Section 754 for the Company.

         6.7.6.  Installment  Sale Reporting.  The Selling Members and the Buyer
agree for Tax purposes to treat the sale and  purchase of the Company  Shares as
an  installment  sale  under  Section  453 of the Code and  amounts  paid  under
Sections  2.3.5 and 2.4 as contingent  payments  subject to the  application  of
Section 483 of the Code.

         6.7.7.  Certain  Costs.  The  following  expenses  associated  with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deducted or otherwise taken
into account in the preparation of the Company Final Tax Returns: those expenses
described in Sections  2.3.1,  2.3.2,  6.7.1.(ii) and the  compensation  expense
related to the  transfer by Brent  Finnegan to Peter  Marcia of a portion of the
consideration  received or  receivable  by Mr.  Finnegan  under this  Agreement.
Further,  for  Income Tax  purposes,  to the extent  appropriate  as  reasonably
determined  by the Sellers'  Representative,  the amounts  described in Sections
2.3.1 and 2.3.2  shall be treated as paid by the Buyer to the  Sellers  and then
contributed  to  the  Company  by  the  Sellers  (or  in  the  case  of  Selling
Shareholders, to HIRAC, and then to the Company).

         Section 6.8. HIRAC Tax Matters.

         6.8.1.  Tax Indemnification.

                 (i)      Selling Shareholders, severally but not jointly, shall
be liable for and shall pay (and shall  indemnify  and hold Buyer  harmless from
and against) (x) all Taxes with respect to HIRAC for any  Pre-Closing Tax Period
but only to the extent the amount payable exceeds the amount accrued therefor in
the HIRAC  Closing  Date  Balance  Sheet (a "HIRAC  Tax  Loss")  and (y) for any
breaches of the  representations and warranties found in Section 4.9(f) and (g).
The  indemnity  contained  in this  Section 6.8 shall be the sole and  exclusive
remedy for all  breaches  of Section  4.9 or any other Tax  matters  relating to
HIRAC, and shall not be subject to the Deductible Amounts.  For purposes of this
Section  6.8,  (A) the term  "Pre-Closing  Tax  Period"  shall mean all  taxable
periods  ending on or before  the  Closing  Date and the  portion  ending on the
Closing  Date of any  taxable  period  that  includes  (but does not end on) the
Closing Date, and (B) the term  "Post-Closing Tax Period" shall mean all taxable
periods  that  begin on or after  the day  following  the  Closing  Date and the
portion  beginning  after the Closing Date of any taxable  period that  includes
(but  does not end on) the  Closing  Date.  Buyer  shall be  liable  (and  shall
indemnify  and hold Selling  Shareholders  harmless  from and against) any Taxes
with respect to HIRAC attributable to any Post-Closing Tax Period.

                 (ii)     For  purposes of this Section  6.8.1,  in the case of
any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic  basis and are payable for a Tax period
that includes  (but does not end on)


                                       56
<PAGE>

the  Closing  Date,  the  portion of such Tax related to the portion of such Tax
period  ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than
Taxes based upon or related to income,  sales,  gross receipts,  wages,  capital
expenditures or expenses,  be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Tax period  multiplied  by a fraction,  the  numerator of which is the number of
days in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the  denominator  of which
is the number of days in the entire Tax  period,  and (y) in the case of any Tax
based  upon  or  related  to  income,  sales,  gross  receipts,  wages,  capital
expenditures  or expenses,  be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable
if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date. Any  overpayment of Tax by
HIRAC for the Pre-Closing Tax period,  as determined  under this Section 6.8.1.,
shall be taken into account in the calculation of Tangible Net Worth of HIRAC.

                 (iii)    Except as reserved  for in the  Closing  Date  Balance
Sheet, any payment pursuant to this Section 6.8.1 shall be made (x) if reflected
on a Tax Return, contemporaneously with the filing of such Tax Return and (y) in
all other  cases,  not later than  thirty  (30) days after  receipt by  Sellers'
Representative  of written notice from Buyer stating that any HIRAC Tax Loss has
been paid by Buyer or, any of its  Affiliates  or,  effective  upon the Closing,
HIRAC and the amount thereof and of the indemnity payment  requested;  provided,
however,  no  payment  shall be made until the  procedures  set forth in Section
6.8.2 have been complied with.

                 (iv)     If any claim or demand for Taxes in  respect  of which
indemnity  may be sought  pursuant to this Section  6.8.2 is asserted in writing
against  Buyer,  any of its Affiliates  or,  effective upon the Closing,  HIRAC,
Buyer shall  promptly  notify  Sellers'  Representative  of such claim or demand
within  sufficient  time that  would  allow  Sellers'  Representative  to timely
respond to such claim or demand,  and shall give  Sellers'  Representative  such
information  with  respect  thereto  as they may  reasonably  request.  Sellers'
Representative may discharge, at any time, Selling Shareholders' indemnification
obligations  under  this  Section  6.8.1 by paying  to Buyer  the  amount of the
applicable  HIRAC Tax Loss,  calculated  on the date of such  payment.  Sellers'
Representative  may, at Selling  Shareholders' own expense,  participate in and,
upon  notice  to  Buyer,  assume  and  direct  the  defense  of any such  Action
(including any Tax audit). If Sellers'  Representative  assumes such defense and
if the relevant  Action  relates to a taxable period that includes (but does not
end on) the  Closing  Date,  Buyer  shall  have the right  (but not the duty) to
participate  in the defense  thereof to the extent it relates to Taxes for which
Buyer is not entitled to indemnification hereunder and to employ counsel, at its
own  expense,  separate  from the counsel  employed by Sellers'  Representative.
Whether  or not  Sellers'  Representative  chooses  to defend or  prosecute  any
Action,  all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof.

                 (v)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims  related to this
Section 6.8 hereof shall not have a time  limitation with respect to such claims
or any suit instituted with respect thereto,  except for any applicable  statute
of limitations.

         6.8.2.   Return Filings, Refunds and Credits.

                 (i)      Selling Shareholders  and Buyer agree that the taxable
year of HIRAC will end upon the Closing  Date and a new taxable  year will begin
the day after the Closing Date. Sellers'  Representatives shall prepare or cause
to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax


                                       57
<PAGE>

Returns of HIRAC  (including  amended Tax Returns) for Taxable periods ending on
or before the Closing  Date and shall be  responsible  for  remitting  all Taxes
reflected  on such Tax Returns,  net of any  reserves  provided for in the HIRAC
Closing Date Balance  Sheet.  To the extent  amounts are due on such Tax Returns
and reserved for in the HIRAC Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Buyer will advance
the Sellers'  Representative the amount owed. Selling Shareholders shall pay the
cost of preparing  all such Tax Returns.  Copies of all such Tax Returns (for or
including a Pre-Closing Tax Period) shall be furnished to Buyer.

                 (ii)     Buyer  shall  prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed on a timely basis all Tax Returns with respect to HIRAC for
taxable  periods  including  (but not ending on) the Closing  Date  (taking into
account  extensions)  and shall be responsible for remitting all Taxes reflected
on such Tax  Returns.  If  requested  by  Sellers'  Representative,  Buyer shall
furnish copies of all such Tax Returns for the reasonable  review and reasonable
approval of Sellers' Representative.

                 (iii)    Selling  Shareholders   and  Buyer  shall   reasonably
cooperate,  and shall  cause  their  respective  Affiliates,  agents,  auditors,
representatives,  officers and employees  reasonably to cooperate,  in preparing
and filing all Tax Returns  (including  amended  returns and claims for refund),
including  maintaining and making available to each other all records reasonably
required in connection  with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and audits with
respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes. Buyer and Selling Shareholders
agree to retain or cause to be retained all books and records pertinent to HIRAC
until the applicable  period for assessment  under applicable law (giving effect
to any and all extensions or waivers) has expired,  and to abide by or cause the
abidance  with all  record  retention  agreements  entered  into with any taxing
authority. Buyer and Selling Shareholders shall cooperate with each other in the
conduct of any audit or other  proceedings  involving HIRAC for any Tax purposes
and each shall  execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other  documents
as are  necessary  to carry out the  intent of this  subsection.  Any Tax Return
prepared by, or at the direction of, Sellers' Representative pursuant to Section
6.8.2(i) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice and without
a change of any  election or any  accounting  method and shall be  submitted  to
Buyer, if requested,  in sufficient time to permit a reasonable  review prior to
the due date (including  extensions) of such Tax Return.  Buyer will not prepare
any  Tax  Return,   which  includes  a  Pre-Closing  Tax  Period,  in  a  manner
inconsistent  with the past practices of HIRAC which would adversely  affect the
Selling  Shareholders.  Buyer or  Sellers'  Representative,  as the case may be,
shall have the right to review all work  papers and  procedures  used to prepare
any Tax Return. If Buyer or Sellers' Representative, within twenty (20) Business
Days after delivery of any such Tax Return,  notifies the other party in writing
that it objects to any items in such Tax Return,  the parties  shall  proceed in
good faith to resolve the disputed items and, if they are unable to do so within
ten (10)  Business  Days,  the  disputed  items  shall  be  resolved  (within  a
reasonable  time,  taking into  account the deadline for filing such Tax Return)
with  respect  to (i) items for which  Selling  Shareholders  or Buyer is solely
liable by reference to such  party's  treatment  and (ii) all other items by the
Alternative Accountants. Upon resolution of all disputed items, the relevant Tax
Return  shall be adjusted to reflect such  resolution  and shall be binding upon
the parties  without  further  adjustment.  The costs,  fees and expense of such
Alternative  Accountants  shall be borne  equally  by Selling  Shareholders  and
Buyer.

                                       58
<PAGE>

                 (iv)     With respect to Tax refunds  pertaining  to HIRAC  for
any tax period or portion  thereof  ending on or before the Closing Date: (a) if
and to the extent such refund is less than or equal to the  corresponding  asset
reflected on the HIRAC  Closing Date Balance  Sheet,  HIRAC shall be entitled to
retain the entire  amount;  and (b) if and to the extent such refund exceeds the
asset so  reflected,  Selling  Shareholders  shall be  entitled  to such  excess
amount.
                 (v)      If  and to the extent  any Liability  reflected on the
HIRAC Closing Date Balance Sheet for Taxes proves to have been overstated, Buyer
shall pay to the  Sellers'  Account for the benefit of the Selling  Shareholders
cash in the amount of such overstatement.

         6.8.3.  Installment  Sale Reporting.  The Selling  Shareholders and the
Buyer agree for income tax  purposes to treat the sale and purchase of the HIRAC
Shares as an  installment  sale under  Section 453 of the Code and amounts  paid
under Sections 2.3.5 and 2.4 as contingent  payments  subject to the application
of Section 483 of the Code.

         6.8.4. HIRAC shall not make an election to forgo a carryback loss under
Section 172(b)(3) of the Code for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

         Section 6.9. Expenses of Transaction; Accounts.

         6.9.1.  Transaction Costs of Sellers, Company and Subsidiaries.  Except
to the extent  specifically  otherwise  provided  herein,  the Company  shall be
responsible  for all financial  advisory,  legal,  accounting and other fees and
expenses  incurred  by Sellers,  Company,  HIRAC or any of their  Affiliates  in
connection with the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement (which amounts
shall be paid by  Company  prior to the  Closing),  or paid for by the  Sellers'
Representative  out of the  Sellers'  Account  or paid by Buyer  at the  Closing
pursuant to Section 2.3.2.

         6.9.2.  Transaction Costs of Buyer.  Except to the extent  specifically
otherwise  provided  herein,  Buyer shall bear all  financial  advisory,  legal,
accounting and other fees and expenses  incurred by Buyer in connection with the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  and all such  fees and  expenses
incurred by Company or its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing Date.

         Section 6.10. Books and Records; Personnel.

                 (a)      Sellers acknowledge and agree  that from and after the
Closing Date,  Company will be entitled to own and possess,  subject to the next
succeeding sentence,  all documents,  books,  records,  agreements and financial
data of any sort relating to HIRAC, the Company,  the Company's  Subsidiaries or
the Company  Business.  Sellers  agree to deliver and cause their  Affiliates to
deliver, prior to the Closing, all such books and records in their possession to
Company,  as  appropriate,  or, to the  extent  such books and  records  are not
readily  separable  from  the  books  and  records  of  Sellers  or any of their
Affiliates  relating to their businesses other than the Company  Business,  true
and complete copies of such books and records.

                                       59
<PAGE>

                 (b)      From and after the Closing Date and until such time as
all payments due under Article II shall have been made to Sellers,  Buyer shall,
and  shall   cause   Company  to,   allow   Sellers'   Representative   and  his
representatives  reasonable  access  to all books  and  records  of HIRAC or the
Company or its  Subsidiaries or relating to the Company Business (the "Books and
Records") during normal working hours at Buyer's  principal place of business or
at  any  location  where  the  Books  and  Records  are  stored,   and  Sellers'
Representative  shall have the right, at Sellers' expense, to make copies of any
Books and Records;  provided,  however, that any such access or copying shall be
had or done (A) in such a manner so as not to interfere  with the normal conduct
of Buyer's  business or the Company  Business and (B) for a legitimate  business
purpose  (such as tax  preparation)  that does not  involve  direct or  indirect
competition with the Company Business.

         Section 6.11.  Further  Assurances.  Each party, upon the request  from
time to time of any other party hereto after the  Closing,  and without  further
consideration,  will do  each  and  every  act and  thing  as may be  reasonably
requested  to  consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby in an orderly
fashion.

         Section 6.12.  Financial Statement Deliveries.

         6.12.1. Financial  Statements of the Company and HIRAC.  As soon  as is
reasonably practicable following the date hereof and in any event not later than
three (3)  Business  Days after their  preparation  in final  form,  the Company
shall,  at its cost and expense,  cause to be  delivered to Buyer any  unaudited
quarterly financial  statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries or HIRAC, as
applicable,  as are  prepared in the  ordinary  course of business  prior to the
Closing Date. Such unaudited quarterly financial statements shall be prepared in
accordance  with  Company's  GAAP  consistently  applied  throughout the periods
specified  therein,  and shall  present  fairly  in all  material  respects  the
combined  financial  position  and  results of  operations  of  Company  and its
Subsidiaries or HIRAC, as applicable, for the periods specified therein, subject
to an absence of footnotes and to normal year-end audit  adjustments  which will
not in the aggregate be material.

         6.12.2. Financial  Statements  of  Buyer.  As  soon  as  is  reasonably
practicable  following the date hereof and in any event not later than three (3)
Business  Days after their  preparation  in final form,  Buyer shall cause to be
delivered  to the  Company,  at the cost and expense of Buyer,  such  audited or
unaudited financial statements of the Buyer as are prepared prior to the Closing
Date. Buyer shall cause all financial  statements  (including the notes thereto)
referred to in this  Section  6.12.2 to be prepared in  accordance  with Buyer's
GAAP  consistently  applied  throughout the periods  specified  therein,  and to
present fairly in all material respects, the consolidated financial position and
results of operations of Buyer for the periods specified therein, subject in the
case of financial  statements for interim periods to an absence of footnotes and
to  normal  year-end  audit  adjustments  which  will  not in the  aggregate  be
material.

         Section 6.13. No Solicitation or Employment. Except as provided by law,
for a period  beginning on the date hereof and ending on the second  anniversary
of the Closing  Date,  none of the Buyer,  Sellers  nor any of their  Affiliates

to employ or employ any  individual  who is an employee of


                                       60
<PAGE>

Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the date hereof,  or at any time following
the date hereof, unless at least six (6) months shall have elapsed following the
Closing and following the cessation of such individual's  employment with Buyer,
Company or any of their Affiliates.

         Section 6.14. No  Solicitation  of  Proposals  or Offers.  The  parties
hereto shall not, after the date hereof and before the Closing Date, directly or
indirectly,  through  any  officer,  director,  employee,  agent  or  otherwise,
solicit, initiate or encourage submission of proposals or offers from any Person
relating to any  acquisition or purchase of all or a substantial  portion of the
assets of, or any equity  interest in, Buyer, on the one hand, or Company or any
of its  Subsidiaries  or HIRAC,  on the other hand, or any business  combination
involving any of them or, except to the extent required by fiduciary obligations
under Legal Requirements as advised by counsel,  participate in any negotiations
regarding,  or furnish to any other Person any  information  with respect to, or
otherwise  cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or
encourage,  any effort or  attempt by any other  Person to do or seek any of the
foregoing.  The parties shall, to the extent permitted by the terms of each such
party's  confidentiality  agreements  with other  Persons  existing  on the date
hereof,  promptly  advise one  another  if any such  proposal  or offer,  or any
inquiry or contact with any Person with respect thereto, is made, shall promptly
inform one another of all the terms and conditions thereof, and shall furnish to
one another copies of any such written proposal or offer and the contents of any
communications in response thereto.

         Section 6.15. Financing.  Buyer shall notify  Sellers  promptly  in the
event that Buyer  ceases to believe  that any of the  conditions  to the funding
contemplated by the Commitment Letter will be satisfied,  if Buyer becomes aware
of the  existence  of any fact or event that  would  cause  such  conditions  to
funding  not to be  satisfied  or if there  has  been,  or if  Buyer  reasonably
believes  that there may be, any material  change to the status or terms of such
contemplated funding. In addition, upon the request of Sellers'  Representative,
Buyer shall promptly deliver to Sellers'  Representative  in a reasonable amount
of detail any information relating to the funding contemplated by the Commitment
Letter,  including  without  limitation  copies of any amendments or supplements
thereto,  which Sellers'  Representative  shall keep  confidential in accordance
with Section 6.3.

         Section 6.16. Operation of the Company Post-Closing. From and after the
Closing  Date until final  payment of all amounts due  pursuant to Article II of
this  Agreement,  the parties agree that the Company and its  Subsidiaries  will
continue  to  operate  in a manner  consistent  with  past  practices  and their
operations prior to the Closing Date under the direction of the current officers
of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  (and any successor  officers chosen by the
Board of Directors of Company after consultation with such officers). Buyer, its
Affiliates,  directors,  officers  and  employees  shall  not  take  any  action
inconsistent  with the foregoing or make any decision  affecting the operations,
officers,  structure or results of the Company's operations  (including any sale
of  assets or  Equity  Securities  of the  Company  or any of its  Subsidiaries)
without the written  approval of the  Sellers'  Representative.  Nothing in this
Section 6.16 shall be interpreted to prevent Buyer from exercising  control over
the  operations of Company and its  Subsidiaries  after such time as all amounts
due  under  Article  II shall  have  been  paid by  Buyer.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  Buyer shall be permitted, at its sole cost and expense, to implement
its cash management policies (including, but not limited to, causing the Company
to make annual  dividends)  and take any other  actions it may  reasonably  deem
necessary to comply with its reporting requirements as a public


                                       61
<PAGE>
company or Legal  Requirements.  Buyer  shall pay the  Company  interest  on the
Company's  and its  Subsidiaries'  funds paid over to Buyer in  connection  with
Buyer's cash management  policies at the Government Funds Rate.  Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, provided that, to the extent that Buyer pays to
the Sellers under Section 2.5, then,  promptly  thereafter,  Company shall pay a
cash amount to Buyer in the same amount paid to Sellers, and to the extent Buyer
is paid funds under Section 2.5, then  promptly  thereafter,  Buyer shall pay to
the Company the same amount paid to Buyer.  To the extent  Company funds are not
available,  an intercompany  loan bearing  interest equal to the Government Fund
Rate will be provided.  In the event that Buyer is required to exercise  control
over  the  Company's  operations  pursuant  to  Legal  Requirements,   prior  to
implementing  such  control,  Buyer will  discuss such Legal  Requirements  with
Sellers'  Representative  and shall  endeavor to exert such  control in a manner
minimally intrusive to Company's operations, subject to such Legal Requirements.

         Section 6.17. Events Relating to Buyer Common Stock.  Buyer will advise
Seller's  Representative  promptly  (i) of the  issuance  by the SEC of any stop
order  suspending  the  effectiveness  of the  Registration  Statement or of the
suspension of  qualification of the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued to
the Sellers pursuant to Article II for offering or sale in any jurisdiction,  or
the initiation or  contemplation of any proceeding for such purposes and (ii) by
the Closing Date, of the happening of any event that makes any statement made in
the Registration  Statement or the Prospectus  untrue in any material respect or
that  requires  the  making of any  addition  to or  change in the  Registration
Statement  or the  Prospectus  to state a material  fact  required  to be stated
therein or necessary to make the  statements  therein not  misleading  or of the
necessity to amend or supplement  the  Prospectus to comply with the  Securities
Act or any  other  law.  If at any  time the SEC  shall  issue  any  stop  order
suspending the  effectiveness  of the  Registration  Statement,  Buyer will make
every  reasonable  effort to obtain the withdrawal of such order at the earliest
possible time. Buyer shall not be required to maintain the  effectiveness of the
Registration  Statement  under the  Securities Act for the purposes of resale of
the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued to the Sellers pursuant to Article
II by such persons,  provided  that the initial  issuance of all such shares was
duly registered under the Securities Act.

         Section 6.18. Stock Options.  On the Closing Date, Buyer shall grant to
the  employees of the Company  listed in Section 6.18 of the Company  Disclosure
Letter,  pursuant to Buyer's 2000 Stock  Incentive  Plan,  500,000  nonqualified
stock options in the aggregate, each with an exercise price equal to the closing
price of the Buyer  Common  Stock on the New York Stock  Exchange on the Closing
Date. Buyer shall take all actions  necessary to ensure that the shares issuable
upon exercise of such options are registered under the Securities Act and listed
on the New York Stock Exchange as of the Closing Date.

         Section 6.19.  Errors and Omissions Insurance; Directors' and Officers'
Insurance.

         Section 6.19.1. Errors and Omissions Insurance.  After the Closing, the
Company will  continue  its  existing  errors and  omissions  coverage  with the
Company's  current limits and  deductibles,  for all periods arising on or after
the Closing,  and premiums  for such  coverage  shall be included as expenses in
calculating  EBITDA of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided  pursuant to
Section  1.3.17.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if following the Closing the
Company is not  permitted by the carrier to continue  such  existing  errors and
omissions  coverage,

                                       62
<PAGE>
then the Company and its  Subsidiaries  and  Affiliates  shall be covered  under
Buyer's errors and omissions coverage,  and expenses associated with such errors
and omissions coverages shall be treated as provided in Section 1.3.17.

         Section 6.20.  Reserved.

         Section 6.21. Collection of Accounts Receivable.  Following the Closing
Date, Company shall, consistent with its customary business practices and in the
Ordinary Course of Business,  use its reasonable  commercial  efforts to collect
the accounts receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are outstanding
as of the Closing Date (collectively,  the "Closing Date Accounts  Receivable").
On a quarterly  basis for a period of one year from the Closing  Date,  Sellers'
Representative  shall deliver to Buyer a computer generated accounts  receivable
aging report with respect to the Closing Date Accounts  Receivable,  which shall
include the identity of delinquent  accounts by agency office. One year from the
Closing Date,  Buyer shall notify  Sellers'  Representative  of any  uncollected
Closing Date Accounts Receivable and shall provide Sellers'  Representative with
reasonable evidence of such determination. Within fifteen (15) days from Buyer's
notification of the uncollected Closing Date Accounts Receivable,  if any, or as
set forth in the Alternative  Accountants'  determination  as provided below, if
applicable, Selling Members, severally and not jointly, shall pay to Buyer, on a
dollar-for-dollar  basis,  or Buyer may apply its  set-off  rights  pursuant  to
Article X the amount by which the uncollected  Closing Date Accounts  Receivable
less any  corresponding  accounts  payable  (unless  such  accounts  payable are
legally or contractually due even if the corresponding  accounts  receivable are
not collected)  ("Net Closing Date Accounts  Receivable")  exceed the sum of the
accounts receivable reserve set forth on the Company Closing Date Balance Sheet,
or Buyer shall pay to Selling Members, on a dollar-for-dollar  basis, the amount
by which the sum of such accounts receivable reserve exceeds the uncollected Net
Closing Date Accounts Receivable. Sellers' Representative may, by written notice
to Buyer,  dispute such  determination.  If written 15 days after Buyer receives
Sellers'  Representative's  notice of  dispute,  the parties are unable to reach
agreement  as to the  uncollected  Net Closing  Date  Accounts  Receivable,  the
dispute shall be submitted to the  Alternative  Accountants  for resolution with
instructions to determine the  uncollected Net Closing Date Accounts  Receivable
in accordance  with the principles and  definitions set forth in this Agreement.
In such  case,  (i)  Sellers'  Representative  and Buyer  will  furnish  to such
accounting firm such work papers and other documents and information relating to
the disputed  issues as such  accounting  firm may request and are  available to
Sellers'  Representative  and Buyer,  and will be  afforded  an  opportunity  to
present to such accounting firm any material  relating to the  determination and
to discuss the determination  with such accounting firm, (ii) a determination by
such accounting firm of the uncollected Net Closing Date Accounts Receivable, as
set forth in a notice delivered to both parties by such accounting firm no later
than  thirty  (30)  days  after the  issues in  dispute  are  submitted  to such
accounting firm, will be binding and conclusive on the parties, and (iii) Buyer,

twenty  (120)  days   following  the  Closing  Date,   audit  the  accuracy  and

reflected on the Company  Closing Date Balance  Sheet and shall notify  Sellers'

reimburse Sellers'  Representative on behalf of Selling Members in the aggregate
amount of such overstatement. If the actual accounts payable exceeded the amount
reflected  on the Company  Closing  Date Balance  Sheet,  then Selling  Members,
severally  and  not  jointly,  shall  reimburse  Buyer  in the  amount  of  such
understatement.  Any amount due hereunder,  whether due from Selling  Members or
Buyer,  shall be paid  within  thirty  (30) days from  Buyer's  notification  to

Representative,  and  will  be  afforded  an  opportunity  to  present  to  such
accounting firm any material  relating to the  determination  and to discuss the
determination with such accounting firm, (ii) a determination by such accounting
firm of accounts payable,  as set forth in a notice delivered to both parties by
such  accounting firm no later than thirty (30) days after the issues in dispute
are submitted to such  accounting  firm,  will be binding and  conclusive on the
parties,  and (iii) Buyer, on the one hand, and Selling  Members,  on the other,
will each bear fifty percent (50%) of the fees of such  accounting firm for such
determination.

         Section 6.23. Disclosure Documents.  Promptly after the Execution Date,

into a newly-formed  subsidiary of Buyer,  with HIRAC surviving such merger.  In
connection  with such  restructuring,  the parties to this Agreement would enter
into appropriate merger agreements, indemnity agreements and other agreements to

breach  of  Section  (a) and  that  the  Buyer  shall be  entitled  to  specific
performance of the covenants and agreements contained herein. The Company, HIRAC
and Messrs. Golub, McGrath,  McNulty and Donovan each consent to the entry of an

venue,  and acknowledge  that Buyer is relying upon the covenants and agreements
contained herein in executing this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Buyer's  right to specific  performance  hereunder  shall not be  construed as a
limitation on any other  remedies to which the Buyer may be entitled  under this
Agreement or applicable law.

jointly, hereby agree to indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates (including,  without
limitation,  Company and each  Subsidiary of Company from and after the Closing)
(each in its capacity as indemnified party for the purpose of this Section 10.1,
a "Buyer Indemnitee"),  and hold each Buyer Indemnitee  harmless,  from, against
and in respect of any and all Losses arising from any of the following:

                  (i)  any  breach  of  any representation  or warranty  made by
         the  Company  in  Article  III of this  Agreement  (including,  without
         limitation,  the Company  Disclosure  Letter but excluding Section 3.13
         and any other matters  relating to Taxes,  as to which Buyer's sole and
         exclusive remedy is provided in Section 6.7 and Section 6.8), provided,
         however,  as to the representations in each of Section 3.1.2, the first
         sentence of Section  3.1.3 and Section  3.1.5,  each Seller  shall only
         provide   indemnification   hereunder   to   the   extent   that   such
         representations as they relate to such Seller have been breached; or

                  (ii)   any   breach,  non-fulfillment   or  violation  of  any
         covenant or agreement made by the Company or Sellers in this Agreement.

         Notwithstanding  the fact that the  representations  and warranties set
forth in Article III hereof are made by the Company and not by the Sellers,  and
subject  to the terms of  Article X, each of the  Sellers  hereby  agrees to and
accepts:

                  (i) liability for the indemnification obligations set forth in
         Section 10.1 above;

                  (ii) no limitation on the amount that Buyer is able to recover
         from a Selling  Member with  respect to an  indemnification  obligation
         solely  on  account  of the  fact  that  (1)  the  representations  and
         warranties  set forth in Article III hereof are made by the Company and
         not by the Selling Members,  or (2) the  indemnification  obligation is
         subject to  limitation or  mitigation  under the  Company's  Charter or
         applicable  law,  because  the  obligation  arises from or relates to a
         Selling Member's actions as an officer or director of the Company; and

                  (iii) this  indemnification  obligation  is one of payment and
         not of  collection,  and  Buyer  shall  have  no  duty,  obligation  or
         requirement to exhaust any other remedy  available to it from any other
         Person prior to seeking satisfaction from any of the Selling Members of
         the required indemnification obligation,  except as expressly set forth
         herein  with  respect to any  requirement  for Buyer to use its set-off
         rights under Article X.

         Section 10.2.  Indemnification by Selling Shareholders.

         (a) In addition to their Tax indemnification  obligations under Section
6.8 hereof,  Selling  Shareholders hereby agree to indemnify and hold each Buyer
Indemnitee harmless,  from, against and in respect of any and all Losses arising
from or related to any of the following:

                                       72
<PAGE>

                  (i) any breach of any  representation  or warranty made by the
         Company in Article IV of this Agreement (including, without limitation,
         the HIRAC  Disclosure  Letter but excluding  Section 4.9; and any other
         matters  relating  to Taxes,  as to which  Buyer's  sole and  exclusive
         remedy is provided in Section 6.7 and Section 6.8)  provided,  however,
         as to the  representations in each of Section 4.1.2, the first sentence
         of Section 4.1.3, and Section 4.5, each Selling  Shareholder shall only
         provide   indemnification   hereunder   to   the   extent   that   such
         representations  as they relate to such Selling  Shareholder  have been
         breached;

         (b)  Notwithstanding  the fact that the  representations and warranties
set forth in Article IV hereof are made by the  Company  and not by the  Selling
Shareholders,  and except as  otherwise  provided in this Article X, each of the
Selling Shareholders hereby agrees to and accepts:

                  (i) liability for the indemnification obligations set forth in
         Section 10.2 above;

                  (ii) no limitation on the amount that Buyer is able to recover
         from  a  Selling   Shareholder  with  respect  to  an   indemnification
         obligation  solely on account of the fact that (1) the  representations
         and  warranties set forth in Article III hereof are made by the Company
         and  not by  the  Selling  Shareholders,  or  (2)  the  indemnification
         obligation is subject to  limitation or mitigation  under the Company's
         Charter or  applicable  law,  because  the  obligation  arises  from or
         relates to a Selling Shareholder's actions as an officer or director of
         the Company; and

                  (iii) this  indemnification  obligation  is one of payment and
         not of  collection,  and  Buyer  shall  have  no  duty,  obligation  or
         requirement to exhaust any other remedy  available to it from any other
         Person  prior  to  seeking   satisfaction   from  any  of  the  Selling
         Shareholders  of the  required  indemnification  obligation,  except as
         expressly set forth herein with respect to any requirement for Buyer to
         use its set-off rights under Article X.

         Section  10.3  Indemnification  by Buyer.  Buyer  hereby  agrees to
indemnify Sellers and their Affiliates  (other than, after the Closing,  Company
or any of its  Subsidiaries)  (each in its  capacity as  indemnified  party,  an
"Seller  Indemnitee,"  and,   collectively  with  the  Buyer  Indemnitees,   the
"Indemnitees"), and hold Sellers and their Affiliates harmless from, against and
in  respect  of any  and  all  Losses  arising  from  or  related  to any of the
following:

                  (i)  any breach of any representation  or warranty  made by or
         Buyer in this Agreement; or

                  (ii) any breach, non-fulfillment  or violation of any covenant
         or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement.

         Section 10.4  Time  Limitation on Indemnification.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing,  no claim may be made or suit  instituted  under any provision of
this Article X more than two (2) years  following the Closing Date (the "General
Survival  Period") except for Reserved Claims.  The term "Reserved Claims" shall
mean (a) all claims as to which any Indemnitee has given any indemnifying  party
written notice on or prior to the end of the General  Survival  Period,  (b) all

                                       73
<PAGE>

claims  by  any  Indemnitee  based  upon a  breach  of  the  representations  or
warranties  contained in (with respect to the Selling  Members):  Sections 3.1.4
(Capitalization),  3.1.5 (Title to Company Shares) and  3.14.2(c)(vi)  (Employee
Relations   and   Employee   Benefit   Plans)  and  (with   respect  to  Selling
Shareholders): Sections 4.1.4 (Capitalization) and 4.1.5 (Title to HIRAC Shares)
and (c) all claims based upon fraud. As to the Reserved  Claims,  there shall be
no time  limitation  with respect to any such claims or any suit instituted with
respect thereto, other than any applicable statute of limitations.

         Section 10.5   Monetary Limitations on Indemnification.

         10.5.1. Monetary Limitations on Sellers'  Indemnification  Obligations.
Except  with  respect  to  claims  referred  to in  clauses  (b)  or  (c) of the
definition of Reserved Claims:

                  (a)  Neither   Sellers  nor  Selling  Shareholders  shall have
any  obligation  to indemnify  Buyer  Indemnitees  under Section 10.1 or Section
10.2,  respectively,  unless the aggregate cumulative total of all indemnifiable
Losses  (other than Losses  arising out of claims  referred to in clauses (b) or
(c) of the  definition of Reserved  Claims)  incurred by Buyer and/or any of its
Affiliates  exceed $375,000,  whereupon Buyer  Indemnitees  shall be entitled to
indemnification  only for the amount of such Losses in excess of  $375,000  (the
"Deductible  Amount").  With respect to claims referred to in clauses (b) or (c)
of the definition of Reserved Claims, no such limitations shall apply.

                  (b)  Notwithstanding  anything   contained   herein   to   the
contrary, but subject to Section 10.5.1(c),  the sole source of recovery for all
claims made by Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to this Article X shall be the amount,
if any, payable pursuant to Section 2.3.5 and 60% of the amount, if any, payable
pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof "the  "Indemnity  Cap"),  and (subject to Section
10.5.1(c)) Buyer  Indemnitees'  sole and exclusive remedy with respect to Losses
actually determined to be subject to indemnification hereunder, shall be a right
of set-off  against  those  amounts,  if any, so payable under Section 2.3.5 and
Section 2.4.

                  (c)   Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of this Agreement
to the  contrary,  Buyer shall be entitled to recover from each  Seller,  solely
pursuant  to a claim  referred  to in clauses  (b) or (c) of the  definition  of
Reserved  Claims,  an amount up to a limit with  respect to such Seller equal to
the  amount  of  consideration  actually  received  by such  Seller  under  this
Agreement. Any such recovery shall first be made by way of set-off in accordance
with Section 10.5.1(b).

         Furthermore,  except  with  respect to a breach of  Section  3.1.5 with
respect to Conning,  no  recovery  shall be made under this  Agreement  (whether
pursuant to this Article X or otherwise)  against any amounts paid to Conning at
the Closing (the "Conning  Preferred Return") unless and until recovery has been
reasonably  attempted to be made against all other amounts paid to Sellers other
than the Conning  Preferred  Return.  Each Seller other than Conning agrees that
Conning may seek contribution  against such Seller to the extent such Seller has
not paid to Buyer all of the  consideration  received by such Seller  hereunder.
The foregoing provision is only intended to offset the allocation of liabilities
among the Sellers and shall not reduce the aggregate amount recoverable by Buyer
hereunder.

<PAGE>

         10.5.2.  Other  Limitations  on Sellers'  Indemnification  Obligations.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Sellers shall in no event
be  obligated  to pay to Buyer or its  Affiliates  any  special,  consequential,
punitive or lost profits  damage or diminution in value suffered by Buyer or its
Affiliates.

         10.5.3.  Monetary Limitations on Buyer's  Indemnification  Obligations.
Except  with  respect  to  claims  based  on  fraud,  Buyer  shall  not have any
obligation to indemnify Sellers or any of their Affiliates under Section 10.3 in
respect of any Loss incurred by Sellers  and/or any of their  Affiliates  unless
the aggregate  cumulative  total of all Losses (other than Losses arising out of
claims  based on fraud)  incurred  by  Sellers  and/or  any of their  Affiliates
exceeds the Deductible  Amount,  whereupon  Sellers and each of their Affiliates
shall be entitled to indemnification  for the amount of such Losses in excess of
the Deductible Amount. With respect to claims based on fraud, no such deductible
shall apply. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the maximum amount
of the aggregate  liability of Buyer and its Affiliates for any  indemnification
obligations hereunder shall be an amount equal to the Indemnity Cap.

         Section 10.6   Third Party  Claims.  Promptly  after the receipt by any
Indemnitee of notice of the  commencement  of any Action against such Indemnitee
by a third  party  (other  than any Action  relating to Taxes or any Tax Return,
which shall be governed by Sections  6.7 and 6.8) such  Indemnitee  shall,  if a
claim with  respect  thereto is or may be made  against any  indemnifying  party
pursuant to this Article X, give such indemnifying party written notice thereof.
The failure to give such notice  shall not relieve any  indemnifying  party from
any obligation  thereunder except where, and then solely to the extent that, the
omission results in a failure of actual notice to the indemnifying party and the
indemnifying  party is  materially  harmed as a result of such  failure  to give
notice.  Such indemnifying  party shall have the right to defend such Action, at
such  indemnifying  party's  expense and with  counsel of its choice  reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee, provided that the indemnifying party so notifies
the Indemnitee that it will defend such Action. If the indemnifying  party fails
to defend or, after  undertaking  such defense,  fails to prosecute or withdraws
from such defense,  the Indemnitee shall have the right to undertake the defense
and settlement thereof;  provided, that the indemnifying party shall be entitled
to notice of and to participate in any  settlement  discussions  with respect to
any such  Action.  If the  indemnifying  party is  defending  such  Action,  the
Indemnitee  may retain  separate  counsel at its sole cost and  expense  and may
participate in defense of such Action. An indemnifying  party may only settle an
Action  with  the  consent  of  the  Indemnitee,  which  consent  shall  not  be
unreasonably  withheld  or  delayed;  provided,  that no such  consent  shall be
required  where  such  compromise  or  settlement  provides  for (i)  payment of
monetary  damages,  which monetary damages are paid in fully by the indemnifying
party,  and (ii) a full  release  of the  indemnifying  party  from  all  claims
comprising such Action.

         Section  10.7  No  Circular  Recovery.   Solely  with  respect  to  any
Action brought by Buyer or any of its  Affiliates  against  Sellers  pursuant to
this  Agreement,  Sellers  hereby  agree  that  they will not make any claim for
indemnification  against Buyer,  Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  (except in
connection  with valid  insurance  claims under Section  10.10) by reason of the
fact  that any of the  Sellers  was a  controlling  person,  director,  officer,
employee, agent or


                                       75
<PAGE>

other  representative  of Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  or was serving as
such for another Person at the request of Company or any Subsidiary of Company.

         Section  10.8.  Nature  of  Indemnification   Payments.   Any  and  all
indemnification  payments  pursuant  to this  Article X shall be deemed  for all
purposes  to be  adjustments  to the  purchase  consideration  paid  pursuant to
Article II.

         Section 10.9 Sole Remedy. The rights to indemnification provided for in
Article VI and this Article X shall  constitute the sole remedy of Buyer and its
Affiliates  with respect to any matter in any way relating to this  Agreement or
arising in  connection  herewith,  whether  under any laws  (including,  without
limitation,  any right or remedy  under the Resource  Conservation  and Recovery
Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and
any other Environmental Law), at common law or otherwise.

         Section  10.10  Insurance  and  Related  Matters.  Payments  by Sellers
pursuant to Section 6.7 and Section 10.1 and by Selling Shareholders pursuant to
Section 6.8 and  Section  10.2 shall be limited to the amount of any Losses that
remain after  deducting  therefrom  any  insurance  proceeds and any  indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment actually recovered by indemnified  parties
from any third party with respect thereto. The indemnified parties shall exhaust
all remedies  reasonably  available against applicable insurers prior to seeking
indemnification  hereunder.  The amount of Losses  otherwise  recoverable  under
Section 6.7,  Section 10.1,  Section 6.8 or Section 10.2 shall be reduced to the
extent any Federal,  state,  local or foreign tax liabilities of the indemnified
parties (or any of their  respective  Affiliates)  is decreased by reason of any
Loss  in  respect  of  which  such  indemnified   party  shall  be  entitled  to
indemnification under Article VI or this Article X.

         Section 10.11.  No Double  Recovery.  Any Loss for which Buyer received
indemnification under this Agreement shall be disregarded and not included as an
expense or otherwise for purposes of  calculating  the Company's  EBITDA for any
purposes  under  this  Agreement,  and  any  cost  or  expense  included  in the
calculation  of the Company's  EBITDA or the  Company's or HIRAC's  Closing Date
Tangible  Net  Worth  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  shall  not  be  subject  to
indemnification  claims under this  Agreement.  In  addition,  there shall be no
recovery in respect of any breach of Section 3.3(b)(iii) to the extent Buyer has
collected amounts in accordance with Section 2.5.1.


                                   ARTICLE XI

                     Consent to Jurisdiction; Governing Law
                     --------------------------------------

         Section 11.1. Consent to Jurisdiction. Each party to this Agreement, by
its execution hereof, (i) hereby irrevocably  submits,  and agrees to cause each
of its Affiliates to submit, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts
located in the City of  Wilmington,  Delaware and in the event that such federal
courts shall not have subject matter jurisdiction over the relevant  proceeding,
then of the state courts  located in the City of Wilmington,  Delaware,  for the
purpose of any Action arising out of or based upon this Agreement or any Closing
Agreement  or  relating  to  the  subject   matter  hereof  or  thereof  or  the
transactions  contemplated hereby or thereby,


                                       76
<PAGE>

(ii) hereby waives,  to the extent not prohibited by applicable  law, and agrees
not to assert,  and agrees not to allow any of its Affiliates to assert,  by way
of motion, as a defense or otherwise,  in any such Action,  any claim that it is
not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named  courts,  that its
property  is  exempt or  immune  from  attachment  or  execution,  that any such
proceeding  brought in one of the above-named  courts is improper,  or that this
Agreement  or any other  Closing  Agreement,  or the  subject  matter  hereof or
thereof,  may not be enforced in or by such court and (iii) hereby agrees not to
commence any Action  arising out of or based upon this  Agreement or any Closing
Agreement or relating to the subject  matter hereof or thereof other than before
one of the  above-named  courts nor to make any motion or take any other  action
seeking or  intending to cause the transfer or removal of any such Action to any
court  other  than one of the  above-named  courts  whether  on the  grounds  of
inconvenient  forum or  otherwise.  Each  party  hereby  consents  to service of
process in any such  proceeding  in any manner  permitted  by Delaware  law, and
agrees that service of process by registered or certified  mail,  return receipt
requested,  at  its  address  specified  pursuant  to  Section  14.7  hereof  is
reasonably calculated to give actual notice.

         Section 11.2.  Governing Law. This  Agreement  shall be governed by and
construed  in  accordance  with the  domestic  substantive  law of the  State of
Delaware,  without  giving  effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule that would cause the application of the law of any other jurisdiction.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                   Termination
                                   -----------

         Section  12.1.   Termination  of  Agreement.   This  Agreement  may  be
terminated by the parties only as provided below:

                  (a) Buyer  and  Sellers'  Representative  may  terminate  this
Agreement by mutual written consent at any time prior to the Closing.

                  (c) Buyer  may  terminate  this  Agreement  by giving  written
notice to  Sellers'  Representative  at any time prior to the Closing (i) in the
event the Company shall have breached any of its representations,  warranties or
covenants  set forth in this  Agreement,  which breach or failure to perform (A)
would give rise to a failure of a condition  set forth in Section 7.1 and (B) is
incapable  of being  cured by the  Company  within 30  calendar  days  following
receipt of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from Buyer,  (ii)
in the event that the information  provided in the update delivered  pursuant to
Section  7.7  reflects  a  Material  Adverse  Effect  on  the  Company  and  its
Subsidiaries  taken as a whole,  or (iii) if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before July 31, 2002 by reason of the failure of any  condition  set forth
in Article VII hereof to be  satisfied  (unless the failure  resulted  primarily
from Buyer's action or failure to act).

<PAGE>

                  (d)  Sellers'  Representative,  on behalf of  Sellers  and the
Company,  may terminate  this Agreement by giving written notice to Buyer at any
time prior to the Closing (i) in the event Buyer shall have  breached any of its

breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to a failure of a condition set
forth in Section  8.1 and (B) is  incapable  of being  cured by Buyer  within 30
calendar days  following  receipt of written notice of such breach or failure to
perform from Sellers' Representative, (ii) if Buyer has sent any notice required

6.15 and fails to do so, or (iii) if the Closing  shall not have  occurred on or
before  July 31,  2002 by reason of the  failure of any  condition  set forth in
Article VIII hereof to be satisfied (unless the failure resulted  primarily from
the Company's or any Seller's action or failure to act).

         Section 12.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of
this  Agreement  pursuant  to  Section  12.1,  all  obligations  of the  parties
hereunder   (other  than  the  obligations   under  Sections  6.9  (Expenses  of

         Section 13.  Sellers' Representative.

                  (a)  By the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each
Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Thomas A. Golub, John Clinton

                           (ii) to execute and deliver all ancillary agreements,
certificates and documents,  and to make representations and warranties therein,
on behalf of such Seller which


                                       78

the Sellers'  Representative  deems  necessary or appropriate in connection with

                           (iv) to do or refrain  from doing any  further act or
deed on behalf of such Seller which the Sellers'  Representative deems necessary
or  appropriate  in its sole  discretion  relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement,  as fully  and  completely  as such  Seller  could  do if  personally

Agreement.

                  (b)   The  appointment of the Sellers' Representative shall
be deemed  coupled with an interest  and shall be  irrevocable,  and Buyer,  its
affiliates and any other Person may conclusively  and absolutely  rely,  without
inquiry, upon any action of the Sellers' Representative on behalf of the Sellers
in all matters referred to herein. All notices delivered by Buyer or the Company
(following the Closing) to the Sellers'  Representative (whether pursuant hereto
or  otherwise)  for the benefit of the Sellers  shall  constitute  notice to the
Sellers.  The  Sellers'  Representative  shall act for the Sellers on all of the
matters set forth in this  Agreement in the manner the  Sellers'  Representative
believes  to be in the best  interest of the  Sellers  and  consistent  with its
obligations under this Agreement,  but the Sellers'  Representative shall not be
responsible  to the  Sellers  for any loss or  damages  it or they may suffer by
reason of the  performance  by the Sellers'  Representative  of its duties under
this Agreement,  other than loss or damage arising from willful violation of the
law.

                  (c)  Each Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Sellers'  Representative  from any loss,  damage  or  expense  arising  from the
performance of its duties as the Sellers' Representative  hereunder,  including,
without  limitation,  the  cost  of  legal  counsel  retained  by  the  Sellers'
Representative on behalf of the Seller, but excluding any loss or damage arising
from willful violation of the law.

                  (d)   Mr.  Golub shall have full power of substitution with
respect to himself and Mr.  MacGinnitie  for all purposes of this Article  XIII.
Mr.  Golub or his  substitute  shall have full power to remove and  replace  Mr.
MacGinnitie  or his  substitute.  Conning  shall  have full  power to remove and
replace Mr. Clinton or his substitute. All actions of Sellers' Representative to
be  taken  hereunder  must  be  authorized  by at  least  two of the  Individual
Representatives. Prior to any material determination by Sellers' Representative,
each  Individual  Representative  shall  receive  10  days  notice,  appropriate
information   and  an   opportunity   to  be  heard  by  the  other   Individual
Representatives.

                  (e) All actions, decisions and  instructions  of the  Sellers'
Representative  taken,  made or given  pursuant to the authority  granted to the
Sellers'  Representative  pursuant to this Article XIII shall be conclusive  and
binding upon each Seller, and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent,
protest or otherwise contest the same.

                  (f)  The provisions of this Article XIII are  independent  and
severable,  shall constitute an irrevocable  power of attorney,  coupled with an
interest  and  surviving  death or  dissolutions,  granted  by the Seller to the
Sellers'  Representative  and shall be binding upon the executors,  heirs, legal
representatives, successors and assigns of each such Seller.


                                   ARTICLE XIV

                                  Miscellaneous
                                  -------------

         Section 14.1. Entire Agreement;  Waivers.  This Agreement,  the Closing
Agreements and the  Confidentiality  Agreement  constitute the entire  agreement
among the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations
and  discussions,  whether oral or written,  of the parties with respect to such
subject matter.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed or
shall  constitute  a  waiver  of any  other  provision  hereof  (whether  or not
similar),  shall  constitute  a continuing  waiver  unless  otherwise  expressly
provided or shall be effective unless in writing and executed (i) in the case of
a waiver by Buyer,  by Buyer  and (ii) in the case of a waiver  by  Sellers,  by
Sellers' Representative.

         Section 14.2.  Amendment or  Modification.  The parties  hereto may not
amend or modify this Agreement  except in such manner as may be agreed upon by a
written instrument executed and delivered by Buyer and Sellers'  Representative;
provided,  that no amendment or  modification to this Agreement may be made that
would  adversely  affect  (i)  the  limitation  of  liability  of a  Seller  for
indemnification  hereunder or (ii) the  consideration to be received by a Seller
in a manner that is  disproportionate  relative  to the  adverse  effect of such
amendment or modification on other Sellers, without such Seller's consent.

         Section 14.3. Survival. All representations,  warranties, covenants and
agreements  made  by  or on  behalf  of  any  party  hereto  in  this  Agreement
(including,  without limitation,  in all of the Disclosure Letters), or pursuant
to any document, certificate or other instrument referred to herein or delivered
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be deemed to have
been  material  and  relied  upon by the  parties  hereto,  notwithstanding  any
investigation  made  by or on  behalf  of  any  of  the  parties  hereto  or any
opportunity  therefor  (including without limitation the availability for review
of any document), and, subject to the provisions of Article X, shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Closing.  Neither the period of
survival  nor  the   liability  of  any  party  with  respect  to  such  party's
representations,  warranties  covenants and  agreements  shall be reduced by any
investigation  made at any time by or on behalf of any party.  If written notice
of a claim has been given prior to the  expiration  of any time period set forth
herein  for any such  notice  by a party in whose  favor  such  representations,
warranties,  covenants or agreements  have been made to any party that made such
representations,   warranties,   covenants  or  agreements,  then  the  relevant
representations,  warranties,  covenants or agreements  shall survive as to such
claim until such claims have been finally resolved.

         Section 14.4.  Independence  of  Representations  and  Warranties.  The
parties hereto intend that each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement
contained herein shall have independent significance.  If any party has breached
any  representation,  warranty,  covenant or agreement  contained  herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists any other representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement  relating to the same subject  matter  (regardless  of the relative
levels of specificity) that the party has not breached shall not detract from or
mitigate  the fact  that such  party is in  breach of the first  representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

         Section 14.5.   Severability.  In the event that any  provision  hereof
would,  under applicable law, be invalid or  unenforceable in any respect,  such
provision shall (to the extent  permitted under  applicable law) be construed by
modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent
compatible with, and possible under,  applicable law. The provisions  hereof are
severable,  and in the event any  provision  hereof  should be held  invalid  or
unenforceable in any respect, it shall not invalidate,  render  unenforceable or
otherwise affect any other provision hereof.

         Section 14.6.  Successors and Assigns.  All of the terms and provisions
of this  Agreement  shall be binding  upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties  hereto  and their  respective  transferees,  successors  and  permitted
assigns (each of which such transferees,  successors and permitted assigns shall
be deemed to be a party hereto for all purposes hereof); provided, however, that
neither  Sellers  nor  Buyer may  assign or  transfer  (by  operation  of law or
otherwise) any of their respective rights or obligations hereunder.

         Section 14.7. Notices. Any notices or other communications  required or
permitted  hereunder  shall  be  sufficiently  given  if in  writing  (including
telecopy or similar teletransmission), addressed as follows:
