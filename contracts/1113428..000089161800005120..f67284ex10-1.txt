                                   ARTICLE 2

                       THE MERGER AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

         2.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined below), Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease. Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the conditions to
Closing set forth in Section 7.3(e) are not satisfied because none of the
counsel referred to therein is able to opine that the Merger shall be treated
for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code due to the adjustments set forth in Section 2.4(d)
below, then the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub (such a merger
shall also be referred to as the "Merger") and the separate existence of the
Company shall cease, and in such an event, Merger Sub shall be the Surviving
Corporation, if such changed form of Merger would permit the conditions to
Closing set forth in Section 7.3(e) to be satisfied. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law"), and at the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall possess all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises and
be subject to all of the restrictions, liabilities, and duties of Company and
Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware Law.

         2.2 Effective Time of the Merger. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (as defined in
Article 8 of this Agreement), a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") shall be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged by Company and Merger
Sub and thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
for filing in accordance with Delaware Law. The Merger shall become effective
upon the later to occur of the acceptance of such filing by the Secretary of

Merger Consideration, if any, to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement (or, in
the case of Company Options, reserved for issuance) shall be correspondingly
adjusted, and the exercise price for the assumed Company Options shall be

Ratios or the number of shares of Parent Common Stock and amount of Cash Merger

the stockholders of Company, but shall be delivered at the Effective Time to the
Escrow Agent (as defined in Section 9.3(a) hereof) to be held and


                                      -6-
<PAGE>   12
distributed in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 hereof and the Escrow
Agreement; provided, however, that in the event the holders of Series C
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive Cash Merger Consideration as set

Common Stock received by each former holder Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to

delivered at the Effective Time to the Escrow Agent (as defined in Section
9.3(a) hereof) to be held and distributed in accordance with the provisions of
Article 9 hereof and the Escrow Agreement. All shares of Parent Common Stock
delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 2.4(f) shall be
collectively known as the "Escrow Shares."

         (g) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Capital Stock
("Holder") who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to be received by such Holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) the fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such Holder would otherwise be
entitled, times (ii) the Closing Stock Price. The "Closing Stock Price" shall
mean the average closing price of the Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq for the five
(5) trading day period ending two (2) trading days prior to the Closing Date.

         (h) Dissenting Shares; Dissenting Stockholders. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no share of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, the holder of which (a "Dissenting Stockholder") has

262 of Delaware Law (a "Dissenting Share"), shall be converted into the right to
receive any Merger Shares and/or cash and/or cash in lieu of fractional Merger
Shares, but such Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive such
consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law
with respect to such Dissenting Share; provided that if any such Dissenting
Stockholder shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
otherwise lost his, her or its rights to appraisal under Delaware Law, each of
such Dissenting Stockholder's Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into the right to receive the number of Merger Shares and/or
cash, in accordance with Section 2.4(c) or 2.4(d), as the case may be (and
including cash in lieu of fractional shares, as provided in Section 2.4(g)),
applicable thereto as if such Dissenting Share had not been a Dissenting Share
at the Effective Time, without any interest thereon, and such share shall
thereupon no longer be a Dissenting Share. Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal in respect of any shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law (including, without
limitation, instruments concerning appraisal or dissenters' rights) and received
by Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for the exercise of dissenters' rights in respect of any shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.

         2.5 Issuance and Exchange of Certificates

         (a) Parent to Make Common Stock Available. At the Closing, Parent shall
irrevocably deposit (or cause to be deposited) with an exchange agent reasonably
satisfactory to the Holders' Representative (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
benefit of the Holders, for exchange in accordance with this Agreement, through
such reasonable procedures as Parent and the Holders' Representative may jointly
adopt, (i) the Merger Shares (less the Escrow Shares), (ii) cash in respect of
the Cash Merger Consideration (if any) and (iii) cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.4(g).

         (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock (collectively, the "Certificates") whose shares are being converted into
the right to receive Merger Shares (excluding Dissenting Shares) and Cash Merger
Consideration (if any, and as applicable), (i) a letter of transmittal which
shall specify that delivery shall be effective, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent and have such other customary provisions (but including an
assignment in blank to be deposited into Escrow necessary to effect any transfer
of Escrow Shares to Parent in accordance with Article 9 and the Escrow
Agreement) as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting
the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger Shares and Cash
Merger Consideration (if any, and as applicable). Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange
Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock and/or Cash Merger Consideration, if any, and payments in lieu of
fractional shares to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(f)
and is represented by the Certificate so surrendered. The Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Capital Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of Company, the stock certificates representing shares of Parent Common
Stock and/or Cash Merger Consideration, if any (and cash in lieu of fractional
shares) may be delivered to a transferee if the Certificate representing the
right to receive such Parent Common Stock and/or Cash Merger Consideration, if
any (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) is presented to the Exchange Agent
and accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Parent
shall (and shall cause the Exchange Agent to) follow the same procedure with
respect to lost, stolen or mutilated Certificates as it follows with respect to
lost, stolen or mutilated Parent certificates. Unless and until any such
Certificate shall be so surrendered, or such procedures respecting lost, stolen
or mutilated Certificates are followed, the holders of the Certificate shall not
be entitled to receive certificates for the Parent Common Stock and/or Cash
Consideration, if any or cash for any fractional share of Parent Common Stock
and any dividends paid or other distributions made to holders of record of
Parent Common Stock after the Effective Time shall be paid to and retained by
the Exchange Agent and paid over to such holder when such Certificate is
surrendered or such procedures are implemented in accordance with this Section
2.5(b). Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability to
any holder or former holder of capital stock of Company for any shares of Parent


                                      -8-
<PAGE>   14
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any
cash amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

         (c) Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Certificates surrendered in exchange for Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu
of fractional shares) and/or Cash Consideration, if any, by any "Affiliate" (as
determined pursuant to Section 6.7) of Company shall not be exchanged for
certificates representing Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional
shares) and/or Cash Consideration, if any, until Parent has received a written
Affiliate Agreement from such person as provided in Section 6.7 hereof.

         2.6 No Further Ownership Rights in Stock. All Parent Common Stock
and/or Cash Consideration, if any, delivered upon the surrender for exchange of
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock in accordance with
the terms hereof (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares) shall be
deemed to have been delivered in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of stock. There shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged upon the terms and conditions provided in this Article 2.

         2.7 Tax Treatment. The parties intend that the transactions
contemplated hereby will be a reorganization within the meaning of section 368
of the Code and hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the Treasury Regulations.

         4.9 Proprietary Rights.

         (a) Parent owns or possesses valid and enforceable licenses or other
rights to use all Proprietary Rights currently used in the business of Parent,
and the same are sufficient to conduct Parent's business as it has been and is
now being conducted. Schedule 4.9(b) describes which such Proprietary Rights are
owned by Parent (the "Parent Proprietary Rights") and which such Proprietary
Rights are third-party-owned rights used by Parent in the conduct of its
business. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.9(b), Parent is the owner of all
right, title, and interest in and to each of the Parent Proprietary Rights, free
and clear of all liens, security interests, charges, encumbrances, equities, and
other adverse claims (other than Permitted Liens), and has the right to use,
sell, license, sublicense, assign and dispose, in each case without payment to a
third party, all of the Parent Proprietary Rights and the products, processes
and materials covered thereby. Parent has licenses or possesses other rights to
use Proprietary Rights that are not Parent Proprietary Rights. Schedule 4.9(a)
sets forth a complete and accurate list of all material licenses, sublicenses
and similar agreements to which Parent is a party pursuant to which any other
person is authorized to use, exercise or receive any material benefit from any
Parent Proprietary Rights. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.9(b), there is no
contract pursuant to which

                                     - 31-
<PAGE>   37
any Person has any right (whether or not currently exercisable) to use, license
or otherwise exploit any Parent Proprietary Right.

(b) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.9(c), (i) the operations of Parent as
currently conducted do not conflict with or infringe, and no person or entity
has asserted to Parent that such operations or past operations conflict with or
infringe, any Proprietary Rights owned, possessed or used by any third party;
(ii) there are no claims, disputes, actions, proceedings, suits or appeals
pending against Parent with respect to any Proprietary Rights, and, to the
knowledge of Parent, none has been threatened against Parent; (iii) to Parent's
knowledge, there are no facts which would reasonably serve as a basis for any
bona fide claim that Parent does not have the right to use and to transfer the
right to use, free of any rights or claims of others, all Parent Proprietary
Rights in the development, manufacture, use, sale or other disposition of any or
all products or services presently being used, furnished or sold in the conduct
of the business of Parent as it has been and is now being conducted; (iv) to
Parent's knowledge, there is no unauthorized use, infringement or
misappropriation of any of such Parent Proprietary Rights by any third party,
including any employee or former employee of Parent, nor is there any breach of
any license, sublicense or other agreement authorizing another party to use such
Parent Proprietary Rights; and (v) Parent has not entered into any agreement (x)
granting any third party the right to bring infringement actions with respect
to, or otherwise to enforce rights with respect to, any such Proprietary Right,
or (y) other than in the ordinary course of business, agreeing to indemnify
anyone or any entity for or against any interference, infringement,
misappropriation or other conflict with respect to any Parent Proprietary Right.

         (c) Schedule 4.9(d) contains a complete and accurate list of any
proceedings before any patent or trademark authority to which Parent is a party,
a description of the subject matter of each proceeding, and the current status
of each proceeding, including, without limitation, interferences, priority
contests, opposition, and protests. Such list includes any pending applications
for reissue or reexamination of a patent. Parent has the exclusive right to
file, prosecute and maintain any such applications and the patents and
registrations that issue therefrom.

         (d) Parent has taken reasonable measures and precautions to maintain
the secrecy and confidentiality of the Parent Proprietary Rights used or
proposed to be used in the conduct of its business, the value of which to Parent
is contingent upon maintenance of the confidentiality thereof. Except as set
forth in Schedule 4.9(d), each current and former employee and officer of and
consultant and independent contractor to Parent has executed a written
confidentiality agreement and a written assignment of inventions agreement that
assign to Parent all rights to any inventions, improvements, discoveries, or
information relating to the business conducted or to be conducted by Parent. To
the knowledge of Parent, no employee, consultant or contractor of Parent is in
violation of any term of any employment contract, proprietary information
agreement, inventions agreement, non-competition agreement, consulting
agreement, or any other contract or agreement relating to the relationship of
any such employee with Parent or any previous employer.

         4.10 Brokers or Finders. Parent has not dealt with any broker or finder
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner
which will cause Company to

                                     - 32-
<PAGE>   38
incur, directly or indirectly, any liability to such broker or finder for any
brokerage, financial advisory or finders' fees, agent's commissions or similar
charges.

         4.11 Underlying Documents. Copies of any underlying documents listed or
described as having been disclosed to the Company pursuant to this Agreement, if
requested by the Company, have been furnished or made available to the Company.
All such documents furnished or made available to the Company are true and
correct copies, and there are no amendments or modifications thereto, that have
not been disclosed to the Company.

         4.12 Full Disclosure. The representations and warranties and statements
of Parent contained in this Agreement and in the exhibits and in the schedules
hereto do not contain any untrue statements of a material fact, and, when taken
together, do not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make such representations, warranties or statements not
misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made. There are
no facts, including under any contract, which presently or, to the knowledge of
Parent, are reasonably likely in the future to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

capital stock of any class or securities convertible into, or rights, warrants

voting of any of its capital stock.

         (d) Company shall not cause or permit any amendment of its Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws.

         (e) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1 hereof, Company will not take (and Company
will not permit any of its directors, officers, agents, Affiliates or
representatives, including investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys and
accountants (collectively, Company's "Representatives") to take), directly or
indirectly, any of the following actions: (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or
encourage, or furnish information with respect to Company or its subsidiaries in
connection with, any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to any merger,
consolidation or other business combination or acquisition involving Company or
any of its subsidiaries or the acquisition of all or a substantial portion of

nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Company or its board of
directors from (a) engaging in discussions or negotiations with, or providing
information to, any Person in response to an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal by such Person and (b) recommending such unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of Company, if and only to
the extent that (i) the board of directors of Company concludes in good faith
(after consultation with a nationally recognized financial advisory firm) that
such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably capable of being completed taking into
account the financial and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the
Person making the Acquisition Proposal and would, if consummated, result in a
transaction more favorable to Company's stockholders from a financial point of
view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (any such more
favorable Acquisition Proposal being referred to in this Agreement as a
"Superior Proposal"), (ii) the board of directors of Company determines in good
faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that such action is required
for such board to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and
(iii) prior to providing any information or data concerning Company or its
Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by such
Person, Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement
similar to the letter agreement between Parent and Company dated as of September
5, 2000 executed in connection with their consideration of the Merger (the
"Confidentiality Letter").

         Company shall, and shall cause each of Company's Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal.

and shall provide Parent with (i) copies of all written materials relating
thereto and (ii) such other information related thereto as Parent may reasonably
request, unless prohibited by an agreement entered into by Company prior to
September 9, 2000. Thereafter, Company shall keep Parent timely informed of the
status and any material changes in such Acquisition Proposal. Company will not
terminate or amend any agreement, arrangement or understanding to which it is a
party, to the extent that it governs the right of another party or such party's
Affiliates or agents to use or disclose nonpublic information relating to
Company, and Company will use its best efforts to enforce such agreements,
arrangements and understandings.

         (f) Company shall not (a) acquire or agree to acquire by merging or
consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of, or
by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association

representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming

regular and frequent basis with the other, report to the other on operational
matters and promptly advise the other orally and in writing of any change or
event having, or, insofar as can reasonably be foreseen, could be expected to
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, in the case of Company, or a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, in the case of Parent, or which would cause or

any filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. No such information

                                   ARTICLE 6

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         6.1 Access to Information. Each party hereto shall afford to the other
party and shall cause its independent accountants to afford to the other party,
and such party's accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable
access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time to such party's properties, books, contracts, commitments, Tax returns and
records and documents related to such party and its business, properties and
assets, and to the audit work papers and other records of such party's internal
and external accountants. Each party shall provide the other party and its
Representatives with copies of the foregoing upon request by the other party.
During the foregoing period, each party hereto shall furnish promptly to the
other party all other information concerning the business, finances, properties
and personnel of such party as the other party may reasonably request, including
such financial statements (including audited financial statements) as may be
required by the other party to comply with its financial reporting obligations,
including requirements under applicable securities laws.

         6.2 Legal Conditions to the Merger and Related Transactions. Each party
will take all reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with all Legal
Requirements which may be imposed on such party with respect to the Merger and
will promptly cooperate with and furnish information to the other party in
connection with any such requirements imposed upon such other party in
connection with the Merger. Each party will take all reasonable actions to
obtain any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by,
any Governmental Entity, or other third party required to be obtained or made by
such party in connection with the Merger or the taking of any action
contemplated thereby or by this Agreement.

         6.3 Communications; Confidentiality. Each of the parties hereto hereby
agrees to and reaffirms the terms and provisions of the Confidentiality Letter
except to the extent expressly modified hereby. Between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, neither Company, on the one hand, nor Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand, will furnish any communication to its stockholders or to the
public generally (other than communications required pursuant to Section 6.2 or
otherwise required by law) if the subject matter thereof relates to the other
party or to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
approval of the other party as to the content thereof, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, and subject to each party's compliance with applicable
law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may make a


                                     - 38-
<PAGE>   44

public announcement concerning the existence of this Agreement following the
execution thereof subject to Company's prior approval, which shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

         6.4 Update to Disclosures. Without limiting or modifying a party's
representations or warranties or the other party's right to rely thereon and
without limiting the rights and remedies available to such party or its
indemnitees hereunder, each party shall provide the other party with updates to
the disclosures previously provided or made available to the other party, as to
material facts which arise between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date and which, had they occurred and been known prior to the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed in order to make the
representations and warranties contained in Article 3, Article 4 or Article 6
with respect to such party true and correct as of the date of this Agreement.

         6.5 Certain Notifications. At all times from the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time, each party shall promptly notify the other parties in
writing of the occurrence of any event known to such party which will or is
likely to result in the failure to satisfy any of the conditions specified in
Article 7 hereof.

         6.6 Treatment of Plans, Agreements and Options. The Company and Parent
shall cooperate in good faith with respect to the termination, effective as of
the Effective Time, of certain Employee Plans or Benefit Arrangements of the
Company as reasonably requested by Parent. Company shall obtain all necessary
consents or releases from holders of options to purchase Company Common Stock
and take all such other lawful action as may be necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby with respect to such options. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Closing Date, the Board of
Directors of Company shall take all action necessary to terminate or cause to be
terminated each Employee Plan (as defined in Section 3.23(a)) that contains a
cash or deferred arrangement subject to Section 401(k) of the Code and each
Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement that is a defined contribution retirement
plan or employee stock purchase plan. After the Closing Date, Parent may (in its
sole discretion) cause each terminated Employee Plan to be filed with the
Internal Revenue Service for a favorable determination letter and shall take
such other steps as it deems necessary in its sole discretion with respect to
each terminated Employee Plan.

         6.7 Agreements by Affiliated Stockholders. Schedule 6.7 lists the names
and addresses of those persons who are, in Company's reasonable judgment,
"affiliates" of Company within the meaning of Rule 145 of the rules and
regulations promulgated under the Securities Act ("Rule 145") (each such person,
an "Affiliate"). Company shall provide Parent such information and documents as
Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list. Company
shall use its best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, on or
prior to the tenth (10th) day after the date hereof, from each of the Affiliates
of Company identified in the foregoing list, a written Affiliate Agreement in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit E. Parent shall be entitled to place legends
as specified in such Affiliate Agreements on the certificates evidencing any
Parent Common Stock to be received by such Affiliates pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the
transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock, consistent with the terms of such
agreements.

<PAGE>   45
         6.8 Options.

         (a) Assumption. Consistent with the terms of the documents governing
each Company Option, and except for the Company Options set forth on Schedule
6.8(a) hereto (the "Accelerated Options") the terms and conditions of which
shall be amended prior to closing to provide for full acceleration of vesting
and exercisability, the Merger will not terminate or accelerate any Company
Option or any right of exercise, vesting or repurchase relating thereto with
respect to Parent Common Stock acquired upon exercise of such Company Option
assumed by Parent. Holders of Company Options will not be entitled to acquire
shares of the Surviving Corporation after the Merger. Subject to the provisions
of this Section, as of the Effective Time, Parent will assume each Company
Option and all obligations of Company under the Company 1999 Stock Incentive
Plan (the "Option Plan"). Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under this
Agreement (the "Assumed Options"), without any action on the part of the holder
thereof other than the requirement such holder execute and deliver to Parent a
Transfer Restriction Agreement with respect to the shares of common stock
issuable upon exercise of such options, will continue to have, and be subject
to, substantially the same terms and conditions set forth in the Option Plan and
in the other documents governing such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that (i) such Company Option will be exercisable for that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that were purchasable under such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Common Stock
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Option will be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Common Stock Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting
exercise price up to the nearest whole cent.

         (b) Qualification as ISOs. It is the intention of the parties that each
Assumed Option qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of
Section 422 of the Code ("ISOs") to the extent that such Company Option
constituted an ISO immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
the assumption of each Company Option that is an ISO shall be adjusted to the
extent necessary to preserve its treatment as an ISO; provided further that ISO
treatment shall not be available to Accelerated Options to the extent they
exceed the $100,000 calendar year limit on ISOs described in Section 422(d) of
the Code. No assumed Company Option will entitle the holder thereof to any
additional benefits within the meaning of Section 424(a)(2) of the Code that
were not available prior to such assumption.

         (c) Registration. Parent shall file a Registration Statement on Form
S-8 under the Securities Act no later than January 31, 2001, which registration
statement shall cover the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of the Assumed Options that can, in Parent's reasonable judgment, be
registered on a Form S-8, and Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such Parent shares to be registered under the Securities Act and to

         (d) Option Documents. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall issue to each holder of an assumed Company Option a document
evidencing the conversion of such option as provided above.

         (e) Grant of Additional Options. Prior to the Closing, Company shall
issue, at the direction of Parent, nonstatutory options (which are not intended
to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code) to the
persons set forth on, and in such amounts and on the terms and conditions set
forth in Schedule 6.8(e) hereto (such options shall be referred to as
"Additional Company Options") to the extent permitted by state securities laws.
Company shall make all filings and applications required under applicable
federal securities laws and applicable state securities laws in connection with
the issuance of the Additional Company Options. Company and Parent acknowledge
that the Additional Company Options shall not constitute ISO's. Parent shall
account for the issuance of the Additional Company Options in accordance with
GAAP as deferred compensation amortizable over the vesting period of the
Additional Company Options.

         6.9 Employees. Subject to Parent's employee benefit plans, all Company
employees who become employees of Parent or a subsidiary of Parent as of the
Effective Time shall receive the same or reasonably comparable benefits as such
Company employees currently receive (as and to the extent disclosed in writing
to Parent prior to the date hereof) and, to the extent not prohibited by law,
shall receive service credit (other than for benefit accrual under a defined
benefit pension plan) that includes their employment by Company prior to the
Effective Time. Any such employment of such former Company employees shall not
affect the "at will" employment status of any such employee or limit any right
of Parent or its applicable subsidiary to terminate any employee with or without
cause following the Effective Time. Company employees who become employees of
Parent or a subsidiary of Parent as of the Effective Time shall have their
accrued vacation balance transferred to their employment at Parent and shall
thereafter accrue vacation pursuant to Parent's policies.

         6.10 Treatment of Merger as Qualifying Reorganization. Each of Company
and Parent shall (a) treat the Merger as a reorganization under Section 368 of
the Code, (b) report the Merger and all related transactions consistently
therewith in any and all Tax Returns filed by it, (c) take all such actions as
may be reasonably required to cause the Merger to be treated as a qualifying
reorganization, and (d) take no action which could disqualify the Merger from
reorganization status under Section 368 of the Code. Neither Company nor Parent,
as of the date of this Agreement and on the Closing Date, know of any reason (a)
that the transaction may not qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Code, or (b) that the representations customarily required to
obtain a favorable tax opinion that the Merger will qualify the transaction as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code may not be true.
Company shall use reasonable efforts to obtain an opinion from its counsel that
the Merger is a "reorganization" within the meaning of section 368 of the Code.

         6.11 Tax Matters.

         (a) Parent shall cause Company to prepare and file all Tax Returns
required to be filed by or with respect to Company for all periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date which are filed on or after the Closing Date and for
all periods which begin prior to the Closing Date

                                     - 41-
<PAGE>   47
and end after the Closing Date. Without the prior consent of the Holder's
Representative and Parent, the Tax Returns referred to in this paragraph (a)
shall be prepared in a manner consistent in all material respects with such Tax
Returns previously filed in the relevant jurisdiction, unless the relevant
taxing authority has indicated that it will not accept a return filed on such
basis, and shall not reflect any new elections or the adoption of any new
accounting methods or conventions, except to the extent such particular election
or adoption is required to comply with any new law or regulation. Parent shall
timely pay or cause to be timely paid the Taxes attributable to such Tax
periods, subject only to Parent's rights under Section 9.2 of this Agreement to
the extent that the payment of such Taxes represents an item described therein.
The stockholders of Company shall not bear any responsibility for the Taxes of
Company attributable to such periods except as provided in Section 9.2 of this
Agreement.

         (b) Cooperation and Access to Information. Provided that the rights
under this paragraph (b) lapse on the expiration of the Indemnity period or the
exhaustion of the Escrow Fund, the parties to this Agreement shall cooperate as
and to the extent reasonably requested by any other party hereto, in connection
with (i) the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, and (ii) complying with
Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon another party's request)
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

         (c) Retention of Books and Records. Provided that the rights under this
paragraph (c) lapse on the expiration of the Indemnity period or the exhaustion
of the Escrow Fund, the parties to this Agreement agree (i) to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to Company relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the respective taxable periods, and (ii) to give the
other parties to this Agreement reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
requests, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the stockholders of Company, as
the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books
and records.

         (d) Treatment of Indemnity Payment as Purchase Price Adjustment. In the
case of any claim for indemnity under this Agreement based on Taxes determined
to be payable by Company or a successor thereto, the indemnity obligation shall
be considered to be a purchase price adjustment under this Agreement.

         6.12 State Statutes. If any state takeover law shall become applicable
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and its Board of
Directors or Company and its Board of Directors, as the case may be, shall use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals and take such actions as
are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement.

         (b) In the event ninety (90) days shall have elapsed since the filing
of the application for the California Permit and Parent shall not have received

the full cooperation of Company, prepare and file with the SEC a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement"), which will contain a proxy
statement to be sent to the stockholders of Company (the "Proxy Statement").
Company shall provide to Parent and its counsel for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement, in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and its counsel, such
information concerning Company that Parent or its counsel may reasonably request
for purposes of preparing the Registration Statement. Each of Parent and Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC
and to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. Each party will
notify the other parties hereto promptly of the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement and
will supply the other party with copies of all correspondence between such party
or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the
other the hand, with respect to the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement. Whenever any event occurs which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Registration Statement and/or the Proxy Statement, Parent
or Company, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such
occurrence and cooperate in filing such amendment or supplement with the SEC.

         (c) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Company shall

         8.3 Efforts. All the parties hereto shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts (subject to any limitations stated herein) to cause the
Closing Date to be not later than the Termination Date.

                                   ARTICLE 9

                           INDEMNIFICATION AND ESCROW

         9.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of Company and Parent contained in this Agreement or in any
agreement, instrument or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Merger and continue until 5:00 p.m., California time, on the date
which is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the "Expiration Date");
provided, however, that if at any time prior to the Expiration Date, any Parent
Indemnitee delivers to the Holders' Representative or any Company Indemnitee
delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for recovery under Section
9.2 hereof, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the Expiration
Date until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. The waiver of
any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or the
performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect
the right to indemnification set forth in this Article 9 or the right to any
other remedy.

         9.2 Indemnification by Company Stockholders. Subject to the limitations
set forth herein, from and after the Effective Time, the stockholders of
Company, to the extent of the Escrow Fund, will defend and indemnify Parent
(and, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), and its Affiliates,
directors, officers, stockholders, successors and assigns

                                     - 50-
<PAGE>   56
(collectively, the "Parent Indemnitees"), against and hold each of them harmless
from any and all losses, liabilities, Taxes, claims, suits, proceedings,
demands, judgments, damages, expenses and costs, including, without limitation,
reasonable counsel fees, costs and expenses incurred in the investigation,
defense or settlement of any claims covered by this indemnity which any such
Parent Indemnitee may suffer or incur by reason of or against (i) the inaccuracy
or breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of Company
contained in this Agreement or any document, certificate or agreement delivered
pursuant hereto, or (ii) (x) any Transaction Expenses incurred by Company in
excess of one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000), (y) one-half
(1/2) of Informational Expenses incurred by Parent in excess of one hundred
thousand dollars ($100,000), or (z) one-half (1/2) of all Informational Expenses
incurred by Company (together with item (i), the "Indemnifiable Damages"). The
stockholders of Company acknowledge that such Parent Indemnifiable Damages would
relate to unresolved contingencies existing at the Effective Time, which if
resolved at the Effective Time would have led to a reduction in the aggregate
Merger Consideration. The Escrow Fund allocated shall be the sole and exclusive
security and remedy of Parent Indemnitees for the indemnity obligation of the
stockholders of Company. The right to obtain indemnification from the Escrow
Fund pursuant to the indemnification provision of this Section 9.2 and the
Escrow Agreement shall be Parent's exclusive remedy against the stockholders of
Company for any Indemnifiable Damages described in this Section 9.2(a).

         9.3 Escrow Funds.

         (a) As exclusive security and remedy for the indemnity provided for in
Section 9.2(a) and (b) of this Agreement, the Escrow Shares (defined in Section
2.4(f) hereof) shall be registered in the names of the securityholders of
Company but shall be deposited (together with assignments in blank executed by
the securityholders of Company in connection with the surrender of their
Certificates) with an institution selected by Parent with the reasonable consent
of the Holders' Representative as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), such
deposit to constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the
terms set forth herein and in an Escrow Agreement among Parent, the Escrow Agent
and the Holders' Representative (the "Escrow Agreement") substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit I. Subject to the terms of Section 9.3(b) of
this Agreement, upon compliance with the terms hereof and the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to obtain
indemnification from the Escrow Fund for all Parent Indemnifiable Damages
covered by the indemnity provided for in Section 9.2 of this Agreement (it being
understood that each Company Indemnitor's liability under this Agreement shall
be limited to the Escrow Fund). The Escrow Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and Merger Sub may rely upon any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Holders' Representative as being the decision, act, consent
or instruction of each and all of the stockholders of Company. The Escrow Agent,
Parent and Merger Sub are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for
any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Holders' Representative.

         (b) At any time until the earlier of the Expiration Date or the
termination of the Escrow Agreement as provided therein, if any Parent
Indemnitee makes a claim for Indemnifiable Damages and is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof, the Escrow Agent shall, upon
compliance with the procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement, release to
Parent (or other applicable Parent Indemnitee) such amount from the Escrow Fund
which is equal in

                                     - 51-
<PAGE>   57
value to such Indemnifiable Damages. Escrow Shares so released shall be valued
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement. Upon a
distribution by the Escrow Agent to Parent (or other applicable Parent
Indemnitee) pursuant to this Section, the Escrow Fund will be correspondingly
reduced.

         9.4 Indemnification by Parent.

         (a) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent will defend and indemnify each of the stockholders of
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and its Affiliates, directors,
officers, stockholders, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Company
Indemnitees"), against and hold each of them harmless from any and all losses,
liabilities, Taxes, claims, suits, proceedings, demands, judgments, damages,
expenses and costs, including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees,
costs and expenses incurred in the investigation, defense or settlement of any
claims covered by this indemnity which any such Parent Indemnitee may suffer or
incur by reason of (i) the inaccuracy or breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of Parent contained in this Agreement or any document,
certificate or agreement delivered pursuant hereto or (ii) the issuance of the
Additional Company Options in accordance with the terms hereof (items (i) and
(ii) collectively, the "Company Indemnifiable Damages"). Parent shall be
obligated to indemnify the Company Indemnities for Company Indemnifiable Damages
pursuant to this Section 9.4 only if a claim for indemnification is made by the
Holders' Representative on behalf of the Company Indemnitees prior to the
Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate liability of
Parent for all Company Indemnifiable Damages under this Section 9.4 shall not
exceed an amount equal to the product of (i) 334,442 multiplied by (ii) the
greater of the average of the closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock over
the ten day period ending on the day prior to (x) the date hereof or (y) the
date of the Closing.

         9.5 Third Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third
party claim which Parent believes may result in a demand against the Escrow
Fund, Parent shall notify the Holders' Representative of such claim, and the
Holders' Representative, as representative for the securityholders of Company,
shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or
conduct, the defense of such claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole
discretion to conduct the defense of and settle any such claim; provided,
however, that except with the consent of the Holders' Representative, no
settlement of any such claim with third party claimants shall alone be
determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter or whether such
amounts shall be payable from the Escrow Fund. In the event that the Holders'
Representative has consented to any such settlement, the securityholders of
Company shall have no power or authority to object under any provision of this
Article 9 to the amount of any claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund with
respect to such settlement.

         9.6 Holders' Representative.

         (a) The adoption and approval of this Agreement by the Company's
stockholders shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement and of all of the
arrangements relating thereto, including without limitation the placement of the
Escrow Shares in escrow, and the appointment of the Stephen Fredrick as Holders'
Representative to act for and on behalf of all stockholders of the Company, as
the attorney-in-fact and agent of all such persons, to give and receive notices


                                     - 52-
<PAGE>   58
and communications, to authorize delivery of any shares of Parent Common Stock
and cash, if any, from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent
Indemnitees, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate and enter into
settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders and decrees with respect
to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment
of such representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. A decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Holders' Representative shall constitute a
decision of all the stockholders of Company and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each of the stockholders of Company. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Holders' Representative shall have full power
and authority, on behalf of all the Company Stockholders and their successors,
to interpret all the terms and provisions of this Agreement, to dispute or fail
to dispute any Claim of Indemnifiable Damages against the Escrow Shares made by
a Parent Indemnitee, to assert Claims of Indemnifiable Damages against any the
Escrow Fund, to negotiate and compromise any dispute which may arise under this
Agreement, to sign any releases or other documents with respect to any such
dispute, and to authorize delivery of Escrow Shares pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement or any other payments to be made with respect thereto.

         (b) The Holders' Representative, or any successor hereafter appointed,
may resign and shall be discharged of his duties hereunder upon the appointment
of a successor Holders' Representative as hereinafter provided. In case of such
resignation, or in the event of the death or inability to act of the
Representative, a successor shall be named from among the Stockholders by a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors of who served on such board
prior to the Merger. Each such successor Holders' Representative shall have all
the power, authority, rights and privileges hereby conferred upon the original
Holders' Representative, and the term "Holders' Representative" as used herein
shall be deemed to include such successor Holders' Representative.

         (c) In performing any of its duties under this Agreement, or upon the
claimed failure to perform his duties hereunder, the Holders' Representative
shall not be liable to the Company stockholders or anyone else for any
Indemnifiable Damages, losses or expenses which they may incur as a result of
any act, or failure to act under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;
provided, however, that the Representative shall be liable for Indemnifiable
Damages arising out of actions or omissions that both (i) were taken or omitted
not in good faith and (ii) constituted willful default or gross negligence under
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Accordingly, the Representative shall
not incur any such Liability with respect to (i) any action taken or omitted to
be taken in good faith upon advice of his counsel given with respect to any
questions relating to the duties and responsibilities of the Holders'
Representative hereunder; or (ii) any action taken or omitted to be taken in
reliance upon any document, including any written notice or instructions
provided for in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, not only as to its due
execution and to the validity and effectiveness of its provisions, but also as
to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which the
Holders' Representative shall in good faith believe to be genuine, to have been
signed or presented by the purported proper person or persons and to conform
with the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The limitation
of liability provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the resignation of the Holders' Representative. The stockholders
of Company shall severally indemnify the Holders' Representative and hold him
harmless against any loss, liability or expense (including any expenses of legal
counsel retained by the Holders' Representative) incurred without willful
default, gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Holders'

                                     - 53-

Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of his duties hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE 10

                               PAYMENT OF EXPENSES

10.1 Payment of Expenses. Except as provided in Sections 2.3, 9, 11.1 or 11.2,
Parent and Company shall each pay its own fees and expenses incurred incident to
the Fairness Hearing, the Information Statement and the Registration Statement
(collectively, the "Informational Expenses"), and all fees and expenses, other
than Informational Expenses, incurred incident to the preparation and carrying
out of the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
performance of the transactions herein contemplated, including, without
limitation, legal, accounting, travel fees and expenses ("Transactional
Expenses").

                                   ARTICLE 11

                        TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

         11.1 Termination.

         (a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective
Time, whether before or after Required Stockholder Vote has been obtained, by
mutual written consent of the parties hereto.

         (b) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective
Time by either Company or Parent if (i) the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before January 30, 2001 (the "Termination Date"), whether before
or after the Required Stockholder Vote has been obtained, or, if the Merger
shall not have occurred by such date because of the failure of the condition set
forth in Section 7.1(f), March 31, 2001, or (ii) any order, decree or injunction
of a federal or state court preventing or restraining consummation of the Merger
shall have become final and non-appealable, whether before or after the Required
Stockholder Vote has been obtained, or (iii) there shall be any action taken, or
any Legal Requirement enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the
Merger, by any Governmental Entity which would make consummation of the Merger
illegal or otherwise render Parent or Company unable to consummate the Merger;
or (iv) the Required Stockholder Vote shall not have been obtained pursuant to
Section 6.13 hereof; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement shall
not be available to any party hereto that has breached in any material respect
its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately
contributed to the failure of the Merger to be consummated (including without
limitation the failure of the Required Stockholder Vote to have been obtained);
or

         (c) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective
Time by Parent if there has been a material breach by Company of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
(other than Section 5.1(e)) and, if such breach is curable through the exercise
of commercially reasonable efforts, such breach has not been cured within

                                     - 54-
<PAGE>   60
ten (10) business days after receipt by Company of written notice of such
breach; provided, however, that such material breach has resulted in or is
reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

         (d) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective
Time by Company if there has been a material breach by Parent of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and,
if such breach is curable through the exercise of commercially reasonable
efforts, such breach has not been cured within ten (10) business days after
receipt by Company of written notice of such breach; provided, however, that
such material breach has resulted in or is reasonably likely to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect; or

         (e) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective
Time by Parent if (i) the board of directors of Company shall have withdrawn or
modified in a manner adverse to Parent its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement (or any of its terms), or the transactions contemplated hereby (or
disclosed an intention to do so) or failed to reconfirm such recommendation
within five (5) business days after a written request by Parent to do so; or
(ii) Section 5.1(e) shall have been breached by Company in any material respect
and Company shall have failed to promptly terminate the activity giving rise to
such breach; or (iii) if Company shall take any of the actions that would be
proscribed by Section 5.1(e) but for the exception therein allowing certain
actions to be taken pursuant to clause (a) and (b); or

         (f) If (i) Company is not in material breach of any of the terms of
this Agreement, (ii) the board of directors of Company approves entering into a
binding written agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior
Proposal and Company notifies Parent in writing that Company wishes to enter
into such agreement, (iii) Parent does not make, within ten business days of
receipt of Company's written notification of its desire to enter into a binding
agreement for a Superior Proposal, an offer that the board of directors of
Company believes, in good faith after consultation with a nationally recognized
financial advisory firm, is at least as favorable, from a financial point of
view, to the stockholders of Company as the Superior Proposal and (iv) Company
prior to such termination pays to Parent in immediately available funds any fees
required to be paid pursuant to Section 11.2. Company agrees to notify Parent
promptly if its wish to enter into a written agreement referred to in its
notification shall change at any time after giving such notification.

         11.2 Effect of Termination.

         (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by Company or Parent
as provided in Section 11.1, this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger shall
forthwith become void, other than the obligations of Company pursuant to Section
6.14(c), which shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and there shall
be no liability or obligation on the part of the parties hereto or their
respective officers or directors; provided, however, that no such termination
will relieve any party from liability resulting from (i) the willful breach by a
party hereto of any of its representations or warranties, or (ii) the willful
breach by a party hereto of its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, or (iii) in the case of Company, any obligation of Company to pay the
amounts payable pursuant to Section 11.2(b).

                                     - 55-
<PAGE>   61
         (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to Section 11.1(b)(iv), Section 11.1(c) because of an intentional or willful
breach of a covenant by Company, Section 11.1(e)(i), (ii) or (iii), or Section
11.1(f), then Company shall pay promptly (but in no event later than two (2)
business days after the date of such termination) a termination payment
("Termination Payment") equal to five percent (5%) of an amount equal to
4,950,000 multiplied by the greater of the average closing sale prices of Parent
Common Stock over the ten day period ending on the day prior to (x) the date
hereof and (y) the date of termination of this Agreement, which amount shall be
exclusive of any expenses payable pursuant to Article 10 (Payment of Expenses)
and shall be payable by wire transfer of same-day U.S. funds. Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 11.2(b) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this
Section 11.2(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit
which results in a judgment against Company for the payment set forth in this
Section 11.2(b), Company shall pay to Parent all of Parent's costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest
on the amount due from each date for payment until the date of such payment at
the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made plus two percent (2%). Parent and Company agree and acknowledge that
the Termination Payment shall be deemed liquidated damages in respect of any
breach or obligation hereunder. To the extent that Parent requests that Company
pay the Termination Payment and such payment is paid in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, Parent shall not be entitled to exercise the Option
under the Stockholders' Agreement. In the event Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(d) because of an intentional or willful
breach of a covenant by Parent, Company and Parent agree that Company's damages
would be an amount equal to the Termination Payment and such amount shall be
deemed liquidated damages in respect of any breach or obligation hereunder.

         11.3 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of all the parties hereto. After approval
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the stockholders
of Company, no amendment hereto shall be made which by law requires the further
approval of stockholders without obtaining such further approval.

         11.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
Parent, Merger Sub or Company, by such corporate action as shall be appropriate,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to Parent, Merger Sub or
Company contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit
thereof contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

         12.8 Severability. If for any reason whatsoever, any one or more of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be held or deemed to be inoperative,
unenforceable or invalid as applied to any particular case or in all cases, such
circumstances shall not have the effect of rendering such provision invalid in
any other case or of rendering any of the other provisions of this Agreement
inoperative, unenforceable or invalid.

         12.9 Remedies Cumulative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any
party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to herein will operate as a waiver of such right, power or
privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or
privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or
privilege.

         12.10 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge
that, in the event of a breach of any provision of this Agreement, the aggrieved
party may be without an adequate remedy at law. The parties therefore agree that
in the event of a breach of any provision of this Agreement the aggrieved party
may elect to institute and prosecute proceedings in any court of competent
jurisdiction to obtain specific performance or to enjoin the continuing breach
of such provision, as well as to obtain damages for breach of this Agreement and
to obtain reasonable attorneys' fees. By seeking or obtaining any such relief,
the aggrieved party will not be precluded from seeking or obtaining any other
relief to which it may be entitled.

         12.11 Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to
do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable consistent with
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible, to obtain
all necessary approvals of any Governmental Entity in a manner that does not
materially alter the underlying obligations of the parties and, in any event, is
on terms equally favorable to Company, and to effect any required filings,
registrations and notifications. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall do and perform or cause to be done and
performed all

                                     - 59-

such further actions and things and shall execute and deliver all such other
agreements, certificates, instruments or documents as any other party hereby may
reasonably request in order to carry out the intent and purposes of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and each
party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions
set forth in Article 7 to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to agree to any divestiture by Parent or
Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates of shares of
capital stock or of any business, assets or property of Parent or Company or
their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to the imposition of any
material limitation on the ability of any of Parent or Company or their
respective subsidiaries and Affiliates to conduct their businesses or to own or
exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.
