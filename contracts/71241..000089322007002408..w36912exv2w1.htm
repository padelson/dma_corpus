Merger Sub and the Company) of letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the certificates which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any of
such Shares in exchange for payment therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such
certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance

letters of transmittal, pay to the persons entitled thereto a check in the amount to which such
persons are entitled, after giving effect to any required tax withholdings. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on the amount payable upon the surrender of any such certificate. If payment
is to be made to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, it shall
be a condition of such payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. One hundred and eighty days following the Effective
Time, the Parent shall be entitled to cause the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent which have not been
disbursed to holders of certificates formerly representing Shares outstanding on the Effective
Time, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Parent only as general creditors
thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their certificates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any
holder of certificates formerly representing Shares for any amount paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, and, if reasonably requested by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by the holder of
a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares represented by
such Certificate pursuant to this ARTICLE 2.

Nonqualified Stock Option Plan for Officers and Key Employees and any similar plan or arrangement

exercisable or vested, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any
holder of any Option, become fully exercisable and vested. At the Effective Time (A)&nbsp;each Option
which is then outstanding shall be canceled and (B)&nbsp;in consideration of such cancellation, each
Option shall be converted into the right to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (x)&nbsp;the
excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price thereof, if any, and (y)&nbsp;the number of
shares of Common Stock subject thereto (such payment to be net of taxes required by Law to be

share exercise price, as in effect at the Effective Time, equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration. In addition, all shares reserved for issuance under the Option Plans shall be
canceled.<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"> </SUP> The cancellation of an Option as provided in this Section&nbsp;2.4 shall be deemed
a release of any and all rights the holder thereof had or may have in respect of such Option.
Within five (5)&nbsp;business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall pay the aggregate amount due
to holders of Options pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.4 to an account or accounts designated by the
Company by wire transfer of immediately available United States funds. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any and all
actions necessary to effectuate this Section&nbsp;2.4.

withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<B>Code</B>&#148;), or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.6 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution</B>. In the event that the Company changes the number of shares of Common Stock, or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to
the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted
to reflect
such change; <U>provided</U> that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take
any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Each Plan that is subject to section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or section 412 of the Code is
hereinafter referred to as a &#147;<B>Title IV Plan</B>.&#148;

other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (which premiums have
been paid when due). Insofar as the representation made in this section 3.12(c) applies to
