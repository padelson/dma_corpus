 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement"), dated as of July 10, 2007, is made by and among Eppendorf Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Edison Merger Corp., a New Jersey corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and New Brunswick Scientific Co., Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the "Company"). 

  

 _RECITALS:_  

   

 WHEREAS, this Agreement contemplates a merger of Merger Sub into the Company (the "Merger") and in such merger, the shareholders of the Company will receive cash in exchange for their common stock, par value $0.0625 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"); 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved and adopted this Agreement and deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders to consummate the business combination provided for herein, upon the terms and subject to the conditions provided for herein and in accordance with the provisions of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act ("NJBCA"); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined to recommend to the shareholders of the Company the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), upon the terms and subject to the conditions provided for herein;

 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company pursuant to Article 10 of the NJBCA and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of New Jersey, and the separate corporate existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers, purposes and franchises, both public and private, shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 14A:10-6 of the 

   ##### 

  

    

NJBCA. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall possess all the rights, privileges, powers, immunities,
purposes, and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, and all of the
claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of
the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place (a) at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, LLP, New York, New York at 10:00 a.m. on the third business day after the last to be fulfilled or waived of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 6(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement or (b) at such other place and time and/or on such other date as the Company and the Parent may agree (the actual date on which the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date"). 

  

 1.3 Effective Time. Contemporaneously with the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub will cause a Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with respect to the Merger to be signed, acknowledged and delivered for filing with the Secretary of the State of New Jersey as provided in Section 14A:10-4.1 of the NJBCA. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of New Jersey or such other time as shall be agreed upon by the parties and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time"). 

  

 1.4 The Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in the form of the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Surviving Charter"), until duly amended as provided in the Surviving Charter or by applicable Law, subject to Section 5.8, except that, as of the Effective Time, Article I of such certificate of incorporation shall be amended to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is New Brunswick Scientific Co., Inc.". 

  

 1.5 The By-Laws. The by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in the form of the by-laws of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time (the "Surviving By-Laws"), until duly amended as provided in the Surviving By-Laws or by applicable Law, subject to Section 5.8. 

  

 1.6 Directors of Surviving Corporation. The directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Charter and the Surviving By-Laws. 

  

 1.7 Officers of Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Charter and the Surviving By-Laws. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE 2 
 CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF SHARES 
 IN THE MERGER 

   

 2.1 Conversion or Cancellation of Shares. The manner of converting, retaining or canceling shares of the Company and Merger Sub in the Merger shall be as follows: 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.1(b), each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Merger Sub, collectively, the "Shares"), together with the rights issued pursuant to the Rights Plan, shall be cancelled and shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive, without interest, an amount in cash equal to $11.50 (the "Merger Consideration") upon surrender of the certificate (or evidence of such shares in book-entry form) as provided in Section 2.2. All such Shares, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of such Shares in book-entry form) representing any such Shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such Shares upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time and owned by Merger Sub, and each Share issued and held in the Companys treasury at the Effective Time, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub or the holders of such shares, be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 2.2 Payment for Shares. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to the paying agent appointed by the Parent that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent") amounts sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof to holders of Shares. At the Effective Time, the Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to promptly, and in any event not later than three business days following the Effective Time, mail to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of issued and outstanding Shares a form (mutually agreed to by Merger Sub and the Company) of letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any of such Shares in exchange for payment therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to promptly, and in any event not later than three business days following receipt 

   ##### 

  

    

of properly tendered certificates and letters of transmittal, pay to the
persons entitled thereto a check in the amount to which such persons are
entitled, after giving effect to any required tax withholdings. No interest
will be paid or will accrue on the amount payable upon the surrender of any
such certificate. If payment is to be made to a person other than the
registered holder of the certificate surrendered, it shall be a condition of
such payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable. One hundred and eighty days following
the Effective Time, the Parent shall be entitled to cause the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) made available to the Paying Agent which have not been disbursed to
holders of certificates formerly representing Shares outstanding on the
Effective Time, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the
Parent only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any
party hereto shall be liable to any holder of certificates formerly
representing Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 2.3 Transfer of Shares After the Effective Time. No transfer of Shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation at or after the Effective Time. 

  

 (a) After the Effective Time, Certificates presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this ARTICLE 2. 

  

 (b) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if reasonably requested by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this ARTICLE 2. 

  

 2.4 Treatment of Stock Options. (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Common Stock (an "Option") granted under each of the Companys 1998 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan for Ten Percent Shareholder-Directors; 1999 Stock Option Plan for Nonemployee Directors; and 2001 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan for Officers and Key Employees and any similar plan or arrangement providing for the issuance of options (collectively, the "Option Plans"), whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any Option, become fully exercisable and vested. At the Effective Time (A) each Option which is then outstanding shall be canceled and (B) in consideration of such cancellation, each Option shall be converted into the right to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (x) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price thereof, if any, and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock subject thereto (such payment to be net of taxes required by Law to be withheld with 

   ##### 

  

    

respect thereto). No payment shall be made with respect to any Option having a
per share exercise price, as in effect at the Effective Time, equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration. In addition, all shares reserved for
issuance under the Option Plans shall be canceled. The cancellation of an
Option as provided in this Section 2.4 shall be deemed a release of any and
all rights the holder thereof had or may have in respect of such
Option. Within five (5) business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
pay the aggregate amount due to holders of Options pursuant to this Section
2.4 to an account or accounts designated by the Company by wire transfer of
immediately available United States funds. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
any and all actions necessary to effectuate this Section 2.4. 

  

 2.5 Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

  

 2.6 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the event that the Company changes the number of shares of Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE 3 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

   

 The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as set forth in the relevant section of the Companys Disclosure Letter delivered to Merger Sub by the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"): 

  

 3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. 

  

 (a) Each of the Company and each subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the "Company Subsidiaries") is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be, and has the requisite power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power, authority and governmental approvals, individually or in the aggregate, have not resulted, and could not reasonably be expected to result, in costs or liabilities to the Company 

   ##### 

  

    

and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than immaterial costs
and liabilities. Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly
qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not resulted, and could not reasonably be expected to result,
in costs or liabilities to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, other than immaterial costs and liabilities. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Material Adverse Effect on the Company" means any change in or
effect on the business, assets, liabilities, properties, prospects,
results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary that, individually or in the aggregate, (x) is or
could reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that no
change, effect, event or occurrence to the extent arising or resulting from
any of the following, either alone or in combination, shall constitute or be
taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company: (i) general economic or
market conditions or general changes or developments in the research and
scientific instrument industry or affecting participants in the
pharmaceutical industry, (ii) acts of war or terrorism or natural disasters,

shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting, and subject to the

the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change only after the Board of Directors of the Company (x) provides written
notice to Parent (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") advising Parent that the
Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof has received a
Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal, identifying the Person or group making such Superior
Proposal and representing that such Superior Proposal was not initiated,
solicited, encouraged or facilitated by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives, and (y) determines in
good faith after receiving the advice of its independent legal and financial
advisors that (1) any transaction proposed by Parent is not at least as
favorable to the Company and its shareholders from a financial point of view
(taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the proposal and identity of the offeror and the
financial capacity of the offeror to consummate the transaction) as the
Superior Proposal and (2) it is required to make such Adverse Recommendation
Change in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under Laws applicable to
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that (I) neither the Board of Directors
of the Company nor any committee thereof may make an Adverse Recommendation

Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new notice
period under this Section 5.7(b);  _provided_ , _however_ , that any such new
notice period given after the third (3rd) business day of such five-day
period need only be for an additional three (3) business days, and (III) the
Company shall not be entitled to enter into any agreement, including any
letter of intent, or agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding or
similar arrangement, with respect to a Superior Proposal unless and until
this Agreement is terminated by its terms pursuant to Section 7.1 and the
Company has paid all amounts due to Parent pursuant to Section 7.5; 
_provided_ , _further_ , that during such five (5) or three (3) business day
periods, as applicable, referenced in (I) and (II) above, the Company shall
cooperate and negotiate with Parent to enable Parent to make such a revised
proposal. Without limiting any other rights of Parent and Merger Sub under
this Agreement, any Adverse Recommendation Change or any termination of

contemplated hereby and thereby, which approvals and actions are
irrevocable.

Parent, including initiating and prosecuting litigation seeking appropriate
equitable relief (where available) and, to the extent applicable, damages. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.7 shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board, after consultation with independent counsel and based as to legal matters on the written advice of the Companys independent legal counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as contemplated by clause (b) of this Section 5.7, neither the Company nor the Board nor any committee thereof shall make an Adverse Recommendation Change.

   ##### 

  

 

alternative proposal made by Parent pursuant to Section 5.7(b)) and for which
financing, to the extent required, is then fully committed and as to which

policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. 

  

 (c) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.
