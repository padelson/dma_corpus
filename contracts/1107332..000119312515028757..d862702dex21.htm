or the Sellers thereunder. If with respect to any Acquired Asset such consent
is not obtained or such assignment is not attainable pursuant to Sections
105, 363 or 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, then such Acquired Asset shall not be
transferred hereunder and the Closing shall proceed with respect to the
remaining Acquired Assets without any reduction in the 

 



7  Purchase Price. In the case of Contracts included in the Acquired Assets (i)
that cannot be transferred or assigned effectively without the consent of
third parties, which consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing
(after giving effect to the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code), the Sellers
shall, at the Purchaser sole expense and subject to any approval of the
Bankruptcy Court that may be required, reasonably cooperate with the
Purchaser in endeavoring to obtain such consent and, if any such consent is
not obtained, the Sellers shall, following the Closing, at the Purchaser sole
expense and subject to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that may
be required, cooperate with the Purchaser in all reasonable respects to
provide to the Purchaser the benefits thereof in some other manner, or (ii)
that are otherwise not transferable or assignable (after giving effect to the
Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code), the Sellers shall, following the
Closing, at the Purchaser sole expense and subject to any approval of the
Bankruptcy Court that may be required, reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser
to provide to the Purchaser the benefits thereof in some other manner;
provided, that nothing in this _Section 1.5_ shall (x) require any Seller or
any Affiliate thereof to make any expenditure or incur any obligation on its
own or on behalf of the Purchaser (unless funds in the full amount thereof
are advanced to the Sellers in cash) or (y) prohibit or delay any Seller or
any Affiliate thereof from ceasing operations or winding up its affairs
following the Closing.

 

(b) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Tax Laws (and to the extent
consistent with the relevant arrangement agreed to by the Sellers and the
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_), the Sellers and the Purchaser agree
to treat and report, and to cause their respective Affiliates to treat and
report, on their Tax Returns, the Acquired Assets that are subject to
the provisions of this _Section 1.5_ (the " _Non-Transferred Assets_ ") as
assets owned by the Purchaser or its designated Affiliates. Each Seller and
Purchaser agrees to notify the other parties promptly in writing if
it determines that such treatment (to the extent consistent with the relevant
arrangement agreed to by the Sellers and the Purchaser pursuant to _Section
1.5(a)_) is not permitted under applicable Tax Laws. Where such treatment is
not permitted under applicable Tax Laws, and subject to the terms of any
relevant arrangement agreed to by the Sellers and the Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 1.5(a)_, the amount of the liability for Taxes imposed on the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates with respect to any Non-Transferred Asset
for any Post-Closing Period for which the Purchaser and its designated
Affiliates are responsible shall be calculated on a "with and without" basis.

 

Section 1.6 _Purchase Price; Deposit Funds_.

 

(a) In consideration for the Acquired Assets, the Purchaser shall, in addition
to the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, pay to the Sellers at the
Closing an amount equal to $296,000,000 (the " _Purchase Price_ "). The
Purchaser shall pay (or shall cause one of its Affiliates to pay) the Purchase
Price at the Closing to the Parent on behalf of the Sellers, in cash, net of
any Deposit Funds paid to the Parent at the Closing pursuant to _Section
1.6(b)(ii)_. If the Closing shall occur, at the Closing, the Purchaser and the
Parent shall provide joint written instructions, executed by their
respective authorized representatives under the Escrow Agreement, to the
Escrow Agent that instruct the Escrow Agent to release the Deposit Funds to
the Parent on the Closing Date. The Deposit Funds received by the Parent shall
be applied at the Closing toward the payment of the Purchase Price.

 



8 (b) On the Effective Date, the Purchaser shall deposit with Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, in its capacity as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_
"), the sum of $29,600,000 (the " _Deposit Funds_ "), to be released by the
Escrow Agent and delivered to either the Purchaser or to the Parent on behalf
of the Sellers in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement entered into by and among the Purchaser, the Parent and the
Escrow Agent concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ ") as follows:

(i) if the Closing shall occur, the Deposit Funds shall be applied towards the
Purchase Price payable by the Purchaser to the Sellers pursuant to _Section
1.6(a)_ hereof;

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Parent (A) pursuant to _Section
7.1(e)_ or (B) pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ in any circumstance where the
Purchaser is not entitled to terminate pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ because
the failure of the Closing to occur results from the failure of the Purchaser
to materially perform any of its obligations under this Agreement required to
be performed by it at or prior to the Closing, the Deposit Funds shall be
delivered to the Parent; or

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated other than in a manner provided by
_Section 1.6(b)(ii)_, the Deposit Funds shall be delivered to the Purchaser.

Section 1.7 _Allocation of Purchase Price for Tax Purposes_. The Sellers
and the Purchaser shall cooperate to prepare, within sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date, a statement allocating the sum of the Purchase
Price and the Assumed Liabilities (and any liabilities treated as assumed by
the Purchaser or its Affiliates for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) among
the Acquired Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder. If there is any adjustment to the
Purchase Price, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, the Sellers
and the Purchaser agree to make appropriate adjustments to such statement. The
Sellers and the Purchaser shall be bound for tax purposes by such allocation
(and if necessary, any revised allocation), and, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, shall file, or cause to be filed, all applicable Tax Returns
in a manner that is substantially consistent with such allocation. If such
allocation is disputed by any taxing authority, the party hereto
receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto concerning the existence of such dispute and the parties hereto shall
consult with each other with respect to all issues related to the allocation
in connection with such dispute. 

Section 1.8 _No Withholding_. Any amount paid to a Seller shall be made free
and clear of any withholding or other Tax.

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Sellers to the

shall be deemed to be disclosed both under such section and any other section
of this Agreement to which it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure
relates) (the " _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Sellers represent and

existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the

 



11  requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
failure to be so existing and in good standing or to have such power and
authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect. Each Seller and each Non-Debtor Sub is duly qualified or licensed to
do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified,
licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect. The Sellers have made available to the
Purchaser a complete and correct copy of the organizational documents of each
Seller and each Non-Debtor Sub, as in effect on the Effective Date.

 

Section 3.2 _Capitalization of Non-Debtor Subs_. The authorized, issued and

3.2_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. All such equity interests are owned
beneficially and of record by either the Parent or the Transferred Sub, as set
forth on _Section 3.2_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. There are no
existing (a) options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or other rights,
agreements or commitments of any character obligating any Seller or any Non-
Debtor Sub to issue, transfer or sell any equity interests in any Non-Debtor
Sub or securities convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for any of the
foregoing, (b) contractual obligations of any Seller or any Non-Debtor Sub to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any equity interests in any Non-
Debtor Sub or (c) voting trusts or similar agreements to which any Seller or
any Non-Debtor Sub is a party with respect to the voting of equity interests
in any Non-Debtor Sub.

 

Section 3.3 _Authority of the Sellers_. Each Seller has all requisite entity
power and authority to execute, deliver and, subject to the entry and

Documents by each Seller and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized and approved by all
requisite entity action of such Seller. Subject to the entry and effectiveness
of the Sale Order, this Agreement and each such Ancillary Document have been,
duly and validly executed and delivered by each Seller and (assuming this
Agreement and each such Ancillary Document constitute, a valid and binding
obligation of the Purchaser) constitute a valid and binding obligation of
each Seller enforceable against each such Seller in accordance with their
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium and other Laws affecting creditors rights generally from time

authorizations, declarations, filings and registrations referred to in
_Sections 3.4_ and _4.3_ have been made or obtained and remain in full force
and effect and the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ have been satisfied,

or other organizational documents of any Seller or any Non-Debtor Sub, (b)
with or without notice or lapse of time or both, result in any breach or

and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where the failure to be so existing and in good standing or to
have such power and authority would not, individually or in the aggregate,
materially impair or materially delay the Purchasers ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement. The Purchaser is duly qualified or licensed
to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified, licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, materially impair or materially delay the Purchasers ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 4.2 _Authority of the Purchaser_. The Purchaser has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform their
obligations under this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents to which
it is a party. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
such Ancillary Documents by the Purchaser and the consummation by the
Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action of the Purchaser. This Agreement
and each such Ancillary Document has been, or at or prior to Closing (as the
case may be) will be, duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Purchaser and (assuming this Agreement and each such Ancillary Document
constitute a valid and binding obligation of the Sellers) constitute, or at or

Section 4.3 _Consents and Approvals_. No consent, approval or authorization
of, or declaration, filing or registration with, any Governmental Entity is
required to be made or obtained by the Purchaser or its Affiliates in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, except (a) for consents, approvals,

this Agreement or (b) pursuant to the HSR Act.

Section 4.4 _No Violations_. Assuming that the consents, approvals,
authorizations, declarations, filings and registrations referred to in
_Sections 3.4_ and _4.3_ have been made or obtained and remain in full force
and effect and the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ have been
satisfied, neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or
the Ancillary Documents by the Purchaser nor the consummation by the Purchaser
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (a) conflict with or
result in any breach of any provisions of the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or other organizational documents of the

 



22  Purchaser, (b) with or without notice or lapse of time or both, result in
any breach or violation of or constitute a default or give rise to any right

assets are bound, (c) result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance
other than Permitted Encumbrances on any properties or assets of the
Purchaser or (d) violate any Order or Law applicable to the Purchaser or its
properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (b), (c) and (d), for

the Purchasers ability to perform their obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 4.5 _Brokers_. Except for Jerry Lundquist, no Person is entitled to
any brokerage, financial advisory, finders or similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of the Purchaser or their Affiliates.

 

Section 4.6 _Financing; Solvency_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Date, the Purchaser has, and on the Closing Date, the
Purchaser will have, sufficient funds available to deliver the Purchase Price

such debts as they mature or become due, (ii) the then present fair saleable

valuation will exceed their debts (including the probable amount of all

defraud either present or future creditors of the Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries.

Section 5.4 _Additional Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be

consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable, including that in the case of Contracts included
in the Acquired Assets that cannot be transferred or assigned effectively
without the consent of third parties (after giving effect to the Sale Order
and the Bankruptcy Code), the Sellers shall, at the Purchaser sole expense
and subject to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that may be required,
reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser in endeavoring to obtain such consent
(provided, that nothing in this Section 5.4 shall require any Seller or any
Affiliate thereof to make any expenditure or incur any obligation on its own

Section 5.7 _Bankruptcy Court Approval_.

 

(a) The Sellers acknowledge and agree that the Purchaser has expended

of Sellers. In consideration therefor, the Sellers shall, as promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, but in no event later than
four (4) hours after the time that this Agreement is executed by both the
Sellers and the Purchaser, file with and seek the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court of the Stalking Horse Motion, including the Break-Up Fee and Expense
Reimbursement Amount, and the entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Stalking
Horse Order approving the payment of the Break-Up Fee and the Expense

and 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Sellers shall use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Stalking Horse
Order no later than February 6, 2015 (which may be extended to no later than
February 9, 2015, at the election of the Sellers upon written notice to the
Purchaser, solely in the event of any closure of the Bankruptcy Court, natural
disaster, act of God or other similar force majeure type event, in each case,
that precludes the Sellers from obtaining entry by the Bankruptcy Court of
the Stalking Horse Order on February 6, 2015). The Sellers and the Purchaser
agree that the Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement Amount were together a
material inducement to the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall be payable as
specified herein.

(b) The Sellers and the Purchaser acknowledge that this Agreement and the
sale of the Acquired Assets are subject to Bankruptcy Court approval. The
Sellers and the Purchaser acknowledge that (i) to obtain such approval, the
Sellers must demonstrate that they have taken reasonable steps to obtain the
highest or otherwise best offer possible for the Acquired Assets, including
giving notice of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to creditors
and certain other interested parties as ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, and,
if necessary, conducting an auction in respect of the Acquired Assets (the "

performance under the Assigned Contracts and Assumed Leases included in the
Acquired Assets.

 



28 (c) The Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Bankruptcy Court to enter the Sale Order. The Sellers shall use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Sale
Order no later than twenty-eight (28) days after the date hereof.

 

(d) The Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser in connection with the Sale
Order, the Bidding Procedures Order, the Stalking Horse Order, and the
bankruptcy proceedings in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall
include, but not be limited to, consulting with the Purchaser at the
Purchasers reasonable request concerning the status of such proceedings. The
Sellers further covenant and agree that the terms of any plan they submit to
the Bankruptcy Court for confirmation shall not conflict with, supersede,
abrogate, nullify or restrict the terms of this Agreement, or in any way
prevent or interfere with the consummation or performance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, any transaction
contemplated by or approved pursuant to the Sale Order, the Bidding Procedures
Order or the Stalking Horse Order.

 

(e) In the event an appeal is taken or a stay pending appeal is requested,
from either the Stalking Horse Order or the Sale Order, the Sellers shall
promptly notify the Purchaser of such appeal or stay request and shall
promptly provide to the Purchaser a copy of the related notice of appeal or
order of stay. The Sellers shall also provide the Purchaser with written
notice of any motion or application filed in connection with any appeal from
either of such orders.

(f) From and after the Effective Date, and to the extent the Purchaser is the
Successful Bidder at the Auction, the Sellers shall not take any action that
is intended to result in, or fail to take any action the intent of which
failure to act would result in, the reversal, voiding, modification or staying
of the Bidding Procedures Order, the Stalking Horse Order or the Sale Order
or that would be inconsistent with this Agreement.

(g) If an Auction is conducted and the Purchaser is not the Successful Bidder
at the conclusion of such Auction, the Purchaser shall be required to serve as
the Back-Up Bidder if the Purchaser is the next highest or otherwise next best
bidder at the Auction (such party that is the next highest or otherwise next
best bidder at the Auction, the " _Back-Up Bidder_ ") and, if the Purchaser is
the Back-Up Bidder, the Purchaser shall be required to keep its bid to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement (as the same may be improved upon by
the Purchaser in the Auction) open and irrevocable until the earlier of (i)

following the Effective Date, (ii) 60 days following the entry of the Sale
Order as to the Successful Bidder or (iii) the closing of the transaction with
the Successful Bidder. The Purchaser agrees that if the Purchaser is the
Back-Up Bidder, any order approving a sale of some or all of the Acquired
Assets to the Successful Bidder shall, subject to approval by the Bankruptcy
Court, provide that if the Successful Bidder fails to consummate the sale
transaction, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have the new prevailing bid, and
the Sellers shall be required (provided that nothing herein shall require the
Sellers or any directors or officers of the Sellers (in such persons
capacity as a director or officer of the Sellers) to take any action, or to
refrain from taking any action, to the extent such action or forbearance is
inconsistent with its or their fiduciary obligations under applicable law,
as determined after consultation with outside

 



29  legal counsel), without further order of the Bankruptcy Court, to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement (as the same may be improved upon by the
Purchaser in the Auction) with the Purchaser.

(h) The Sellers shall serve notice of the Stalking Horse Motion, the Stalking
Horse Order, this Agreement, the proposed Sale Order and all deadlines and
material facts relating to the foregoing to all parties entitled to receive
notice thereof pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Bidding
Procedures Order and the Stalking Horse Motion and such notice is sufficient
under applicable Law to enable the Sellers to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the sale of the Acquired Assets to the
Purchaser free and clear of all Encumbrances to the full extent set forth in
the Sale Order.

Section 5.8 _Bankruptcy Filings_. From and after the Effective Date, the
Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to provide such prior notice as may be
reasonable under the circumstances before filing any papers in the Chapter 11
Cases that relate, in whole or in part, to this Agreement or to the Purchaser.
The Sellers inadvertent failure to comply with this _Section 5.8_ shall not
constitute a breach under this Agreement.

 

Section 5.9 _Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement_. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, and if approved by the Bankruptcy Court
pursuant to the Stalking Horse Order, the Sellers agree to pay the Purchaser
the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement Amount in accordance with
_Section 7.2(b)_ of this Agreement and the Stalking Horse Order. 

Section 5.10 _Bidding Procedures; Superior Offers_. The bidding procedures to
be employed with respect to this Agreement shall be those reflected in the
Bidding Procedures Order. The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that the
Sellers and their representatives and Affiliates are and may continue
soliciting inquiries, proposals or offers for the Business, the Acquired
Assets and the Interests in connection with alternative transactions pursuant
to the terms of the Bidding Procedures Order and agree and acknowledge that
the bidding procedures contained in the Bidding Procedures Order may be
supplemented by other customary procedures not inconsistent with the terms
otherwise set forth therein or the terms of this Agreement; provided, that (a)
the Sellers shall reasonably consult with the Purchaser in connection
therewith and (b) in no event shall the bidding procedures contained in the
Bidding Procedures Order be supplemented in any manner adverse to the
Purchaser without the Purchasers prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

Section 5.11 _Communications with Customers and Suppliers_. Prior to the
Closing, the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and
representatives not to, contact, or engage in any discussions or otherwise
communicate with, the Sellers customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees and
other Persons with which the Sellers have material commercial
dealings without obtaining the prior consent of the Sellers (other than any
such communication in the ordinary course of business of the Purchaser and
their Affiliates without reference to or any purpose relating to the Business,
the Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) or as permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



30 Section 5.12 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) As of the Closing, the Purchaser shall assume the Assumed Benefit Plans
and thereafter shall perform or cause to be performed all obligations of the
Sellers with respect to the Assumed Benefit Plans in accordance with the terms
thereof as in effect as of the Closing.

 

(b) Each of the individuals employed by the Sellers shall receive an offer of
employment from the Purchaser at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, or within five (5) Business Days of the applicable
date of hire with respect to any such individual hired by the Sellers within
the fifteen (15)-day period prior to the Closing Date. Subject to
the provisions of this _Section 5.12(b)_, each offer of employment shall
provide substantially the same terms and conditions in the aggregate as
provided to such individual by the Sellers as of immediately prior to the
Closing and provide that employment with the Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates shall commence effective as of the Closing. Each individual who
accepts the offer of employment pursuant to the prior sentence shall be deemed
a " _Transferred Employee_ " as of the Closing. For a period of one (1) year
following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to provide each Transferred Employee with (i) base salary or wage
rates that are not less than those in effect for each such Transferred
Employee immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) annual incentive
compensation opportunity, including equity compensation, and employee
benefits, that are no worse than those in effect for similarly situated
employees of the Purchaser. The Sellers shall cease to employ the Transferred
Employees immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
with respect to each Transferred Employee who is terminated without cause by
the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates during the one-year period that begins
immediately following the Closing, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of
its Affiliates to, provide such Transferred Employee with the same change of
control severance payments and benefits as provided by the Sellers and its
Affiliates under the Benefit Plan in which the Transferred Employee was
participating in immediately prior to Closing which would be either under the
Dendreon Corporation Severance Benefits Plan for Executive-Level Employees
(Vice Presidents and above) or the Dendreon Corporation Severance Benefits
Plan for Executive Director-Level and Below Employees.

 

(c) The Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide to
each Transferred Employee full credit for such Transferred Employees service
with the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates prior to the Closing
for all purposes, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit
accruals and determination of the level of benefits (including
vacation, severance and retirement benefits), under any benefit plan in which
such Transferred Employee participates on or following the Closing (including
severance as provided under _Section 5.12(b)_ herein) to the same extent
recognized by Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates immediately prior
to the Closing; provided, that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or
coverage. The Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to: (i)
waive any limitation on health and welfare coverage of such Transferred
Employees due to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, active employment
requirements, and requirements to show evidence of good health under any
applicable health and welfare plan of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
to the extent such Transferred Employees were covered under a similar Benefit
Plan and (ii) credit each such Transferred Employee with all eligible
payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by such

 



31  employee under any Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date during the year in
which the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which
any such employee has satisfied any applicable deductible and whether such
employee has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any benefit plan of the
Purchaser or any Affiliate for such year.

 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 5.12_ shall constitute or be construed as (i) an
amendment, termination or other modification of any employee benefit or
compensation plan or arrangement, or a restriction or other limitation on the
right of any party hereto to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any such
plans or arrangements, or (ii) a guarantee of employment for any period, or a
restriction or other limitation on the right of any party hereto to terminate
the employment of any individual at any time.

 

Section 5.13 _Letters of Credit_. At or prior to the Closing, the Purchaser
shall, with respect to each letter of credit described on _Section 5.13_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Existing Letters of Credit_ "), either
(a) cause replacement letters of credit to be issued to the beneficiaries of
such Existing Letter of Credit, obtain the originals of such Existing Letter
of Credit from the beneficiary thereof to return to the issuing financial
institution (" _Lender_ ") and deliver to Lender each such Existing Letter of
Credit or (b) provide arrangements satisfactory to the Lender that issued
such Existing Letter of Credit in the form of cash collateral, back-up letters
of credit or other credit support, in each case in a manner consented to by
Lender such that Lender will deliver to the Sellers on the Closing Date an
unconditional release of all of the obligations of the Sellers with respect to
such Existing Letter of Credit.

 

Section 5.14 _Post-Closing Books and Records_. For a period of seven (7) years
after the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be required by any
Governmental Entity, applicable Order or Law or any ongoing Action):

(a) the Purchaser shall not dispose of or destroy any of the business records
and files of the Business transferred to it hereunder; and

(b) the Purchaser shall allow the Sellers and any of their directors,
officers, employees, financial advisors, legal counsel, accountants,
consultants and other authorized representatives access to all business
records and files of the Sellers, the Non-Debtor Subs or the Business that
are transferred to the Purchaser hereunder, which are reasonably required by
the Sellers for purposes related to the Chapter 11 Cases, the wind-down of the
operations of the Sellers, the functions of any trusts or other successors to
the Sellers, Tax matters and other reasonable business purposes, during
regular business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, and the Sellers shall
have the right to make copies of any such records and files.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, during such period, the Purchaser may dispose
of any such business records or files of the Business which are offered to,
but not accepted by, the Sellers within ninety (90) days of receipt of such
offer.

Section 5.15 _Parent Confidentiality Agreements; Post-Closing
Confidentiality_.

(a) As of the Closing, the Purchasers obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement related to (i) non-use, non-disclosure and return or destruction of

 



32  Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to the
extent related to the Business, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities shall terminate and (ii) non-solicitation of employees shall
terminate with respect to the Transferred Employees; provided, that any action
of the Purchaser and its Affiliates pursuant to Section 5.12(b) shall not
constitute a violation of the Confidentiality Agreement. All other provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

 

(b) Effective at the Closing, the Parent hereby assigns to the Purchaser the
rights under the Parent Confidentiality Agreements to enforce the non-use,
non-disclosure and return or destruction of Evaluation Material (as such term
is defined in the Parent Confidentiality Agreements) to the extent related to
the Business, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities and the non-
solicitation provisions with respect to the Transferred Employees; provided,
that the Parent retains all other rights and remedies thereunder. The Parent
expressly disclaims any representation or warranty as to the enforceability of
any of such assigned provisions.

(c) For a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates and their respective directors
and officers not to, disclose to any Person other than the directors,
officers, employees and authorized representatives of the Purchaser and its
Affiliates, or use or otherwise exploit for their benefit, any Confidential
Information, except (i) pursuant to any Order, as required in any Action or as
otherwise required by applicable Law, (ii) to enforce its rights and remedies
under this Agreement or (iii) disclosure of Confidential Information in
connection with the Chapter 11 Cases shall not constitute a breach of this
_Section 5.15(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event disclosure is
required by applicable Law or in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, the
Sellers shall, to the extent reasonably possible, provide the Purchaser with
prompt notice of such requirement prior to making any disclosure so that the
Purchaser may seek at its own cost and expense an appropriate protective
order. " _Confidential Information_ " shall mean any proprietary or
confidential information to the extent related to the Business, the Acquired
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, excluding any information that (x) is (as
of the Closing Date) or becomes generally available to the public other than
as a result of a breach of this _Section 5.15(c)_ or (y) becomes available to
the Sellers, their Affiliates or their respective directors and officers after
the Closing Date on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the
Purchaser or their Affiliates, provided that such source is not, to the
knowledge of the Sellers, bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the
Purchaser or their Affiliates or any other party with respect to such
information.

Section 5.16  _Termination of Intercompany Agreements_. At or prior to the
Closing, the Sellers shall terminate, or shall cause to be terminated, with
respect to the Non-Debtor Subs, all Contracts between (a) any Non-Debtor Sub
on the one hand, and (b) any Seller on the other hand, relating to the
provision of services, cost-sharing, loan arrangements or any other
intercompany arrangement.

 

Section 5.17 _Payments Received_. The Sellers and the Purchaser each agree
that after the Closing they will hold and will promptly transfer and deliver
to the other, from time to time as and when received by them or their
respective Subsidiaries, any cash, checks with

 



33  appropriate endorsements (using their best efforts not to convert such
checks into cash) or other property that they may receive on or after the
Closing which properly belongs to the other party hereto or its Subsidiaries
and will account to the other for all such receipts.

Section 5.18 _Use of Names and Marks_. The Purchaser acknowledge and agree
that, notwithstanding the transfer of Intellectual Property included in the
Acquired Assets, (a) the Sellers will continue using their current corporate
names during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases and any additional time
during which the Sellers wind down their affairs, and (b) the Sellers shall be
entitled to refer to names and marks included in the Acquired Assets in
filings with Governmental Entities, for factual or historical reference
and for any other purposes that do not constitute trademark infringement and
are not otherwise prohibited by applicable Law.

 

Section 5.19 _NDC Code_. To the extent not transferred as part of the Acquired
Assets, the Sellers hereby grant, effective as of the Closing Date, to the
Purchaser (and the Purchasers Affiliates) a royalty-free, paid-up license
under the Sellers NDC numbers used in connection with the Business (including
the NDC number for the biologic Provenge) to the extent necessary to allow
the Purchaser and its Affiliates and their designees to market, distribute and
sell the inventory acquired as part of the Acquired Assets and any additional
inventory bearing such NDC numbers.

 

Section 5.20 _Updates to Schedule 1.1(e)_. The Purchaser shall have the right,
by written notice delivered to the Sellers at any time during the period from
and after the date hereof and until the Closing Date, to delete any Contract
or real property lease from _Schedule 1.1(e)_ ; provided, that the Purchaser
shall pay (or cause its designated Affiliate or Affiliates to pay) to the
Sellers an amount equal to the Rejection Costs, after the amount of the
Rejection Costs has been determined in accordance with the definition thereof,
and it being understood that any such Contract or real property deleted by
the Purchaser from such schedule may subsequently be rejected by the Sellers
in the Chapter 11 Cases; provided, however, the Sellers shall consider any
reasonable requests by the Purchaser following the Closing Date and prior to
confirmation of a chapter 11 plan with respect to the Sellers, that the
Sellers file a motion to assume and assign to the Purchaser such Contract or
real property lease rather than reject it. The Purchaser shall also have the
right by written notice delivered to the Sellers at any time during the
period from and after the date hereof and until the Closing Date to add any
Contract or real property lease to _Schedule 1.1(e)_ ; provided, that such
Contract or real property lease has not been previously rejected in the
Chapter 11 Cases.

_Section 7.1_, all rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement
shall terminate without any liability of any party to any other parties
hereto, except for liability for fraud or intentional breach of
this Agreement prior to such termination. The provisions of _Section
1.6(b)(ii)_, _Section 1.6(b)(iii)_, _Section 5.2(a)_, _Section 5.9_, this
_Section 7.2_ and _Article VIII_ (other than _Sections 8.1_ , _8.2_ and

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 7.2(a)_, if this Agreement is terminated (i)
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ or _Section 7.1(f)_, then the Sellers shall pay
to the Purchaser the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement Amount in full
and complete satisfaction of all of the Sellers obligations hereunder, or
(ii) pursuant to _Section 7.1(j)_ or _Section 7.1(n)_, then the Sellers

this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Sellers be required to pay

ARTICLE VIII

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

Section 8.1 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall file, or cause to be filed, when due (taking into account any
applicable extensions) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect to the Non-Debtor Subs on or prior to the Closing Date, and shall
pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns, to the
extent permitted under applicable Law. The Tax Returns of the Non-Debtor
Subs shall be prepared in accordance with the past practice, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



38 (b) All sales, use, excise, transfer, documentary, stamp, value added,
recordation, license, conveyance and other similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_
"), if any, payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne by the Purchaser and paid when due. The Sellers and
the Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to
reduce or eliminate any Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable
Law. The Purchaser shall be responsible for preparing and filing all Tax
Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes and shall file all such Tax Returns
when due; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any such Tax Return
requires execution by the Sellers, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to
the Sellers a draft copy of such Tax Return a reasonable amount of time prior
to the due date thereof for the Sellers review and comment, and the Sellers
shall promptly execute such Tax Return and deliver it to Purchaser three (3)
Business Days before the due date thereof, who shall cause it to be filed.

(c) As to any Acquired Asset acquired by the Purchaser, the Sellers and the
Purchaser shall apportion the liability for real and personal property Taxes,
ad valorem Taxes, and similar Taxes (" _Periodic Taxes_ ") for all Tax periods
including but not ending on the Closing Date applicable to such Acquired Asset
(all such periods of time being hereinafter called " _Proration Periods_ ").
The Periodic Taxes described in this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall be apportioned
between the Sellers and the Purchaser as of the Closing Date, with the
Purchaser liable for that portion of the Periodic Taxes equal to the Periodic
Tax for the Proration Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days remaining in the applicable Proration Period after the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total number of days
covered by such Proration Period. The Sellers shall be liable for that portion
of the Periodic Taxes for a Proration Period for which the Purchaser is not
liable under the preceding sentence. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall pay
or be reimbursed for Periodic Taxes (including instances in which such
Periodic Taxes have been paid before the Closing Date) on this prorated basis
at Closing. To the extent the liability for Periodic Taxes for a certain
Proration Period is not determinable at the time of Closing or such Periodic
Taxes are charged in arrears, such Periodic Taxes shall be prorated for such
Proration Period, based on the most recent ascertainable full tax year without
adjustment. The party hereto responsible under applicable Law for paying a
Tax described in this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall be responsible for administering
the payment of such Tax. For purposes of this _Section 8.1(c)_, the Proration
Period for ad valorem Taxes and real and personal property Taxes shall be the
fiscal period for which such Taxes were assessed by the applicable Tax

to be severable. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any Person not a party to this Agreement any rights or remedies

43 Section 8.15 _Specific Performance; Sole and Exclusive Remedy for Seller
Breach_.

 

(a) The parties hereto recognize that if the Purchaser breaches this Agreement
or refuses to perform under the provisions of this Agreement, monetary
damages alone would not be adequate to compensate the Sellers for their
injuries. The Sellers shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any other
remedies that may be available, to obtain specific performance of the terms of
this Agreement, without posting bond or other undertaking. If any Action is
brought by the Sellers to enforce this Agreement, the Purchaser shall waive
the defense that there is an adequate remedy at Law.

the Sellers agreements, covenants, representations or warranties contained

breach that is material or willful, the Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy
shall be to exercise the Purchasers rights to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_, in accordance with the terms of such _Section
7.1(d)_, and to receive payment of the Break-Up Fee and/or the Expense
Reimbursement Amount (as the case may be) as provided in  _Section 7.2(b)_,
and the Purchaser shall not have any further cause of action for damages,
specific performance or any other legal or equitable relief against the
Sellers or any of their respective former, current or future
equityholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or representatives
with respect thereto.
