ARTICLE I 

_The Merger

The Merger shall become effective upon such filing or at such time thereafter as is provided in the Articles of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 1.3 _ Closing of the Merger._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at a time and on a date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), at the offices of Ater Wynne LLP, 222 S.W. Columbia Street, Suite 1800, Portland, Oregon 97201, or at such time, date, or place as agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. 

  

 1.4 _ Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger, and the applicable provisions of the CGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the properties, rights, privileges, powers, and franchises of the Company and MergerSub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, and duties of the Company and MergerSub shall become the debts, liabilities, and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.5 _ Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws._ Effective immediately following the Merger, the articles of incorporation of MergerSub, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. Effective immediately following the Merger, the bylaws of MergerSub, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.6 _ Directors and Officers._ The directors and officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall resign as of the Effective Time. The directors of MergerSub at the Effective Time shall become the directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal. The officers of MergerSub at the Effective Time shall become the officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal. 

       
ARTICLE II 

_Effect of Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations 
_

  

 2.1 _ Conversion of Shares._ 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of common stock of MergerSub shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, MergerSub, or the Company, be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) Subject to Section 2.3, each issued and outstanding share of Company Preferred Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares as defined in and to the extent provided in Section 2.12) shall be converted as follows: (i) _first_ , each issued and outstanding share of Series B Company Preferred Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares as defined in and to the extent provided in Section 2.12) shall be converted into the right to receive (1) unless otherwise previously waived by the applicable Series B Company Preferred Stock holder in a writing in form and substance satisfactory to Parent, a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (" _Series B Liquidation Shares_") with a value equal to the liquidation preference per each such share of Series B Company Preferred Stock as described in Section 2(a) of the Company\'s Second Restated and Amended Articles of Incorporation (" _Company\'s Restated Articles_ ") and (2) the additional shares of Parent Common Stock described in clause (iii) below; (ii) _second_ , each issued and outstanding share of Series A Company Preferred Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares as defined in and to the extent provided in Section 2.12) shall be converted into the right to receive (1) unless otherwise previously waived by the applicable Series A Company Preferred Stock holder in a writing in form and substance satisfactory to Parent, a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (" _Series A Liquidation Shares_") with a value equal to the liquidation preference per each such share of Series A Company Preferred Stock as described in Section 2(b) of the Company\'s Restated Articles and (2) the additional shares of Parent Common Stock described in clause (iii) below;; and (iii) _third_ , after giving effect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, each issued and outstanding share of Company Preferred Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares as defined in and to the extent provided in Section 2.12) shall be converted into the right to receive a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the "Exchange Ratio," provided that for purposes of making the calculations under this clause (iii), the holders of the Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated as if all of the shares of Company Preferred Stock had been converted to Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of the prior sentence, the value per share of Parent Common Stock shall be the Parent Stock Price. " _Parent Stock Price_ " means the closing price of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Composite Transactions Reporting System as reported in the Wall Street Journal for the date of this Agreement (or if the date of this Agreement is not a trading date, the last trading date immediately before the date of this Agreement). After giving effect to the conversion of the Company Preferred Stock as described above, subject to Section 2.3, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares as defined in and to the extent provided in Section 2.12) shall be converted into the right to receive a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the "Exchange Ratio." " _Exchange Ratio_ " means the number determined by dividing (A) 4,500,000 less the sum of (i) the number of Series A Liquidation Shares plus (ii) the number of Series B Liquidation Shares, by (B) the Fully-Diluted Shares. " _Fully-Diluted Shares_ " means the sum of (i) aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be issued to the holders of Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time if such Company Preferred Stock were converted into Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) all Company Common Stock issuable under options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested (each a " _Company Stock Option_ "), (iv) all Company Common Stock issuable under stock options which the Company commits before the 

    Effective Time to issue under the Company Option Plan but which have not yet
been issued by the Company as of the Effective Time, and (iv) the aggregate
number of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to any and all outstanding
warrants, calls, subscriptions, conversion (except for the Company Common
Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Company Preferred Stock to the
extent included in clause (ii) above), exchange, or other similar rights,
agreements, or commitments to acquire any shares of Company capital stock,
treated as if converted or exercised for Company Common Stock. The Company is
representing and warranting under Section 3.4 that (i) each share of Company
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time is
entitled to be converted, immediately prior to the Effective Time, into one
(1) share of Company Common Stock, (ii) the liquidation preference under
Section 2(a) of the Company\'s Restated Articles is $1.00 per share of Series
B Preferred Stock, and (iii) the liquidation preference under Section 2(b) of
the Company\'s Restated Articles is $0.50 per share of Series A Preferred
Stock. In no event shall the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable under this section in exchange for all of the Company Capital
Stock exceed a number equal to (i) 4,500,000 less (ii) the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock subject to the Substitute Stock Options.

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company, Parent or MergerSub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof. 

  

 (d) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event, the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or such similar event. 

  

 2.2 _ Stock Options._ As soon as practical following the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Board of Director of the Company administering the Company stock option plans or arrangements (the " _Company Option Plan_ ")) shall take such action, and the Company shall obtain such agreements and consents, if any, as may be required to effect the following provisions of this Section 2.2. As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall be replaced by a new substitute option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock granted under the terms of Parent\'s stock option plan (in each case, a " _Substitute Stock Option_ ") as follows: 

  

 (a) In respect of any Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Substituted Stock Option shall be the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock under the Substitute Stock Option shall be the quotient (rounded up to the nearest $0.01) of the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. 

  

 (b) In respect of any other Company Stock Option, (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Substituted Stock Option shall be the product (rounded up to the nearest whole share) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock under the Substitute Stock Option shall be the quotient (rounded down to the nearest $0.01) of the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. 

  

 (c) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.2, each Substituted Stock Option shall be subject to equivalent terms and conditions (including expiration date and vesting and exercise 

    provisions) as were applicable to the applicable Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and, in respect of any Company Stock
Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its
qualification under Section 422 of the Code, such terms and conditions shall
be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code.

  

 Parent shall take all corporate action and comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws necessary to reserve for issuance under an appropriate stock option plan of Parent a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of all Substituted Stock Options. 

  

 2.3 _ Payment Procedures._ As of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall act as Paying Agent (in such capacity, the " _Paying Agent_ "). Upon surrender of a certificate or certificates (" _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (collectively, the " _Company Capital Stock_ ") to the Paying Agent and a letter of transmittal in customary form and with such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) shares of Parent Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ (after taking into account all shares of Company Capital Stock then held by such holder and subject to the deposit of a portion of such shares in the Escrow Fund) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash in lieu of any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.6_. With respect to those shares of Company Capital Stock for which Certificates and a Letter of Transmittal are delivered to Parent at the Closing, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in exchange for the share of Company Capital Stock under Section 2.1(b) (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") (less the portion thereof to be deposited in the Escrow Fund) that such holder is entitled to receive shall be delivered to such holder at soon as practicable after the Closing (but in no event later than five business days). As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Depositary Agent, pursuant to _Article IX_, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be placed in the Escrow Fund. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to _Section 2.4_ or _2.6_. If the Merger Consideration (or any portion thereof) is to be delivered to any person other than the person in whose name the Certificate representing the shares of Company Capital Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of such consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

  

 2.4 _ Distributions in Respect of Unsurrendered Certificates._ No dividends or other distributions declared or made in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate in respect of the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.6_ until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.3_. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.6_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid in respect of such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time, but prior to such surrender, and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender, payable in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock. 

     2.5 _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock._ All
shares of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of the
shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with this _Article II_
(including any cash paid pursuant to _Sections 2.4_  and _2.6_ ) shall be
deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock.

  

 2.6 _ No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock._ 

  

 (a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock exchanged in connection with the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the Parent Stock Price. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Paying Agent shall notify Parent and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. 

  

 2.7 _ No Liability._ Any such portion of the Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Capital Stock five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, MergerSub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered, in good faith, to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar law. 

  

 2.8 _ Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity by such person against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation in respect of such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.6_,  and any dividends and distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4_. 

  

 2.9 _ Withholding Rights._ Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold in respect of the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and regulations thereunder, or any provision of a Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder of Company Capital Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. 

  

 2.10 _ Tax Consequences._ It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each party hereto shall use its best efforts to cause the Merger to be so qualified, shall report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with such reorganization treatment and will not take any position 

    inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return, refund claim, litigation, or
otherwise unless required to do so by applicable law.

  

 2.11 _ Stock Transfer Books._ The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent for any reason shall be converted into Parent Common Stock in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.6_, and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4_. 

  

 2.12 _ Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by shareholders who did not vote in favor of the Merger (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), and the holders of which comply with all of the applicable provisions of the CGCL (the " _Dissenting Shareholders_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their dissenters\' rights under the CGCL. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as though such shares of Company Capital Stock had been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the CGCL and received by the Company relating to shareholders\' rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings in respect of demands for appraisal under the CGCL. Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment in respect of, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment.

ARTICLE IV 

_Representations and Warranties of the Company 
_

  

 Subject to the Company\'s Disclosure Schedules attached hereto (which schedules identify by specific section number the exceptions thereto), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and MergerSub as follows (with the understanding that Parent and MergerSub are relying materially on each such representation and warranty in entering into and performing this Agreement):

    shares of capital stock of the Company. There are no shareholder agreements,
voting trusts, or other agreements to which the Company is a party or to which

Company (other than the Voting Agreement entered into in connection with this
Agreement). The Company has not issued any stock appreciation rights or other
rights related to equity participation, and the Company has no debt
instruments outstanding that have any voting rights. _Schedule 4.1(c)_ sets

Section 102 or a bar to patentability under the absolute novelty standard as applied in the European Patent Office. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no inventors of the Patent Applications or any other inventions that improve on, are derived from, or address the same problem as that of the Patent Applications who do not have an obligation to assign to the Company the rights in the Patent Applications or any other inventions that improve on, are derived from, or address the same problem as that of the Patent Applications.

No third person has interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated, or otherwise come into conflict with any Intellectual Property rights of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of, and in addition to, the foregoing, Optoma Corp. (formerly known as CTX Opto Electronics Corp.)

 4.32 _ Information Furnished._ Neither the representations or warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement nor the statements made by the Company in the Schedules attached hereto contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements herein or therein, as the case may be, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 8.2 _ Termination by Either Parent or the Company._ This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action of the Board of Directors 

    of either Parent or the Company upon the occurrence of a Termination Event;
_provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 8.2_ shall not be available to any party that has breached
in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any
manner that shall have proximately contributed to the occurrence of the
failure of the Merger to be consummated. For the purposes of this Agreement, a
" _Termination Event_ " is deemed to occur if:

  

 (a) the Merger shall not have been consummated by January 31, 2001, whether such date is before or after the date of approval of the Merger by the Company Requisite Vote (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided, however, that if any condition of Closing set forth in Section 7.1 that remains capable of satisfaction has not been fulfilled or waived prior to January 31, 2001 the Termination Date shall automatically extend to March 31, 2001; or 

  

 (b) any Law or Order permanently restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger shall become final and non-appealable (whether before or after the approval of the Merger by the Company Requisite Vote or Shareholder Consent). 

  

 8.3 _ Termination by the Company._ This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the approval of the Merger by the Company Requisite Vote, by action of the Board of Directors of the Company if there is a breach by Parent or MergerSub of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement contained in this Agreement that cannot be cured and would cause a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ to be incapable of being satisfied as of the Termination Date. 

  

 8.4 _ Termination by Parent._ This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the approval of the Merger by the Company Requisite Vote, by action of the Board of Directors of Parent if: 

  

 (a) there is a breach by the Company or any shareholder of the Company of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement contained in this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in connection with this Agreement that cannot be cured and would cause a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ to be incapable of being satisfied as of the Termination Date; or 

  

 (b) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement in a manner adverse to Parent or shall have resolved to do the foregoing. 

  

 8.5 _ Effect of Termination and Abandonment._ In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this _Article VIII_, this Agreement (other than this _Section 8.5_, _Section  6.14_, and _Article X_) shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives);  _provided, however_ , that except as otherwise provided herein, no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any willful breach of this Agreement. 

  

 8.6 _ Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by action taken by the Company, Parent, and MergerSub (and the Depositary Agent if its rights, duties or obligations are affected by such amendment) at any time before or after approval of the Merger by the Company Requisite Vote or Unanimous Consent but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made that changes the amount or form of the Merger Consideration.

    Any agreement on the part of either party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its
rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  

    
ARTICLE IX 

_Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants, and Agreements; Escrow
Provisions 
_

  

 9.1 _ Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements; Escrow Provisions._ Notwithstanding any right of Parent, MergerSub, or the Company (whether or not exercised) to investigate the affairs of Parent, MergerSub, or the Company or any diligence review or investigation conducted by Parent or its Representatives, each party shall have the right to rely fully upon the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any instrument required to be delivered pursuant to _Article VII_. The covenants and agreements of the Company, Parent, and MergerSub contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time. The representations and warranties of the Company, Parent, and MergerSub contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger and continue until the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Expiration Date_ "). Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, none of Parent, MergerSub, or the Company has made any representations or warranties and, except for the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, each of Parent, MergerSub and the Company acknowledges that no representations or warranties have been made by, and it has not relied upon any representations or warranties made by, any of the parties hereto or any of their respective Representatives in respect of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and the documents and instruments referred to herein, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to such party or its Representatives of any documentation or other information in respect of any one or more of the foregoing. The inclusion of any entry on the Schedules attached hereto shall not constitute an admission by, or agreement of, the Company that such matter is material to the Company. 

  

 9.2 _ Escrow Provisions._ 

  

 (a) _ Establishment of the Escrow Fund._ " _Escrow Amount_ " and " _Escrow Fund_ " means the number of shares of Parent Common Stock obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable by Parent at the Effective Time to holders of Company Capital Stock in accordance with _Section 2.1_ by (ii) 20%. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Escrow Amount, without any act of any shareholder, will be deposited with Mellon Investor Services LLC (the " _Depositary Agent_ ") (plus a proportionate share of any additional shares of Parent Common Stock as may be issued upon any stock splits, stock dividends, or recapitalizations effected by Parent following the Effective Time). The Escrow Fund will be governed by the terms set forth herein and shall be maintained at Parent\'s sole cost and expense. The portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each shareholder of the Company shall be in proportion to the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled under _Section 2.1_. The Depositary Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to verify or confirm the accuracy and sufficiency of the Escrow Amount deposited with it. Prior to or simultaneous with the deposit of the Escrow Amount with the Depositary Agent, and upon each issuance of any additional shares, Parent shall deliver to the Depositary Agent a writing setting forth the portion of such Escrow Amount deemed to be each shareholders\' proportionate interest. 

  

 (b) _ Recourse to the Escrow Fund; Other Liability of Signing Company Shareholders._ The Escrow Fund shall be available to jointly and severally compensate Parent and the Surviving Corporation for any and all Losses (whether or not involving a Third Party Claim) incurred or sustained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation directly or indirectly, as a result of (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of the Company or any shareholder of the Company 

    contained herein or in any other agreement or document executed in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that survives
the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation may not make any claims against the Escrow Fund unless the
aggregate Losses incurred or sustained exceed $50,000 (at which such time
claims may be made for all such Losses incurred or sustained in excess of such
amount); and (ii) the failure by the Company to have any workers compensation
insurance in place for any time prior to the Closing Date (and the $50,000
threshold to liability shall not apply to this clause (ii)). Without limiting,
and in addition to, the rights of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to
recover against the Escrow Fund, if the Merger is not consummated, the Company
and the Signing Company Shareholders or, if the Merger is consummated, the
Signing Company Shareholders (and not the Surviving Corporation) shall
severally but not jointly hold harmless and indemnify from and against, and
shall compensate and reimburse Parent and the Surviving Corporation for, any
and all Losses which are suffered or incurred by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (regardless of whether or not such Losses related to any third
party claim) arising from: (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or in any
other agreement or document executed in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) any reasonable costs arising from the
defense by the Surviving Corporation or Parent of any claim relating to a
matter for which the Signing Company Shareholders bear indemnification
obligations hereunder, or the enforcement by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent of its rights to indemnification hereunder; and (iii) the failure by
the Company to have any workers compensation insurance in place for any time
prior to the Closing Date. The limitations to the several indemnification
obligations of the Signing Company Shareholders under this section are as
follows (but such limitations shall not apply to the reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, including
reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses, awarded by any court, arbitrator or
other tribunal): (i) the Signing Company Shareholders shall have no limit on
their respective obligations for Losses resulting from any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement made herein or
in any other agreement or document executed in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Company or the shareholders
of the Company of which the Signing Company Shareholder had knowledge on or
prior to the Closing; and (ii) the aggregate obligation of the Signing
Company Shareholders for any Losses arising from any indemnification
obligations set forth in the prior sentence other than as specified in (i)
above shall be limited to the value of the Parent Common Stock received by the
Signing Company Shareholders in the Merger, valued at the Parent Stock Price,
and the obligation of each Signing Company Shareholder for any Losses arising
from any indemnification obligations set forth in the prior sentence other
than as specified in (i) above shall be limited to the proportion of the
value of the Parent Common Stock received by the Signing Company Shareholders
in the Merger, valued at the Parent Stock Price.

  

 (c) _ Escrow Period; Distribution of Escrow Fund upon Termination of Escrow Period._ Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 P.M., Pacific Time, on the Expiration Date (the period from the Effective Time through and including the Expiration Date is referred to as the " _Escrow Period_ "); and all shares of Parent Common Stock remaining in the Escrow Fund shall be distributed by the Depositary Agent (as provided to the Depositary Agent by Parent in writing) ratably in proportion to each shareholders\' respective contributions to the Escrow Fund (as provided to the Depositary Agent by Parent in writing) and Parent shall use all its commercially reasonable efforts to have such shares delivered within five business days after the Expiration Date; _provided, however_ , that the Escrow Period shall not terminate in respect of such amount (or some portion thereof) that is necessary in the reasonable judgment of Parent, subject to the objection of the Shareholder Agent and the subsequent resolution of the matter in the manner as provided in _Section 9.2(g)_, to satisfy any unsatisfied written claims under this _Section 9.2_ concerning facts and circumstances existing prior to the termination of such Escrow Period which claims are specified in any Officer\'s Certificate delivered to the Depositary Agent prior to termination of such Escrow Period. Upon resolution of each individual claim described above and upon 

    specific written instructions by Parent and the Shareholder Agent, the
Depositary Agent shall deliver the remaining amount, if any, of the portion of
the Escrow Fund designated for such individual claim after the resolution of
such claim to the shareholders of the Company. Deliveries to the shareholders
of the Company of shares of Parent Common Stock remaining in the Escrow Fund
following the Expiration Date shall be made ratably in proportion to their
respective contributions to the Escrow Fund (as provided to the Depositary
Agent by Parent in writing) and Parent shall use all its commercially
reasonable efforts to have such shares delivered within five business days
after the date of such resolution.

  

 (d) _ Protection of Escrow Fund._ 

  

  

 (i) The Depositary Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and not as the property of Parent or the Surviving Corporation and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms hereof. 

  

 (ii) Any shares of Parent Common Stock, or other securities that, by their terms, are or may be exercisable, convertible, or exchangeable, for or into Parent Common Stock, that are issued or distributed by Parent (" _New Shares_ ") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund that have not been released from the Escrow Fund shall be added to the Escrow Fund. New Shares issued in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock that have been released from the Escrow Fund shall not be added to the Escrow Fund, but shall be distributed to the record holders thereof. Cash dividends on Parent Common Stock shall not be added to the Escrow Fund, but shall be distributed to the record holders of the Parent Common Stock on the record date set for any such dividend at the written direction of Parent, which shall contain all shareholder information required by the Depositary Agent. 

  

 (iii) Each shareholder shall have voting rights in respect of the shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to the account of such shareholder within the Escrow Fund (and on any voting securities added to the Escrow Fund in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Depositary Agent shall have no duty or obligation to monitor or take any action with respect to the foregoing paragraph. 

  

  

 (e) _ Claims Upon Escrow Fund._ 

  

  

 (i) Upon receipt by the Depositary Agent, at any time on or before the last day of the Escrow Period of a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an " _Officer\'s Certificate_ "): (A) stating that Parent or the Surviving Corporation has paid or properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay or accrue Losses, directly or indirectly, as a result of any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of the Company or the shareholders of the Company contained herein or in any agreement or other document executed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any covenant or agreement of the Company or the shareholders of the Company to be performed by it prior to the Effective Time, and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid or properly accrued or the basis for such anticipated liability, the nature of the misrepresentation or breach of warranty, agreement, or covenant to which such item is related (including the specific provision breached) and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to it from the Escrow Fund, the Depositary Agent shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 9.2(f)_, deliver to Parent out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to such Losses. 

  

 (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Losses_ " means all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses), damages, liabilities, fines, penalties, judgments, actions, claims, and costs. 

  

    

  (iii) For the purposes of determining the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to be delivered to Parent out of the Escrow Fund pursuant to
_Section 9.2(e)(i)_, the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at
the Parent Stock Price. The Depositary Agent is not responsible for making
such calculation. The exact number of shares to be delivered will be provided
to the Depositary Agent by Parent.

  

  

 (f) _ Objections to Claims._ At the time of delivery of any Officer\'s Certificate to the Depositary Agent, a duplicate copy of such certificate shall be delivered to the Shareholder Agent and for a period of 30 days after delivery to the Depositary Agent (with such copy to the Shareholder Agent), the Depositary Agent shall make no delivery to Parent of any Escrow Amounts pursuant to _Section 9.2(e)_ unless the Depositary Agent shall have received written authorization from the Shareholder Agent to make such delivery. After the expiration of such 30-day period, the Depositary Agent shall make delivery of shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance with _Section 9.2(e)_; _provided, however_ , that no such payment or delivery may be made if the Shareholder Agent shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer\'s Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the Depositary Agent prior to the expiration of such 30-day period. 

  

 (g) _ Resolution of Conflicts._ In the event the Shareholder Agent timely objects in writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer\'s Certificate, the Shareholder Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties in respect of each of such claims. If the Shareholder Agent and Parent should so agree, joint written instructions setting forth such agreement and the precise number of shares to be delivered to each party shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Depositary Agent. The Depositary Agent shall be fully protected and shall be entitled to rely on any such instructions and distribute shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either Parent or the Shareholder Agent may commence litigation or, upon written consent of Parent and the Shareholder Agent, binding arbitration to resolve the dispute. 

  

 9.3 _ Shareholder Agent of the Shareholders; Power of Attorney._ 

   

 (a) _ Shareholder Agent._ In the event that the Merger is approved by the shareholders of the Company, effective upon such vote, and without further act of any shareholder, Yukuang Wang and Wade Chang shall be appointed as the agents and attorneys-in-fact (the " _Shareholder Agent_ "), either of whom may take actions as Shareholder Agent without the jointer of the other, for each shareholder of the Company (except such shareholders, if any, as shall have perfected their dissenters\' rights under the CGCL), for and on behalf of shareholders of the Company, to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent and the Depositary Agent, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand litigation or arbitration and comply with orders and awards of courts and arbitrators in respect of such claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholder Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the shareholders of the Company from time to time upon not less than 30 days\' prior written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that the Shareholder Agent may not be removed unless the holders of at least a two-thirds\' interest in the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted shareholder agent. Any vacancy in the position of Shareholder Agent may be filled by approval of the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. Upon any change of the Shareholder Agent, Parent will promptly deliver to the Depositary Agent notice of such change, as well as a specimen signature of such Shareholder Agent. Prior to receiving such notice and specimen signature, the Depositary Agent need not recognize any change in the Shareholder Agent. No bond shall be required of the Shareholder Agent, and the Shareholder Agent shall not receive compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or from the Shareholder Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the shareholders of the Company. 

     (b) _ Exculpation._ The Shareholder Agent shall not be liable for any
act done or omitted hereunder as Shareholder Agent while acting in good faith
and in the exercise of reasonable judgment.

  

 (c) _ Actions of the Shareholder Agent._ A decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Shareholder Agent shall constitute a decision for all of the shareholders of the Company for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise issuable to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund, and shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon each of such shareholders, and the Depositary Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Shareholder Agent as being the decision, act, consent, or instruction of every such shareholder of the Company. The Depositary Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Shareholder Agent. 

  

 9.4 _ Third-Party Claims._ In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation receives written notice of a third-party claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") that Parent reasonably expects may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund, Parent shall provide the Shareholder Agent with reasonably prompt written notice thereof. The Shareholder Agent, as representative for the shareholders of the Company, shall have the right to participate in or, by giving written notice to Parent, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the expense of the Escrow Fund and by counsel selected by the Shareholder Agent (which counsel must be reasonably satisfactory to Parent), and Parent will cooperate in good faith (and shall be permitted to participate at Parent\'s expense) in such defense; _provided, however_ , that the Shareholder Agent shall not be entitled to assume control of the defense of any Third Party Claim that (i) could reasonably be expected to have any material impact on the ongoing operations or goodwill of the Surviving Corporation or Parent or (ii) could reasonably be expected to result in Losses in excess of the Escrow Fund. Parent shall not settle any Third Party Claim without the consent of the Shareholder Agent, which consent will not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed, or withheld. The Shareholder Agent shall not settle any Third Party Claim without the consent of Parent, which consent will not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed, or withheld. In the event that the Shareholder Agent has consented to any such settlement, the Shareholder Agent shall have no power or authority to object under any provision of this _Article IX_ to the amount of any claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund with respect to the amount of Losses incurred by Parent in such settlement as consented to by the Shareholder Agent. 

  

 9.5 _ Depositary Agent\'s Duties._ 

  

 (a) _ Limitation on Duties of Depositary Agent._ The Depositary Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein (and no implied duties), and as set forth in any additional written escrow instructions that the Depositary Agent may receive after the date of this Agreement that are signed by an officer of Parent and the Shareholder Agent (and which are acceptable to the Depositary Agent), and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting, in good faith, on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. 

  

 (b) _ Compliance with Orders._ The Depositary Agent is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey Orders of any Governmental Entity notwithstanding any notices, warnings, or other communications from any party or any other person to the contrary.

 (c) _ Limitations on Liability of Depositary Agent._ The Depositary Agent shall not be liable:

in respect of this Agreement or any documents deposited with the Depositary
Agent.

  

  

 (d) _ Good Faith of Depositary Agent._ In performing or omitting to perform any duties under this Agreement, the Depositary Agent shall be fully protected and shall not be liable to any person for damages, losses, liabilities, penalties, claims, fees, settlements, judgments, costs or expenses, except for those attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depositary Agent (each as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction). Any liability of the Depositary Agent under this Agreement will be limited to the amount of fees paid to the Depositary Agent. The Depositary Agent shall not incur any such liability for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement, instructions or affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Depositary Agent shall believe to be genuine, nor will the Depositary Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative authority.

The Depositary Agent may hold all documents and shares of Parent Common Stock and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Depositary Agent\'s discretion, the Depositary Agent may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Depositary Agent will be fully protected and shall not be liable for any damages. Furthermore, the Depositary Agent may, at its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Depositary Agent is authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and shares of Parent Common Stock held in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges, and reasonable attorneys\' fees incurred by the Depositary Agent due to the interpleader action and which Parent and the Shareholder Agent, on behalf of the shareholders of the Company, jointly and severally agree to pay. Upon initiating such action, the Depositary Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from all obligations and liability imposed by this Agreement. 

  

 (f) _ Indemnification of Depositary Agent._ The Depositary Agent shall be indemnified and saved harmless by Parent, from and against any and all liability, fee, loss, claim, penalty, fine, settlement, or damages, including all expenses reasonably incurred, to which the Depositary Agent shall be subject by reason of entering into this Agreement, any action taken, suffered, or omitted to be taken or any disbursement of any part of the Escrow Fund made by the Depositary Agent pursuant to this Agreement, except as a result of the Depositary Agent\'s own gross negligence or willful misconduct (each as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction). The costs and expenses of enforcing this right of indemnification shall also be paid by Parent. The right of indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the removal or resignation of the Depositary Agent. 

  

 (g) _ Resignation of Depositary Agent._ The Depositary Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least 30 days\' written notice to the parties hereto; _provided, however_ , that no such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor Depositary Agent which shall be accomplished as follows: the parties shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on a successor Depositary Agent within 30 days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor Depositary Agent within such time, the Depositary Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor Depositary Agent or to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor. The successor Depositary Agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, 

    without further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties, rights,
powers, and duties of the predecessor Depositary Agent as if originally named
as Depositary Agent. Upon such succession, the original Depositary Agent
shall be discharged from any further duties and liability under this
Agreement. If the Depositary Agent consolidates with, merges or converts into,
or transfers all or substantially all of its business or assets to, another
person, the resulting, surviving, or transferee entity without any further act
will be the successor Depositary Agent.

  

 (h) _ Fees._ Except as set forth in _Section 9.5(e)_, all fees of the Depositary Agent for performance of its duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Depositary Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if the parties request a substantial modification of its terms (which are acceptable to the Depositary Agent), or if any controversy arises, or if the Depositary Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any action, suit, or proceeding pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the Depositary Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys\' fees, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy, or action, suit, or proceeding. If the Depositary Agent is not paid such fees as provided herein, it shall retain Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund in an amount it reasonably deems sufficient to satisfy such fees and expenses. 

  

 (i) _ Liability._ Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Depositary Agent be liable to any person for any special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, even if the Depositary Agent has been previously advised of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
