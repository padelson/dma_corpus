THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of May 29, 2007
is among Genzyme Corporation ("Parent"), a Massachusetts corporation, Wichita
Bio Corporation ("Sub"), a newly-formed Delaware corporation and a direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and Bioenvision, Inc. (the
"Company"), a Delaware corporation.

  

 **R E C I T A L S**

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Sub and the Company has
approved, and deems it advisable and in the best interests of the respective
corporation to consummate, the acquisition of the Company by Parent upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that Sub commence a cash
tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted by
this Agreement, the "Offer") to acquire (1) all shares of the issued and
outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
(including the associated preferred stock purchase rights issued under the
Company Rights Agreement (as defined below), the "Company Common Stock"), for
$5.60 for each share of Company Common Stock, net to the seller in cash (such
price, or any such higher price per share of Company Common Stock as may be
paid in the Offer, referred to herein as the "Offer Price") and (2) all
shares of the issued and outstanding Series A Convertible Participating
Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Convertible Preferred Stock" and together with the Company Common Stock, the
"Company Capital Stock"), for the sum of (a) the product of (i) two (2)
multiplied by (ii) the Offer Price for each share of Company Preferred Stock
plus (b) all accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to such shares as of
the Acceptance Date, net to the seller in cash;

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Sub and the Company has approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger
(as defined in Section 1.3(a)) following the Offer in accordance with the
Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") and upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein;

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board
of Directors") has resolved to recommend that the holders of such shares
of Company Capital Stock accept the Offer and adopt this Agreement and each
of the transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parent entering into this Agreement, certain
Company stockholders (the "Principal Shareholders") have entered into tender
and voting agreements, dated as of the date hereof, in substantially the form
set forth in Annex II hereof, pursuant to which, among other things, each of
the Principal Shareholders has agreed to tender his, her or its shares
of Company Capital Stock to Sub in the Offer; and     



  

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective covenants, agreements, representations and warranties set forth
herein, the parties agree as follows:

  

# SECTION 1 - THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

  

## 1.1 _The Offer_.

  

### (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Section 8.1 and none of the events set forth in Annex I
hereto shall have occurred (unless waived by Parent or Sub), Sub shall
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the "Exchange Act")) the Offer as promptly as practicable
following the date hereof.  The obligations of Sub to accept for payment and
to pay for any shares of Company Capital Stock validly tendered and not
withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in
accordance with requirements of this Section 1.1(a)) shall be subject only to
the conditions set forth in Annex I hereto. Subject to the prior satisfaction
or waiver by Parent or Sub of the conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex
I hereto, Sub shall consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and
accept for payment and pay for all shares of Company Capital Stock tendered
and not withdrawn promptly following the acceptance of shares of Company
Capital Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer. The Offer shall be made by
means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") that contains the
terms set forth in this Agreement and the conditions set forth in Annex I
hereto. Parent expressly reserves the right to waive any of such conditions,
to increase the Offer Price and to make any other changes in the terms of the
Offer; _provided, however,_  that Sub shall not, and Parent shall cause Sub
not to, decrease the Offer Price, change the form of consideration payable in
the Offer, decrease the number of shares of Company Capital Stock sought in
the Offer, impose additional conditions to the Offer or extend the offer
beyond a date that is twenty-one (21) business days after commencement of the
Offer or the last extension (in accordance with this Section 1.1), if any, of
the Offer, whichever is later (the "Expiration Date") except as set forth
below, in each case without the prior written consent of the Company (such
consent to be authorized by the Company Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sub may,
without the consent of the Company (i) extend the Offer beyond the initial
expiration date if, at any scheduled (or extended) expiration of the Offer,
any of the conditions to Subs obligation to accept shares of Company
Capital Stock for payment, shall not be satisfied or waived; provided, that
in no event shall any extension (or re-extension) pursuant to this clause (i)
extend past the date that is 10 business days after the initial expiration
date of the Offer, or (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by any
rule, regulation or interpretation of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC"), or the staff thereof, applicable to the Offer.
 In addition, to the extent requested by the Company in writing at least two
trading days before the then scheduled Expiration Date, Sub shall
be obligated to extend the Offer for one extension period of ten (10)
business days. In addition to the foregoing and excluded from any such
limitations, Sub also

        

may provide a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act.

  

### (b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file
with the SEC, pursuant to Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act ("Regulation
M-A"), a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule TO"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements
thereto, the "Offer Documents"). Subject to Section 5.2, the Company hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation and
the approval of the Company Board of Directors referred to in Section
3.20(a). Parent and Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of shares of
Company Capital Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by Law. Parent and Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to
cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Capital Stock, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
TO and any amendment thereto before it is filed with the SEC. In addition,
Parent and Sub agree to provide the Company with any comments, whether
written or oral, that Parent, Sub or their counsel may receive from time to
time prior to the expiration or termination of the Offer, from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents, promptly upon receipt of
such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto, and the Company
shall have the right to consult with Parent, Sub and their counsel prior to
responding to any such comments, either in written or oral form.

  

### (c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Sub promptly
following the expiration of the Offer or any subsequent extension thereof, as
applicable, all funds necessary to accept for payment any shares of Company
Capital Stock that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer and that Sub is obligated to accept for payment pursuant to the
Offer and permitted to accept for payment under applicable Law and Sub shall
maintain such funds exclusively for such purpose.

  

## 1.2 _Company Actions_.

  

### (a) Subject to Section 5.2 and to any consents or approvals of the
Companys stockholders required under applicable Law, the Company hereby
approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

### (b) On the date the Offer is commenced, the Company shall, in a manner
that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a
Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule 14D-9") which shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.2,
contain the recommendation and the approval of the Company Board of Directors
referred to in Section 3.20(a). The Company further agrees to take all steps
necessary to cause

        

the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of
shares of Company Capital Stock, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws. The Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Sub, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by Law. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of the shares of Company Capital Stock, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Sub shall be
given the opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any
amendment thereto before filing with the SEC. In addition, the Company
agrees to provide Parent and Sub any comments, whether written or oral, that
the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of
such comments, and to consult with Parent, Sub and their counsel prior to
responding to any such comments, either in written or oral form.

  

### (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or
cause to be furnished to Parent or Sub mailing labels, security position
listings and all available listings and computer files containing the names
and addresses of the record holders of the shares of Company Capital Stock as
of a recent date, and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to
such date, and shall promptly furnish Parent or Sub with such information and
assistance (including, but not limited to, lists of holders of the shares of
Company Capital Stock, updated periodically, and their addresses, mailing
labels and lists of security positions) as Parent or Sub or its agent(s) may
reasonably request. Subject to applicable Law, such information shall be held
confidential by Parent and Sub under the terms of the confidentiality
agreement, dated April 27, 2007 entered into between Parent and the Company
(as amended, the "Confidentiality Agreement"). For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties agree that the Confidentiality Agreement does not restrict steps to
prepare, file or disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby

  

## 1.3 _The Merger_.

  

### (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.4), the Company and Sub shall
consummate a merger (the "Merger") in accordance with the DGCL pursuant to
which (i) Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate
corporate existence of Sub shall thereupon cease; (ii) the Company shall be
the successor or surviving corporation in the Merger and shall continue to be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware; (iii) the separate corporate
existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger; and (iv) the Company
shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub. The
corporation surviving the Merger is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation." The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Company and Sub shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

        

### (b) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
be amended and restated at the Effective Time to read in the form of Annex
III, and as so amended, such Certificate of Incorporation shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

### (c) The By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated at the Effective Time to read in the form of Annex IV, and as so

Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such By-Laws.

  

1.4 _Effective Time_. Parent, Sub and the Company shall cause an appropriate
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed and filed
on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.5) (or on such other date as
Parent and the Company may agree) with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on the
time and date on which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later time and date
as is specified in the Certificate of Merger, such time hereinafter referred
to as the "Effective Time."

  

1.5 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at
9:00 a.m. (Boston time) on a date to be specified by the parties, such date

Closing (the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Ropes and Gray, LLP, One
International Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, unless another date or
place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

  

1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.  The directors of
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the
officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after

each case until their respective successors shall have been duly elected,
designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Surviving Corporations Certificate of Incorporation
and By-Laws.

  

1.7 _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be
advised, that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the
Company or Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance,
assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
each such corporation or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may
be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right,
title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

        



  

## 1.8 _Stockholders  Meeting_.

  

### (a) If required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, the
Company, acting through the Company Board of Directors, shall, in accordance
with applicable Law and the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-
laws, shall:

  

#### (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
stockholders to consider the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger (the "Special Meeting") as soon as reasonably
practicable following the acceptance for payment and purchase of shares of
Company Capital Stock by Sub pursuant to the Offer for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement;

  

#### (ii) prepare and file with the SEC under the Exchange Act a preliminary
proxy or information statement relating to the Merger and this Agreement and
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and furnish the information
required to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement (as hereinafter
defined) and, after Parent shall have had a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Proxy Statement, respond promptly to any comments made by
the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy or information statement and
cause a definitive proxy or information statement (in either case, the "Proxy
Statement") to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable;

  

#### (iii) include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Company
Board of Directors that stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the
approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement; and

  

#### (iv) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from holders of shares
of Company Capital Stock proxies in favor of the Merger and take all other
action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the approval of
stockholders required by the DGCL and any other applicable Law and the
Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws (if applicable) to effect
the Merger.

  

### (b) Parent agrees to vote, or cause to be voted, all of the shares of
Company Capital Stock then beneficially owned by it, Sub or any of its other
subsidiaries in favor of the approval of the Merger and the adoption of this
Agreement.

  

1.9 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_.  Notwithstanding Section 1.8,
in the event that Parent, Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent shall acquire
at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of each class of
capital stock of the Company entitled to vote on the Merger, pursuant to the
Offer or otherwise, the parties hereto agree, at the request of Parent and
subject to Section 7, to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause
the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition,
without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with and
subject to the DGCL.

  

## 1.10 _Top-Up Option_.

  

### (a) The Company hereby grants to Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up
Option"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Section 1.10, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer
Price paid in the Offer up to that number of newly issued

        

shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the lowest
number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by the Parent or
the Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one
share more than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares (determined
on a "fully diluted basis" (which assumes conversion or exercise of all
derivative securities regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the
vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof)); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number
of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the shares of Company Common
Stock authorized and unissued at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option
and (ii) the Top-Up Option may not be exercised unless, following the time of
acceptance by the Sub of shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer
or after a subsequent offering period, eighty-five percent (85%) or more of
the shares of Company Common Stock shall be directly or indirectly owned by
the Parent or the Sub.  The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable once at any
time following the Acceptance Date and prior to the earlier to occur of (a)
the Effective Time and (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms.

  

### (b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery
of the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Laws, including compliance
with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the
Securities Act. If Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Sub shall give
the Company one business day prior written notice, specifying (i) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by the Parent
at the time of such notice and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of
such purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of
such notice, deliver written notice to Sub specifying, based on the
information provided by Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares.  At
the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the purchase price owed by Sub
to the Company therefor shall be paid to the Company (i) in cash, by wire
transfer or cashiers check or (ii) by issuance by Sub to the Company of a
promissory note on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

  

# SECTION 2- CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

  

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any shares of
Company Capital Stock or any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Sub ("Sub Common Stock"):

  

### (a) _Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Sub Common
Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._  All shares
of Company Capital Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and
any shares of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent or Sub shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be payable in exchange therefor.

  

### (c) _Conversion of Shares of Company Capital Stock_.  (i) Each issued
and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company
Common Stock to

        

be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than Dissenting
Shares (as defined in Section 2.3(a))) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price, payable to the holder thereof in cash, without
interest and (ii) each issued and outstanding share of Company Preferred
Stock (other than shares of Company Preferred Stock to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive the product of (x) two (2) multiplied
by (y) the Offer Price payable to the holder thereof in cash, without
interest (collectively the "Merger Consideration").  From and after the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Capital Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of
Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor, without
interest thereon, upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with
Section 2.2.

  

## 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

### (a) _Paying Agent_. Parent shall designate American Stock Transfer and
Trust Company or another bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as agent for the holders of shares of Company Capital
Stock in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") and to receive the
funds to which holders of shares of Company Capital Stock shall become
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c). Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent on a timely basis, on or prior to
the Effective Time and as and when needed after the Effective Time, cash
necessary to pay for the shares of Company Capital Stock converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). If for any reason the Exchange Fund is
inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company Capital
Stock shall be entitled under Section 2.1(c), Parent shall promptly deposit
or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit additional cash with
the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments of Merger Consideration, and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment
thereof. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent.

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates,
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Capital Stock (the "Certificates"), whose shares were converted
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify); and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed
and properly completed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of
Company Capital Stock, formerly represented by such Certificate and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by

        

this Section 2.2, without interest thereon, and shall not evidence any
interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a stockholder or other
equity holder of, the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

  

### (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of Company
Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
evidencing ownership of shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Section 2.

  

### (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following
six (6) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying
Agent and not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to
the Paying Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of
Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If Certificates
are not surrendered prior to two (2) years after the Effective Time,
unclaimed Merger Consideration payable with respect to such shares of Company
Capital Stock shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  

### (e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto.

  

## 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_.

  

### (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal. From and after
the Effective Time, a stockholder who has properly exercised such appraisal
rights shall not have any rights of a stockholder of the

        

Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such shares of Company
Capital Stock, except those provided under Section 262 of the DGCL. A holder
of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such shares of Company Capital Stock held by him, her or it in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after the Effective Time,
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his, her or its right to
appraisal, in which case such shares of Company Capital Stock shall be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or
Certificates, pursuant to Section 2.2.

  

### (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments received by the Company relating to rights of appraisal; and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in the conduct of all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal.  Except with the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for appraisal.

  

2.4 _Company Option Plan_. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to
ensure that at the Effective Time, each outstanding stock option, stock
equivalent right or right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (a
"Company Option" or "Company Options") granted under the Companys 2003 Stock
Incentive Plan (the "Option Plan"), without regard to the extent then vested
and exercisable shall be cancelled and, in consideration of
such cancellation, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, promptly, and in no event later than thirty (30) days following the
Acceptance Date, pay to such holders of Company Options, an amount in respect
thereof equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price
over the exercise price of each such Company Option multiplied by (y) the
number of unexercised shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto (such
payment, if any, to be net of applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section
2.7). As of the Effective Time, the Option Plan shall terminate and all
rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (as defined in Section
3.4(a)) shall be cancelled.  The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to
effectuate the foregoing, including, but not limited to, sending out the
requisite notices and obtaining all consents necessary to cash out and cancel
all Company Options necessary to ensure that, after the Effective Time, no
person shall have any right under the Option Plan, except as set forth
herein.

  

2.5 _Company Warrants_. Promptly after the commencement of the Offer, the
Company shall deliver to each holder of a warrant to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Company Warrants") any notice regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, as contemplated by
the Company Warrants.  The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain
all consents necessary to cash out at an amount in respect thereof equal to
the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise
price of each such Company Warrant multiplied by (y) the number of
unexercised shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto (such payment, if
any, to be net of applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.7) and
cancel all Company Warrants necessary to ensure that, after the Effective
Time, no person shall have any right under any Company Warrant, except as set
forth herein.

   

10  

   



  

2.6 _Section 16_. The Company Board shall, to the extent necessary, take
appropriate action, prior to or as of the Effective Time, to approve, for
purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act the disposition and
cancellation of the Company Options, the disposition and cancellation of the
Company Warrants and the sale of shares of Company Capital Stock, in each
case, in the Merger.  Provided that the Company shall first provide to Parent
the names of its stockholders and the number of shares of Company Capital
Stock or Company Options which may be subject to Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act and any other information reasonably requested by Parent and
relating to the same, the board of directors of Parent shall, prior to the
Effective Time, with respect to any executive officer of the Company
reasonably expected to become an executive officer of Parent, take
appropriate action to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act, any deemed grant of options to purchase Parent Common Stock under the
Company Options (as assumed pursuant hereto).

  

2.7 _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Company (in the case of the Company
Warrants), and Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from any amounts
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of shares of Company Capital Stock, Company Options or Company
Warrants such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any
provision of Tax (as defined in Section 3.15) law. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.

  

2.8 _Transfer Taxes_. If any payment pursuant to the Offer or the Merger is
to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the issuance to
a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has
been paid or is not applicable.

  

# SECTION 3 - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

  

Except as set forth on the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent on the date hereof, attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule"), which schedule shall identify any exceptions to the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement (the
section numbers of which are numbered to correspond to the section numbers of
this Agreement to which they refer; provided that an item disclosed in any
Section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
have been disclosed for each other Section or subsection of this Agreement
and the Company Disclosure Schedule to the extent the relevance is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure), the Company hereby makes the
following representations and warranties to, and agreements with, Parent and
Sub:

  

## 3.1 _Organization and Qualification_.

  

### (a) Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is a corporation or
other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its

        

jurisdiction of organization and has corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its assets and to carry on its business as now
being and as heretofore conducted. Each of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary is qualified or otherwise authorized to transact business
as a foreign corporation or other organization in all jurisdictions in which
such qualification or authorization is required by Law, except for
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or authorized and in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall mean a material
adverse effect on the assets, properties, business, results of operations or
financial condition of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; _provided,_ that in no event shall effects primarily resulting from
any of the following be taken into account in determining whether there is,
has been or is reasonably likely to be a "Company Material Adverse Effect":
(i) the economy or securities markets of the United States or any other
region outside of the United States in general, (ii) changes in general
legal, regulatory, political, economic or business conditions affecting
industries in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary conduct business,
generally, in each case, without a disproportionate impact on the Company and
such Company Subsidiary, (iii) the announcement, pendency, consummation of or
compliance with the transactions contemplated hereby or the terms and
conditions of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, (iv) any change in the
stock price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock in and of itself,
provided that such exclusion shall not apply to any underlying fact, event or
circumstance that may have caused or contributed to such change in stock
price or trading volume, (v) any failure by the Company to meet published
revenue or earnings projections, in and of itself, provided that such
exclusion shall not apply to any underlying fact, event or circumstance that
may have caused or contributed to such change in published revenue or
earnings projections, (vi) any act of terrorism or war not specifically
directed at the Company or any Company Subsidiary and without a
disproportionate impact on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (vii)
any change to generally accepted accounting principles or regulations or the
official interpretations thereof that generally affect industries in which
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries conduct business, (viii) any change
in Laws not specifically directed at the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
(ix) the termination by employees of their employment with the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or (x) the identity of Parent, Sub or any of their
affiliates, in each case, as the acquirer (whether directly or indirectly) of
the Company.

  

### (b) The Company has previously provided to Parent true and complete
copies of the charter and By-Laws or other organizational documents of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary as presently in effect, and none of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is in default in the performance,
observation or fulfillment of such documents, except, in the case of Company
Subsidiaries, such defaults that, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

3.2 _Authority to Execute and Perform Agreement_.  The Company has the
corporate power and authority to enter into, execute and deliver this
Agreement and, subject, in the case of consummation of the Merger, to the
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Company Capital Stock, to
perform fully its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by the Company Board of Directors.  No other action on
the part of the Company is necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than adoption of this

        

Agreement by the holders of Company Capital Stock). This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except to the extent enforceability may be limited by the effect of
applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and the effect of
general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity.

  

## 3.3 _Capitalization_.

  

### (a) The Company is authorized to issue 70,000,000 shares of Company
Common Stock, of which 55,035,739 shares were issued and outstanding as of

the Rights Agreement, dated as of November 17, 2004, between the Company and
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as rights agent (the "Company Rights

### (g) The Companys authorized capital stock consists solely of the Company
Common Stock described in Section 3.3(a) and the Company Preferred Stock
described in Section 3.3(e). There are not as of the date hereof, and at the
Effective Time there will not be, authorized or outstanding any
subscriptions, options, conversion or exchange rights, warrants, repurchase
or redemption agreements, or other agreements, claims or commitments of any
nature whatsoever obligating the Company to issue, transfer, deliver or sell,
or cause to be issued, transferred, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed,
additional shares of the capital stock or other securities of the Company or
obligating the Company to grant, extend or enter into any such agreement,
other than Company Options listed in Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and Company Warrants listed in Section 3.3(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no
stockholder agreements, voting trusts, proxies or other agreements,
instruments or understandings with respect to the voting of the capital stock
of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, "knowledge of the Company"
and words of similar import shall mean the actual knowledge, after reasonable
inquiry of the employees of the Company who are primarily responsible for the
matter(s) in question, of the individuals listed in Section 3.3(g) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

### (h) The Company has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other

## 3.4 _Company Subsidiaries_.

  

### (a) Section 3.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of the names, jurisdictions of organization and
capitalization of each Company Subsidiary and, for the Company and each
Company Subsidiary, the jurisdictions in which it is qualified to do
business.  Section 3.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule also sets forth
for each such subsidiary the individuals who comprise the board of directors
or comparable body for each such entity.  The Company agrees to take, or
cause to be taken, the actions necessary so that those individuals will
resign and be replaced by individuals specified by Parent effective as of the
Effective Time.  All issued and outstanding shares or other equity interests
of each Company Subsidiary are owned directly by the Company free and clear
of any charges, liens, encumbrances, security interests or adverse claims. As
used in this Agreement, "Company Subsidiary" means any corporation,
partnership or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of
which (i) the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a general partner or (ii)
at least 50% of the securities or other interests having voting power to
elect a majority of the

        

board of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to
such corporation, partnership or other organization are directly or
indirectly owned or controlled by the Company or by any Company Subsidiary,
or by the Company and one or more Company Subsidiary.

  

### (b) There are not as of the date hereof, and at the Effective Time there
will not be, any subscriptions, options, conversion or exchange rights,
warrants, repurchase or redemption agreements, or other agreements, claims or
commitments of any nature whatsoever obligating any Company Subsidiary to
issue, transfer, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, transferred,
delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, shares of the capital stock or
other securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or obligating the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any such
agreement.  To the knowledge of the Company, there are no stockholder
agreements, voting trusts, proxies or other agreements, instruments or
understandings with respect to the voting of the capital stock of any Company
Subsidiary.

  

### (c) Section 3.4(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, for
each Company Joint Venture, the interest held by the Company and the
jurisdiction in which such Company Joint Venture is organized.  Interests in
Company Joint Ventures held by the Company are held directly by the Company,
free and clear of any charges, liens, encumbrances, security interests or
adverse claims. The term "Company Joint Venture" means any corporation or
other entity (including partnership, limited liability company and other
business association) that is not a Company Subsidiary and in which the
Company or one or more Company Subsidiaries owns an equity interest (other
than equity interests held for passive investment purposes which are less
than 5% of any class of the outstanding voting securities or other equity of
any such entity).

  

3.5 _SEC Reports_. The Company previously has made available to Parent (i)
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2006 (the "Company
10-K"), as filed with the SEC, (ii) all proxy statements relating to the
Companys meetings of stockholders held or to be held after June 30, 2006 and
(iii) all other documents filed by the Company with, or furnished by the
Company to, the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act since June 30, 2003 and
prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Company SEC Reports"). As of their
respective dates, such documents complied, and all documents filed by the
Company with the SEC between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date
shall comply, in all material respects, with applicable SEC requirements and
did not, or in the case of documents filed on or after the date hereof will
not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The parties agree that failure of the Companys chief
executive officer or chief financial officer to provide an
unqualified certification in any certification required to be filed with any
document filed with the SEC shall constitute an event that has a Company
Material Adverse Effect. On and since June 30, 2006, the Company has timely
filed, and between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date shall
timely file, with the SEC all documents required to be filed by it under the
Exchange Act. No Company Subsidiary is required to file any form, report or
other document with the SEC.

        

3.6 _Financial Statements_.

  

### (a) The consolidated financial statements contained in the Company 10-K
and in the Companys quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended
December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2007 (collectively, the "Company 10-Qs") have
been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of the
Company and present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of and for the periods presented therein, all in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis,
except as otherwise indicated therein and subject in the case of the
unaudited financial statements included in the Company 10-Qs to normal year-
end adjustments, which in the aggregate are not material, and the absence of
notes in the unaudited financial statements.

  

### (b) The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed
in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations; (ii)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization; and (iii) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences.  The management of the
Company has designated and implemented disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), or caused
such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed and implemented under
their supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
Company is made known to the management of the Company by others within the
Company. Since the date of the filing of the Companys most recent quarterly
report on Form 10-Q prior to the date hereof, the Companys outside auditors
and the audit committee of the Company Board have not been advised of (A) any
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting which adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. Any material change in internal
control over financial reporting and any significant deficiency or material
weakness in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting required to be disclosed in any SEC Report or in any
form, report or document filed by the Company with the SEC has been so
disclosed and each significant deficiency and material weakness previously so
disclosed have been remediated.

  

### (c) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 promulgated under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to
the SEC Reports and with respect to any form, report or document filed by the
Company with the SEC after the date hereof. For purposes of the
immediately preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  

### (d) The Company is not a party to, or does not have any commitment to
become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar contract

        

(including any contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Company, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off-
balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under
the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such
contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company in the Companys published
financial statements or other Company SEC Reports.

  

### (e) Section 3.6(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each
"open tax position" as such term is used in FIN 48.

  

3.7 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. As of June 30, 2006, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries had no material liabilities of any nature,
whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise (including without
limitation, liabilities as guarantor or otherwise with respect to obligations
of others or liabilities for Taxes due or then accrued or to become due),
required to be reflected or disclosed in the balance sheet dated June 30,
2006 (or the notes thereto) included in the Company 10-K (the
"Company Balance Sheet") that were not adequately reflected or reserved
against on the Company Balance Sheet. The Company has no material
liabilities of any nature, whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise, other than liabilities (i) adequately reflected or reserved
against on the Company Balance Sheet, (ii) reflected in the Companys
unaudited balance sheet dated March 31, 2007, included in the Form 10-Q filed
by the Company for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, (iii) included in
Section 3.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or (iv) incurred since March
31, 2007 in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice.

  

## 3.8 _Absence of Adverse Changes_.

  

### (a) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports, since June 30, 2006,
there has not been any change, event or circumstance that has had, or is

right to use all patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade
secrets, copyrights and all other intellectual property (including, without
limitation, biological materials), all registrations of any of the foregoing,
or applications therefor, and all grants and licenses or other rights running
to or from the Company or a Company Subsidiary as described under the heading
"Legal Proceedings" in the Company SEC Reports, that are material to their
businesses as presently conducted or as contemplated to be conducted
(collectively, the "Proprietary Rights"). To the knowledge of the Company,
the issued patents, registered trademarks and registered copyrights referred
to above are subsisting and in full force and effect. With respect to patents,
registered trademarks and registered copyrights owned by the Company, the
Company has taken all steps necessary to maintain registrations thereof,
including by payment when due of all maintenance fees and annuities and the
filing of all necessary renewals, statements and certifications. Assignment
documents have been executed and filed with relevant Governmental Entities as
necessary to transfer to the Company or a Company Subsidiary title to any of
the Companys owned Proprietary Rights previously owned by a third party and
to record such transfer. The named inventors of each of the Companys owned
patent applications have assigned the Companys owned patent applications to
the Company, and the named inventors of each of the Companys licensed patent
applications have assigned the Companys licensed patent applications
to Stegram Pharmaceuticals Ltd. or University College London, as applicable.
On the expiration date of the Offer, the Company shall provide Parent with a
schedule of any Taxes, maintenance fees or actions falling due within 90 days
of such expiration with respect to such patents, trademarks and copyrights.
To the Companys knowledge, the Company is not aware of any reasonable basis
for any claim by any third party that the businesses of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, nor, to
the Companys knowledge, has the Company or any Company Subsidiary received
any charge, complaint, claim, demand, or notice alleging any
interference, infringement, misappropriation, or conflict (including any
claim that the Company, a Company Subsidiary or any of their affiliates must
license or refrain from using any intellectual property rights). To the
Companys knowledge, no third party has infringed upon any of the Proprietary
Rights, or asserted any competing claim of right to use or own any

        

### of, the Proprietary Rights.  Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule identifies (i) all issued patents and registered trademarks that
have been issued to the Company or a Company Subsidiary, (ii) each pending
application therefor submitted by the Company or a Company Subsidiary and
(iii) all issued patents, registered trademarks and pending applications
therefor owned by a third party who has granted the Company or a Company
Subsidiary exclusive rights thereto. To the knowledge of the Company,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have the right to sell their
products and services (whether now offered for sale or under development)
free from any royalty or other obligations to third parties.  Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has agreed to, or has an obligation to,
indemnify any third party for or against any interference, infringement,
misappropriation or other conflict with respect to Proprietary Rights. To the
knowledge of the Company, none of the activities of the employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary on behalf of such entity violates any
agreement or arrangement which any such employees have with former employers.
 To the knowledge of the Company, all employees and consultants
who contributed to the discovery or development of any of the subject matter
of the Companys owned patent applications did so either (x) within the scope
of their employment such that, in accordance with applicable Law, all rights
to such developed subject matter became the exclusive property of the Company
or the Company Subsidiary or (y) pursuant to written agreements assigning all
rights to such developed subject matter to the Company or a Company
Subsidiary. Assignment documents assigning to Company all rights of such
employees, contractors and consultants have been duly filed in all relevant
patent offices worldwide for all patent applications and patents owned in
whole or in part by Company. To the knowledge of the Company, each employee,
contractor or consultant of the Company who has proprietary knowledge of or
information relating to the manufacturing processes, or the formulation of
the products, of the Company or a Company Subsidiary has executed and
delivered to the Company an agreement or agreements restricting such persons
right to use and disclose confidential information of the Company. Except as
would not unreasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
there are no settlements, forbearances to sue, consents, judgments, or orders
or similar obligations to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
party that: (i) restrict any Proprietary Rights; (ii) restrict the conduct of
the business of the Company or any of its employees; or (iii) grant third
parties any material rights under Proprietary Rights. To the knowledge of the
Company and except as would not unreasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, no material trade secret of the Company has been
disclosed or authorized to be disclosed to any third party in violation of
confidentiality obligations to the Company and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no party to a nondisclosure agreement with the Company is in breach
or default thereof. To the knowledge of the Company, no current or former
director, officer, consultant or employee of the Company will, after giving
effect to the Offer and the Merger, own any of the Proprietary Rights. To the
knowledge of the Company and except as would not unreasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the execution of, the delivery of,
the consummation of the Offer and Merger contemplated by, and the performance
of the Companys obligations under, this Agreement will not result in any
loss or impairment of any Proprietary Rights. To the knowledge of the
Company, neither government funding nor government, academic or non-profit
research facilities were used in the development of any of the patent
applications owned by the Company.

  

### (b) With respect to property other than Proprietary Rights, the Company
and each Company Subsidiary has all assets, properties, rights and contracts
necessary to permit the

        

### Company and the Company Subsidiaries to conduct their business as it
is currently being conducted, except where the failure to have such
assets, properties, rights and contracts would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary has good, clear and marketable title to all of its properties,
interests in properties and assets, real and personal, reflected in the
Company Balance Sheet (except properties, interests in properties and assets
sold or otherwise disposed of since the June 30, 2006 in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice), or with respect to leased
properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in such properties and
assets, in each case, free and clear of all imperfections of
title, restrictions, encroachments, liens and easements, except (i) liens for
current Taxes not yet due and payable, that are payable without penalty or
that are being contested in good faith, (ii) such imperfections of title,
restrictions, encroachments, liens and easements as do not and could not
reasonably be expected to materially detract from or interfere with the use
or value of the properties subject thereto or affected thereby, or otherwise
materially impair business operations involving such properties and (iii)
liens securing debt which are reflected on the Company Balance Sheet. There
are no written or oral subleases, licenses, occupancy agreements or other
contractual obligations that grant the right of use or occupancy of any real
property leased by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (collectively, the
"Real Property"), and there is no person in possession of the Real Property
other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. There is no pending, or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened eminent domain, condemnation or
similar proceeding affecting any Real Property leased by the Company or a
Company Subsidiary. To the knowledge of the Company, the property and
equipment of the Company and each Company Subsidiary that are used in
the operations of business are (i) in good operating condition and repair and
(ii) have been maintained in accordance with normal industry practices.
Section 3.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Real Property
leased by the Company or a Company Subsidiary, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary owns any Real Property.

  

3.13 _Insurance_. All policies or binders of material fire, liability,
product liability, workers compensation, vehicular, directors and officers
and other material insurance held by or on behalf of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries are in full force and effect in all material
respects, are reasonably adequate for the businesses engaged in by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and are in conformity in all material
respects with the requirements of all leases or other agreements to which the
Company or the relevant Company Subsidiary is a party and, to the knowledge
of the Company, are valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in default in any material
respect with respect to any provision contained in such policy or binder nor
has any of the Company or a Company Subsidiary failed to give any notice or
present any material claim under any such policy or binder in due and timely
fashion. All premiums for each policy or binder have been paid for the
current period, and there are no outstanding premium finance payments due for
such period. There are no material outstanding unpaid claims under any such
policy or binder. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received
notice of cancellation or non-renewal of any such policy or binder.  All
applications for the Companys currently effective directors and officers
insurance were true, correct and complete in all material respects when
submitted to the carrier. There are no gaps in insurance coverage for the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, no coverage limits of insurance policies
covering the Company or a Company Subsidiary have been exhausted and to the
Companys knowledge, all of the insurers of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary remain solvent and able to pay claims.

        



  

3.14 _Commercial Relationships_. None of the Companys or the Company
Subsidiaries material suppliers, collaborators, distributors, licensors or
licensees has canceled or otherwise terminated its relationship with the
Company or a Company Subsidiary or has, during the last twelve
months, materially altered its relationship with the Company or a
Company Subsidiary. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no plan or
intention of any such entity, and the Company has not received any threat or
notice from any such entity, to terminate, cancel or otherwise materially
modify its relationship with the Company or a Company Subsidiary. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company is in compliance in all
material respects with diligence obligations, and has not failed to achieve
any development milestones within applicable time periods, under material
license agreements.

the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for vested benefits accrued
through the date of termination and the administrative and professional costs
incurred in such transaction. Except as listed in Section 3.16(j) of

### (a) Each of the Company and its Representatives (as defined below) has
ceased and caused to be terminated all existing solicitations, initiations,
encouragements, discussions, negotiations and communications with any persons
or entities with respect to any offer or proposal or potential offer or
proposal relating to any transaction or proposed transaction or series of
related transactions, other than the transactions contemplated hereby,
involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase from the Company by any person or
"group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder) of more than a twenty percent (20%) interest in the
Company Common Stock or the Company Convertible Preferred Stock or any of
voting securities of the Company Subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any person or "group" (as defined
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder) beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the total
outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B)
any consolidation, business combination, merger or similar transaction
involving the Company; (C) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license,

or more of the market value of all of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock on the last trading day prior to the date of this Agreement; or
(D) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation or dissolution of the
Company (each of clauses (A)-(D), an "Acquisition Proposal"). Except as
provided in Section 5.2(b) or (c), from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, the Company
shall not and shall not authorize or permit its officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other agents or
those of its subsidiaries (collectively,

        

### "Representatives") to directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit
or knowingly encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making of, any
offer or proposal which constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to
any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) engage in negotiations or discussions
with, or provide any information or data to, any person (other than Parent or
any of its affiliates or representatives) relating to any Acquisition
Proposal or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or other
agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section
5.2 or any other provision hereof shall prohibit the Company or the Company
Board of Directors from (x) taking and disclosing to the Companys
stockholders its position with respect to any tender or exchange offer by a
third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, or (y) making such disclosure to the Companys stockholders as in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board of Directors, after receipt
of advice from outside legal counsel, is required under applicable Law and
that the failure to make such disclosure would cause the Company Board of
Directors to violate its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law.

  

### (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the acceptance of shares of
Company Capital Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "Acceptance Date"), the
Company and its Representatives may furnish information concerning its
business, properties or assets to any person pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement and may negotiate and participate in
discussions and negotiations with such person concerning an Acquisition
Proposal if, but only if, such person has, in the absence of any violation of
this Section 5.2 by the Company, submitted a _bona fide_  written proposal to
the Company relating to any such Acquisition Proposal which the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor, is or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as
defined below). The Company shall promptly (and in any case within 24 hours)
notify Parent (i) of each such Superior Proposal, which notice shall include
a copy of such Superior Proposal and (ii) upon receipt of any inquiries,
proposals or offers received by, any request for information from, or any
discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, the
Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Representatives concerning an
Acquisition Proposal or that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal and disclose the identity of the other party and the
material terms of such inquiry, offer, proposal or request and, in the case
of written materials, provide copies of such materials and (iii) provide
Parent with copies of all written materials provided by the Company to such
party. The Company will keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis
(and, in any case, within 24 hours of any significant development) of the
status and details (including amendments and proposed amendments) of any such
Superior Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request. The Company
shall promptly, following a determination by the Company Board of Directors
that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify Parent of
such determination. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" is
an Acquisition Proposal for 100% of the outstanding Company Capital Stock
that involves consideration to the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock
that is superior to the consideration offered to such holders pursuant to the
Offer and the Merger and that otherwise represents a superior transaction to
the Offer and the Merger.

  

### (c) Except as set forth herein, neither the Company Board of Directors
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to Parent or Sub, the

        

### approval or recommendation by the Company Board of Directors or any such
committee of the Offer, this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve
or recommend or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal
(any action referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being referred
to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (iii) enter into any agreement
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company Board of Directors may (subject to
the terms of this and the following two sentences) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change at any time after (x) it has concluded in good faith,
after receipt of advice from outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders, (y) the third (3rd) business day following the Companys
delivery to Parent of written notice advising Parent that the Company Board
of Directors has received a Superior Proposal (which notice shall include a
copy of such Superior Proposal) and identify the Person making such Superior
Proposal and advising Parent that the Company intends to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change, and (z) during such three (3) business day period, the
Company has provided the Parent the opportunity to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Board of
Directors of Company to proceed with its recommendation of the Offer and
Merger to stockholders without making an Adverse Recommendation Change;
_provided, however,_  that any such adjustments shall be at the discretion of
Parent and Sub at such time. Any Adverse Recommendation Change shall not
change the approval of the Company Board of Directors for purposes of causing
any state takeover statute or other state Law to be inapplicable to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including each of the Offer
and the Merger or by the tender and voting Agreements with Principal
Shareholders.

  

### (d) The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than two (2)
business days after the date of this Agreement) demand that each individual
or entity that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with
potential Acquisition Proposal return (or destroy, to the extent permitted by
the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement) all confidential
information furnished to such individual or entity by or on behalf of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary.

  

5.3 _401(k)_. Except with the prior written consent of the Parent, during the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not (i) make any discretionary contribution to the Companys 401(k)
plan, other than employer matching contributions at the rate in effect
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, or (ii) make any required
contribution to the Companys 401(k) plan in Company Common Stock. If
requested by the Parent in writing, the Company shall terminate the Companys
401(k) plan immediately prior to the scheduled expiration date of the Offer.

  

# SECTION 6 - ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

6.1 _Proxy Statement_. If required by the Exchange Act, the Company shall,
as soon as practicable following the expiration of the Offer, prepare and
file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and each of the
Company, Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto.
The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall supply Parent with copies of all

        

correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of the adoption of this Agreement
by the required vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock (the "Company Shareholder Approval") there shall occur any event
that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders
such an amendment or supplement. The Company shall not mail any Proxy
Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, to which Parent reasonably
objects. The Company shall use its best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after
filing with the SEC. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Proxy Statement shall contain the recommendation of the Company Board of
Directors in favor of the Merger.

  

6.2 _Meeting of Stockholders of the Company_. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following the expiration of the Offer and the purchase of the
shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant thereto, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of seeking the
Company Shareholder Approval. The Company shall, through the Company Board of
Directors, recommend to its stockholders that they give the
Company Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sub or any
other subsidiary of Parent shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, the parties shall, at the request of Parent,
take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer without a
stockholders meeting in accordance with the DGCL.

  

6.3 _Access to Information_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall be
entitled, through its employees and representatives, to have such access to
the assets, properties, business and operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection
with Parents investigation of the Company with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Any such investigation and examination shall be
conducted at reasonable times during business hours upon reasonable
advance notice and under reasonable circumstances so as to minimize
disruption to or impairment of the Companys business and the Company shall
cooperate fully therein. No investigation by Parent shall diminish or
obviate any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of
the Company contained in this Agreement. In order that Parent may have
full opportunity to make such investigation, the Company shall furnish
the representatives of Parent during such period with all such information
and copies of such documents concerning the affairs of the Company as
such representatives may reasonably request and cause its officers,
employees, consultants, agents, accountants and attorneys to cooperate fully
with such representatives in connection with such investigation. The
information and documents so provided shall be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

6.4 _Public Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning the Offer and
the Merger shall be a joint press release and, thereafter, so long as this
Agreement is in effect, neither Parent, Sub nor the Company will disseminate
any press release or other announcement concerning the Merger, the Offer or
this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(other than a press release or other announcement that relates to a Superior
Proposal) to any third party, except as may be required by Law or by any
listing agreement with NASDAQ, without the prior consent of each of the other
parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably

        

withheld or delayed.  The parties have agreed to the text of the joint press
release announcing the execution of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, without prior consent of the other party, each party (a) may
communicate information that is not confidential to the other party with
financial analysts, investors and media representatives in a manner
consistent with its past practice in compliance with applicable Law and (b)
may disseminate material substantially similar to material included in
a press release or other document previously approved for external
distribution by the other parties. Each party agrees to promptly make
available to the other parties copies of any written communications made
without prior consultation with the other parties.

  

## 6.5 _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Efforts_.

  

### (a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent, Sub
and the Company shall make all filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, application or submission of other
documents required by any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
limitation: (i) Notification and Report Forms with the United States Federal
Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice ("DOJ") as required by the HSR Act, (ii) filings
required by the merger notification or control Laws of any applicable
jurisdiction, as agreed by the parties hereto, and (iv) any filings required
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable state or
securities or "blue sky" laws and the securities laws of any foreign country,
or any other applicable Laws or rules and regulations of any Governmental
Entity relating to the Offer and the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company
will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with any
Governmental Entity under this Section 6.5(a) to comply in all material
respects with all applicable Laws and rules and regulations of any
Governmental Entity.

  

### (b) Each of Parent, Sub, and the Company shall promptly supply the other
with any information which may be reasonably required in order to effectuate
any filings or application pursuant to Section 6.5(a).

  

### (c) Each of Parent, Sub and the Company will notify the others promptly
upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any officials of any Governmental
Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto and (ii) any
request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments
or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information provided to
comply in all material respects with, any applicable Laws and rules and
regulations of any Governmental Entity. Whenever any event occurs that is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made
pursuant to Section 6.5(a), Parent, Sub or the Company, as the case may be,
will promptly inform the others of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.

  

### (d) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including complying in all material
respects with all applicable Laws and with all rules

        

### and regulations of any Governmental Entity and using its reasonable best
efforts to accomplish the following:  (i) the causing of all the conditions
set forth in Section 7 and in Annex I hereto to be satisfied and to
consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the obtaining of all reasonably
requested actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals,
orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all
reasonably requested registrations, declarations and filings (including
registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any),
(iii) the obtaining of all reasonably requested consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties, (iv) the defending of any suits, claims,
actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or temporary
restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated
or reversed, and (v) the execution or delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and to carry
out fully the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, use all reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the proper officers and directors of the Company, Parent and Sub shall use
all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary
actions. Parent shall cause Sub to fulfill all Subs obligations under, and
pursuant to, this Agreement. The Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any consent, approval, or waiver with respect to the Select
Agreements such that no party will have a reasonable basis to maintain that
the representations and warranties in Section 3.11(a)(ii) are not true and
correct. Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other subsidiary of Parent to sell, hold separate, license
or otherwise dispose of any assets or conduct their business in a specified
manner, or agree or proffer to sell, hold separate, license or otherwise
dispose of any assets or conduct their business in a specified manner, or
permit or agree to the sale, holding separate, licensing or other disposition
of, any assets of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other subsidiary
of Parent or the Company, whether as a condition to obtaining any approval
from, or to avoid potential litigation or administrative action by, a
Governmental Entity or any other person or for any other reason. Until this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, Parent shall have the
right to participate in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding
instituted or threatened against the Company (or any of its directors or
officers) before any court or governmental or regulatory body, to restrain,
modify or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
or to seek damages or discovery in connection with such transactions.

  

6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each party shall give prompt notice
to the other parties of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which would cause any representation or
warranty made by such party in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the Effective Time,
(ii) any condition set forth in Annex I that is unsatisfied in any material
respect at any time from the date hereof to the date the Sub purchases shares
of Company Capital Stock pursuant to

        

the Offer (except to the extent it refers to a specific date), and (iii) any
material failure of such party or any of its representatives to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder; _provided, however,_ that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties, the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement or the remedies available to the party receiving such notification.

  

## 6.7 _Indemnification_.

  

### (a) Parent agrees that any rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing in favor of the directors or officers of the Company and the
directors or officers of each Company Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties"
and, each, an "Indemnified Party") as provided in their respective
organizational documents, in effect as of the date hereof, with respect to
matters occurring at or prior to the Acceptance Date shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years
after the Acceptance Date, and Parent guarantees any such obligations of the
Surviving Corporation.  During such period, Parent shall not, nor shall it
permit the Surviving Corporation to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions for indemnification in any manner that would materially and
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time on or
prior to the Acceptance Date were directors or officers of the Company or
directors or officers of any of Company Subsidiary in respect of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Acceptance Date (including, without
limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless such
modification is required by Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the event
any claim or claims are asserted or made either prior to the Acceptance Date
or within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of
any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such
claims.

  

### (b) At or prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall purchase an
extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors
and officers liability insurance coverages or insurance policies that
provide coverage similar to the coverage provided under the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance coverages or insurance
policies for the Companys directors and officers in a form acceptable to the
Company that shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six
(6) years following the Acceptance Date of not less than the existing
coverage and have other terms not materially less favorable to, the insured
Persons than the directors and officers liability insurance coverages or
insurance policies presently maintained by the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the aggregate cost of such endorsement (the "Premium Price")
shall not exceed $1.80 million, and in the event that the Premium Price is
insufficient for such coverage, the Company shall purchase the maximum amount
of coverage that is available for such amount; and provided, further,
however, that prior to purchasing any such endorsement with a Premium Price
equal or exceeding $1.35 million, the Company shall afford Parent the
opportunity to purchase a substitute policy with the same coverage limits and
substantially similar terms as in the endorsement proposed to be purchased by
the Company from a reputable insurance carrier with a substantially similar
credit rating as the insurance carrier from which the Company proposes to
purchase such policy.  Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation not to, take actions to cancel such endorsement or dishonor any
obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation thereunder.

   

46  

   

### 

  

### (c) The obligations under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this
Section 6.7 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 6.7 applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.7 and shall be entitled
to enforce the covenants contained herein).

  

### (d) In the event Parent, Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets, then, and in each such case, to the extent
necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

  

6.8 _Consents and Approvals_. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub will take
all reasonable actions necessary to (i) comply promptly with all legal
requirements which may be imposed on it with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) promptly cooperate with and
furnish information to each other in connection with any such requirements
imposed upon any of them or any of their subsidiaries in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) take and cause
its respective subsidiaries to, take all reasonable actions necessary to
obtain any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by,
any Governmental Entity or other public or private third party required to be
obtained or made by Parent, Sub the Company or any of their subsidiaries in
connection with the Offer or the Merger or the taking of any action
contemplated thereby or by this Agreement (collectively, the
"Requisite Approvals").

  

6.9 _Additional Agreements_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable, whether under applicable Laws and
regulations or otherwise, or to remove any injunctions or other impediments
or delays, legal or otherwise, to satisfy the conditions to the Offer and
make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and directors of the Company and Parent shall use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary actions.

  

## 6.10 _Directors_.

  

### (a) Promptly upon the first acceptance for payment of, and payment by Sub
for, any shares of Company Common Stock which represent at least a majority
of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (which assumes
the exercise or conversion of all vested options, rights and securities
exercisable or convertible into shares of such class) pursuant to the Offer,
Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors on the Company
Board of Directors as will give Parent, subject to compliance with Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act, representation on the Company Board of Directors
equal to at least that number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, which is the product of (x) the total number of directors on the
Company Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors elected pursuant
to this

        

### sentence) multiplied by (y) the percentage that (I) such number of shares
of Company Common Stock so accepted for payment and paid for by Sub plus the
number of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise owned by Parent, Sub
or any other subsidiary of Parent bears to (II) the number of such shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding, and the Company shall, at such time,
cause Parents designees to be so elected; _provided, however,_  that in the
event that Parents designees are appointed or elected to the Company Board
of Directors, until the Effective Time the Company Board of Directors shall
have at least three directors who are directors on the date of this Agreement
and who are not officers of the Company (the "Independent Directors"); and
_provided further_ that, in such event, if the number of Independent
Directors shall be reduced below three for any reason whatsoever, any
remaining Independent Directors (or Independent Director, if there shall be
only one remaining) shall be entitled to designate persons to fill such
vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of
this Agreement or, if no Independent Directors then remain, the other
directors shall designate three persons to fill such vacancies who are not
officers or affiliates of the Company, Parent or Sub, and such persons shall
be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. At such
time, the Company shall, upon Parents request, also cause persons elected or
designated by Parent to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the
next whole number) as is on the Company Board of Directors of (i) each
committee of the Company Board of Directors of Directors, (ii) each board of
directors (or similar body) of each of the Companys Subsidiaries, and (iii)
each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case only to the
extent permitted by applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange on
which the Company Common Stock is listed. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall take all action requested by Parent necessary to effect any
such election, including mailing to its stockholders the
Information Statement containing the information required by Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, and the Company shall
make such mailing with the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 (provided that Sub
shall have provided to the Company on a timely basis all information required
to be included in the Information Statement with respect to Subs designees).
In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall promptly, at the option
of Sub, either increase the size of the Company Board of Directors or obtain
the resignation of such number of its current directors, or both, as is
necessary to enable Subs designees to be elected or appointed to the Company
Board of Directors as provided above.

  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
Parents designees constitute a majority of the Company Board of Directors
after the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant
to the Offer and prior to the Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of a
majority of the Independent Directors (or if only one exists, then the vote
of such Independent Director) shall be required to (i) amend or terminate
this Agreement by the Company, (ii) exercise or waive any of the Companys
rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, if such action would materially and
adversely affect holders of shares of Company Capital Stock other than Parent
or Sub, (iii) amend the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the
Company, or (iv) take any other action of the Company Board of Directors
under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided, however,_ that if there shall be no Independent Directors
as a result of such persons deaths, disabilities or refusal to serve, then
such actions may be effected by majority vote of the entire Company Board of
Directors.

        



  

# SECTION 7 - CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE OBLIGATION OF PARTIES TO 
 CONSUMMATE THE MERGER

  

7.1 _Conditions to Obligations of Each Party to Effect the Merger_. The
respective obligations of each party to this Agreement to effect the Merger
shall be subject to the satisfaction or written waiver at or prior to the
Closing Date of the following conditions:

  

### (a) _Stockholder Approval_. The Merger and this Agreement shall have
been approved and adopted by the requisite vote of the holders of the shares
of Company Capital Stock, to the extent required pursuant to the requirements
of the certificate of incorporation and the DGCL.

  

### (b) _Statutes; Court Orders_. No statute, rule, executive order or
regulation shall have been enacted, issued, enforced or promulgated by any
Governmental Entity which prohibits the consummation of the Merger, and there

in effect preventing consummation of the Merger.

  

# SECTION 8 - TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

  

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time before the Effective Time,
whether before or after stockholder approval thereof:

  

### (a) By mutual written consent of Parent and the Company duly authorized
by the Board of Directors of the Parent and the Company Board of Directors;
or

  

### (b) By either Parent or the Company: (i) if a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree
or ruling or taken any other action, and such order, decree or ruling or
other action shall have become final and non-appealable, or there shall exist
any statute, rule or regulation, in each case, permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting (collectively, "Restraints") the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided,
however,_  that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall have used reasonable best efforts to prevent the
entry of and to remove such Restraints; or (ii) if the Merger has not been
consummated by December 31, 2007 (the "Termination Date"); _provided,
however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose action or
failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the principal
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such
date; or

  

### (c) By Parent if, prior to the purchase of shares of Company Capital
Stock pursuant to the Offer, there has been a breach by the Company of or
inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Company set forth in this Agreement, which breach or inaccuracy has resulted
in the conditions set forth in paragraphs (c) or (f) Annex I not being
satisfied (and such breach or inaccuracy has not been cured or such condition
has not been satisfied within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice
thereof or such breach or inaccuracy is not reasonably capable of being cured
or such condition is not reasonably capable of being satisfied within such
period); or (ii) due to an occurrence or circumstance that has resulted in a
failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Annex I hereto, Sub shall have
allowed

        

### the Offer to terminate, without having accepted any shares of
Company Capital Stock for payment thereunder, unless such occurrence or
circumstance shall have been caused by or resulted from the failure of Parent
or Sub to perform, in any material respect, any of their covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, or the material breach by Parent or
Sub of any of their representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement; or

  

### (d) By the Company if, prior to the purchase of shares of Company Capital
Stock pursuant to the Offer, there has been a breach by Parent or Sub of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein, or if
a representation or warranty of Parent or Sub shall have become untrue, which
situation in any case (i) would result in any of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Sub set forth in this Agreement not being true and
correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or
"material adverse effect" or similar terms set forth therein) except where
the failure to be so true and correct does not have, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, or would result in a failure by Parent or Sub to perform
in all material respects its obligations and covenants required to be
performed by it under this Agreement and (ii) has not been cured within 30
days following notice by the Company or, if the Termination Date is less than
60 days from the notice by the Company, has not been or cannot reasonably be
expected to be cured by the Termination Date; or

  

### (e) By Parent, at any time prior to the purchase of the shares of Company
Capital Stock pursuant to the Offer, if (i) the Company Board of Directors
shall have (A) effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) recommended to
the Companys stockholders any proposal other than by Parent or Sub in
respect of an Acquisition Proposal, or publicly announced its intention to
enter into any agreement in respect of any Acquisition Proposal, (C) failed
to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of this Agreement or the Offer within
two (2) business days of Parents request, or (D) failed to recommend
against, or taken a neutral position with respect to, a tender or exchange
offer related to an Acquisition Proposal in any position taken pursuant to
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act; or (ii) after receiving an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall have materially, knowingly and
intentionally violated or breached any of its obligations under Section 5.2
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or

  

### (f) At any time prior to the purchase of the shares of Company Capital
Stock pursuant to the Offer, by the Company, if the Company has received a
Superior Proposal, which, after giving effect to all of the adjustments that
may be offered by Parent pursuant to Section 5.2, the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors) continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, provided the Company
shall not have materially, knowingly and intentionally violated or breached
any of its obligations under Section 5.2 with respect to such Superior
Proposal.

  

## 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  

### (a) Any termination of this Agreement under Section 8.1 hereof will be
effective immediately upon the delivery of a written notice of the
terminating party to the other party hereto and, if then due, payment of the
Termination Fee. In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in
Section 8.1 hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and
be of no further force or effect and there shall be no liability on the part
of Parent, Sub

        

### or the Company (or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders, agents or representatives), except as set
forth in the last sentence of Section 6.3, Section 8 and Section 9, each of
which shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of
this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve
any party from liability for fraud or the knowing and intentional breach of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement.

  

### (b) If Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(e), the Company shall promptly pay Parent a termination fee (the
"Termination Fee") of $9 million. If the Company intends to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f), it shall, in connection with and as a
condition to such termination, pay Parent the Termination Fee. If Parent
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) due to a knowing and
intentional breach by the Company, and prior to such time an Acquisition
Proposal has been made, then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee
at the closing of a transaction relating to an Acquisition Proposal provided
such closing occurs within twelve (12) months after the termination date. If
Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), the
Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee promptly, but in no event
later than two (2) business days after the date of receipt of Parents
termination notice. All amounts due hereunder shall be payable by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to such account as Parent
may designate in writing to the Company. If the Company fails to promptly
make any payment required under this Section 8.2(b) and Parent commences a
suit to collect such payment, the Company shall indemnify Parent for its fees
and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection
with such suit and shall pay interest on the amount of the payment at the
prime rate of Bank of America (or its successors or assigns) in effect on the
date the payment was payable pursuant to this Section 8.2(b).

  

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in Section 8.2, all fees, costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses
whether or not the Merger is consummated. The Company will provide for the
transfer, on the Acceptance Date, to UBS Securities LLC, of a cash amount
sufficient to pay in full amounts due and payable to UBS Securities LLC in
connection with the Offer and the Merger.

  

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and as otherwise provided in the
Agreement, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any
and all respects, whether before or after any vote of the stockholders of the
Company contemplated hereby, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by
action taken by their respective Boards of Directors, but after the purchase
of shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the Offer, no amendment shall
be made which decreases the Merger Consideration and, after the approval of
this Agreement by the stockholders, no amendment shall be made which by Law
requires further approval by such stockholders without obtaining such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  

8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, either party hereto
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party hereto or (b) waive compliance with any of the
agreements of the other party or any conditions to its own obligations, in
each case only to the extent such obligations, agreements and conditions

        

are intended for its benefit; _provided,_  that any such extension or waiver
shall be binding upon a party only if such extension or waiver is set forth
in a writing executed by such party.

  

# SECTION 9 - MISCELLANEOUS

  

9.1 _No Survival_. None of the representations and warranties contained
herein shall survive the Effective Time.

  

9.2 _Notices_. Any notice or other communication required or permitted

Any party may by notice given in accordance with this Section 9.2 to the
other parties designate updated information of notices hereunder.

  

9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement contains the entire agreement among
the parties with respect to the Offer, the Merger and related transactions,
and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties with
respect thereto, other than the Confidentiality Agreement and the tender and
voting agreements with the Principal Shareholders.

  

9.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions arising under or in
connection therewith shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof, 
_provided, however,_ that the Laws of the respective jurisdictions of
incorporation of each of the parties shall govern the relative rights,
obligations, powers, duties and other internal affairs of such party and its
board of directors.

  

## 9.5 _Binding Effect; No Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

  

### (a) This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the parties hereto
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other parties, except that the Sub may assign, in its sole discretion
and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) to Parent and one or
more direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent, or (iii) to one
or more direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent (each, an
"Assignee"). Any such Assignee may thereafter assign, in its sole discretion
and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations hereunder to one or more additional Assignees;
_provided, however,_ that in connection with any assignment to an Assignee,
Parent and Sub (or the assignor) shall agree to remain liable for the
performance by Parent and Sub (and such assignor, if applicable) of their
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without
relieving any party hereto of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

        



  

### (b) Other than Section 6.7, which shall confer third party beneficiary
rights to the parties identified therein, nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person other than Parent,
Sub and the Company and their respective successors and permitted assigns any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

  

9.6 _Section Headings_. The headings of Sections in this Agreement are
provided for convenience only and shall not affect its construction or
interpretation. All references to "Section" or "Sections" refer to the
corresponding Section or Sections of this Agreement.

  

9.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  

9.8 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall remain
in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. The
parties further agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of
this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such
invalid or unenforceable provision.

  

9.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver_. Each of the Company, Parent and
Sub irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by the other party
hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought and determined in the
courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and each of the Company, Parent
and Sub hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any action or proceeding
for itself and in respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to
the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of the Company,
Parent and Sub hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other
than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court
is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or
proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

  

9.10 _Enforcement_. The parties recognize and agree that if for any reason
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable
harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that in addition to other
remedies the other party shall be entitled to an injunction without posting a
bond or other undertaking restraining any violation or threatened violation
of the provisions of this Agreement.

        

In the event that any action shall be brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of the Agreement, no party shall allege, and each party hereby
waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

  

## 9.11 _Rules of Construction; Certain Definitions_.

  

### (a) All words used in this Agreement shall be construed to be of such
gender or number as the circumstances require. Unless otherwise expressly
provided, the word "including" does not limit the preceding words or terms.
The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the
application of any law, regulation, holding or ruling of construction

 **Annex I**

  

 ** _Conditions to the Offer_**

  

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, and in addition to (and
not in limitation of) Subs rights to extend and amend the Offer at any time
in its sole discretion (subject to the provisions of the Merger Agreement),
Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange
Act (relating to Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of
Company Capital Stock promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer),
pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the
restriction referred to above, the payment for, any validly tendered shares
of Company Capital Stock if, there shall not have been validly tendered and
not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (1) that number of shares of
Company Common Stock which, when added to any shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent and Sub, represents a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (assuming, for purposes of such calculation,
the exercise or conversion of all vested "in the money" Company Options and
"in the money" Company Warrants) and (2) 100% of the outstanding shares of
Company Convertible Preferred Stock.  Furthermore, notwithstanding any other
provisions of the Offer, the Sub shall not be required to accept for payment
or pay for any validly tendered shares if, at the Expiration Date (i) any
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act have not expired or terminated
prior to the termination of the Offer; (ii) any clearances, permits,
authorizations, consents or approvals sought by Parent or Sub under any
applicable pre-merger notification laws or regulations of
foreign jurisdictions have not been obtained, or (iii) any of the following
events shall occur and be continuing:

  

### (a) there shall be pending any suit, action or proceeding (i) seeking to
prohibit or impose any material limitations on Parents or Subs ownership or
operation (or that of any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates) of
all or any material portion of their or the Companys or the Companys
Subsidiaries businesses or assets, taken as a whole, or to compel Parent or
Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates to dispose of or hold
separate any material portion of the business or assets of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) seeking to prohibit or make
illegal the making or consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the
performance of any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, (iii) seeking to impose material limitations on the ability of
Sub, or render Sub unable, to accept for payment, pay for or purchase some or
all of the shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the Offer or the
Merger, (iv) seeking to impose material limitations on the ability of Sub or
Parent effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of
Company Capital Stock, including, without limitation, the right to vote the
shares of Company Capital Stock purchased by it on all matters properly
presented to the Companys stockholders, or (v) seeking to
require divestiture by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates of any
shares of Company Capital Stock;

  

### (b) there shall be any statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or
injunction enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated or deemed applicable,
pursuant to an authoritative interpretation by or on behalf of a Government    

to the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby, or any
other action shall be taken by any Governmental Entity, that would reasonably
be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the consequences
referred to in clauses (i) through (v) of paragraph (a) above;

  

### (c) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
this Agreement shall not be true and correct (1) as of the date of this
Agreement except for representations and warranties that relate to a specific
date or time (which need only be true and correct in all material respects as
of such date or time) and (2) as of the Acceptance Date without giving effect
to any qualifications as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" except
for representations and warranties that relate to a specific date or time
(which need only be true and correct in all material respects as of such date
or time), except where the failure to be so true and correct, individually or
in the aggregate, does not have or would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

  

### (d) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any
events or changes which have had, or which are reasonably likely to have or
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect;

  

### (e) the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof shall have
(i) withdrawn, or modified or changed in a manner adverse to Parent or to Sub
(including by amendment of the Schedule 14D-9), its recommendation of the
Offer, the Merger Agreement, or the Merger or shall have failed to make such
favorable recommendation, (ii) approved or recommended to its stockholders
any Acquisition Proposal or entered into or publicly announced its intention
to enter into any agreement or agreement in principle with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) resolved or publicly proposed to do any of

days following receipt thereof) has elapsed for the Company Board of
Directors or any committee thereof to review and make a recommendation with
respect thereto;

  

### (f) the Company shall have breached or failed, in all material respects,
to perform or to comply with any agreement, obligation or covenant to be
performed or complied with by it under this Agreement and such failure to
perform or to comply shall not have been cured to the good faith satisfaction
of Parent and which breach or failure shall not have been cured by the
Company;

  

### (g) Sub shall have failed to receive a certificate executed by the
Companys Chief Executive Officer or President on behalf of the Company,
dated as of the scheduled expiration of the Offer, to the effect that the
conditions set forth in paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this Annex I have
not occurred;

  

### (h) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
its terms; or

  

### (i) there shall have occurred and be continuing (i) a declaration by a
Governmental Entity of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in
respect of banks in the United States or (ii) an extraordinary limitation
(whether or not mandatory) by any Governmental Entity on the extension of
credit generally by banks or other financial institutions,    

in each case, which prevents the Parent and Sub from effecting payment for
the shares of Company Capital Stock tendered in the Offer.

  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Sub, may be
asserted by Parent or Sub regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such
condition, and may be waived by Parent or Sub in whole or in part at any time
and from time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or Sub, subject in
each case to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The failure by Parent or Sub
at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any such right and, each such right shall be deemed an ongoing
right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

  

The capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is annexed, except that the term "Merger
Agreement" shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to which this Annex I is
annexed.  

  



  

 **Annex II**

  

 ** _TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENT_**

  

 **THIS TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENT**  (this "Agreement") dated May 29, 2007,
is entered into between GENZYME CORPORATION, a Massachusetts corporation
("Parent"), WICHITA BIO CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and
_________________________, ("Shareholder"), with respect to (i) the shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Company Common Stock"),
of Bioenvision, Inc. a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), (ii) the shares
of the Companys Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, $0.001
par value per share (the "Company Convertible Preferred Stock"), (iii)
all securities exchangeable, exercisable or convertible into Company Common
Stock or Company Convertible Preferred Stock, and (iv) any securities issued
or exchanged with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Convertible Preferred Stock, and upon any recapitalization,
reclassification, merger, consolidation, spin-off, partial or complete
liquidation, stock dividend, split-up or combination of the securities of the
Company or upon any other change in the Companys capital structure, in each
case whether now owned or hereafter acquired by the
Shareholder (collectively, the "Securities").

  

 ** _W I T N E S S E T H:_**

  

 **WHEREAS** , Parent, Sub and the Company have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger dated as of the date hereof (as the same may be amended or
supplemented, other than to lower the price to be paid in the Offer or
Merger, the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Sub has agreed to make a
cash tender offer described therein and thereafter merge with and into the
Company (the "Merger") with the result that the Company becomes a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent;

  

 **WHEREAS** , as of the date hereof, Shareholder beneficially owns and has
the power to dispose of the Securities set forth on Schedule I hereto and has
the power to vote the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Convertible
Preferred Stock set forth thereon;

  

 ** WHEREAS**, Parent and Sub desire to enter into this Agreement in
connection with their efforts to consummate the acquisition of the Company;
and

  

**WHEREAS** , capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined have
the meaning given to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

  

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in contemplation of the foregoing and in consideration
of the mutual agreements, covenants, representations and warranties contained
herein and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as    

##### 1. _Certain Covenants_.

  

###### 1.1 _Lock-Up_. Subject to Section 1.5, except as contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, Shareholder hereby covenants and agrees that between the
date hereof and the Termination Date, Shareholder will not (a) directly or
indirectly, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, tender, encumber or
otherwise dispose of or limit its right to vote in any manner any of the
Securities, or agree to do any of the foregoing, or (b) take any action which
would have the effect of preventing or disabling Shareholder from performing
its obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
connection with any transfer not involving or relating to any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), Shareholder may transfer any
or all of the Securities as follows: (i) in the case of a Shareholder that is
an entity, to any subsidiary, partner or member of Shareholder, and (ii) in
the case of an individual Shareholder, to Shareholders spouse, ancestors,
descendants or any trust for any of their benefits or to a charitable trust;
_provided, however,_ that in any such case, prior to and as a condition to
the effectiveness of such transfer, (x) each person to which any of such
Securities or any interest in any of such Securities is or may be transferred
(a) shall have executed and delivered to Parent and Sub a counterpart to this
Agreement pursuant to which such person shall be bound by all of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, and (b) shall have agreed in writing with
Parent and Sub to hold such Securities or interest in such Securities subject
to all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and (y) this Agreement
shall be the legal, valid and binding agreement of such person, enforceable
against such person in accordance with its terms.

  

###### 1.2 _No Solicitation_. Between the date hereof and the Termination
Date, except as otherwise permitted by Section 5.2 of the Merger Agreement,
neither the Shareholder nor any director, officer, agent, representative,
employee, affiliate or associate (collectively, "Representatives") of
Shareholder shall, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or encourage
the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or of any other sale, transfer,
pledge or other disposition or conversion of any of the Securities or of any
of the other debt or equity securities of the Company, or (b) participate in
or knowingly encourage any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any person any non-public information with respect to, enter into any
agreement with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or any other sale, transfer,
pledge or other disposition or conversion of any of the Securities or of any
of the other debt or equity securities of the Company, in any case, from, to
or with any person other than Parent or Sub. Shareholder will immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any such other parties conducted heretofore with respect to
any of the foregoing. Shareholder will notify Parent immediately if any
party contacts the Shareholder following the date hereof (other than Parent
and Sub) concerning any Acquisition Proposal or any other sale, transfer,
pledge or other disposition or conversion of any of the Securities or of any
of the other debt or equity securities of the Company.

  

###### 1.3 _Certain Events_. This Agreement and the obligations hereunder
will attach to the Securities and will be binding upon any person to which
legal or beneficial ownership of any or all of the Securities passes, whether
by operation of Law or otherwise, including without limitation, the
Stockholders successors or assigns. This Agreement and the obligations
hereunder will also attach to any additional shares of Company Common Stock    

Securities of the Company issued to or acquired by the Stockholder.

  

###### 1.4 _Grant of Proxy; Voting Agreement_.

  

(a) The Shareholder has revoked or terminated any proxies, voting agreements
or similar arrangements previously given or entered into with respect to the
Securities and hereby irrevocably appoints Parent as proxy for Shareholder to
vote the Securities for Shareholder and in Shareholders name, place and
stead, at any annual, special or other meeting or action of the shareholders
of the Company, as applicable, or at any adjournment thereof or pursuant to
any consent of the shareholders of the Company, in lieu of a meeting or
otherwise, whether before or after the closing of the Offer (as defined in
the Merger Agreement), for the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement
and the Merger. The parties acknowledge and agree that neither Parent, nor
Parents successors, assigns, subsidiaries, divisions, employees, officers,
directors, shareholders, agents and affiliates shall owe any duty to, whether
in law or otherwise, or incur any liability of any kind whatsoever, including
without limitation, with respect to any and all claims, losses, demands,
causes of action, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) and
compensation of any kind or nature whatsoever to the Shareholder in
connection with or as a result of any voting by Parent of the Securities
subject to the irrevocable proxy hereby granted to Parent at any annual,
special or other meeting or action or the execution of any consent of the
shareholders of the Company. The parties acknowledge that, pursuant to
the authority hereby granted under the irrevocable proxy, Parent may vote
the Securities in furtherance of its own interests, and Parent is not acting
as a fiduciary for the Shareholder.

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing grant to Parent of the irrevocable proxy,
if Parent elects not to exercise its rights to vote the Securities pursuant
to the irrevocable proxy, Shareholder agrees to vote the Securities during
the term of this Agreement in favor of or give its consent to, as applicable,
a proposal to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger as
described in Section 1.4(a) at any annual, special or other meeting or action
of the shareholders of the Company, in lieu of a meeting or otherwise.

  

(c) This irrevocable proxy shall not be terminated by any act of the
Shareholder or by operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of the
Shareholder or by the occurrence of any other event or events (including,
without limiting the foregoing, the termination of any trust or estate for
which Shareholder is acting as a fiduciary or fiduciaries or the dissolution
or liquidation of any corporation or partnership). If between the execution
hereof and the Termination Date, Shareholder should die or become
incapacitated, or if any trust or estate holding the Securities should be
terminated, or if any corporation or partnership holding the Securities
should be dissolved or liquidated, or if any other such similar event or
events shall occur before the Termination Date, certificates representing the
Securities shall be delivered by or on behalf of Shareholder in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and this Agreement, and
actions taken by the Parent hereunder shall be as valid as if such death,
incapacity, termination, dissolution, liquidation or other similar    

event or events had not occurred, regardless of whether or not the Parent has
received notice of such death, incapacity, termination, dissolution,
liquidation or other event.

  

###### 1.5 _Tender of Securities_. Shareholder agrees, in exchange for the
consideration described in the Merger Agreement, to tender the Securities to
Sub in the Offer as soon as practicable following the commencement of the
Offer, and in any event not later than five (5) business days following the
commencement of the Offer, and Shareholder shall not withdraw any Securities
so tendered unless the Offer is terminated.

  

###### 1.6 _Public Announcement_. Shareholder shall consult with Parent
before issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement without the approval of
Parent, except as may be required by Law, including any filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). This Section 1.6 shall
terminate and be null and void upon the earlier of (i) the Termination Date
and (ii) consummation of the Merger.

  

###### 1.7 _Disclosure_. Shareholder hereby authorizes Parent and Sub to
publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure required by the
SEC, Nasdaq or the American Stock Exchange or any other national securities
exchange and in the Offer Documents and, if necessary, the Proxy Statement
(each as defined in the Merger Agreement), (including all documents and
schedules filed with the SEC in connection with either of the foregoing), its
identity and ownership of the Securities and the nature of its commitments,
arrangements and understandings under this Agreement. Parent and Sub hereby
authorize Shareholder to make such disclosure or filings as may be required
by the SEC or the NASDAQ or any other national securities exchange.

  

###### 1.8 _Matters Pertaining to Company Convertible Preferred Stock_.
Reference is hereby made to that certain Certificate of Designations,
Preferences and Rights of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to the
Companys certificate of incorporation filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware on or about May 7, 2002 (as originally adopted and as
the same may have been or may be amended, modified, supplemented or restated
from time to time in accordance with its terms, the "Certificate of
Designations"). With respect to any shares of Company Convertible Preferred
Stock held (beneficially or of record) by the Shareholder, the Shareholder
hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees with the following solely in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement: (i) the Offering constitutes a Deemed Liquidation
(as defined in Section 5(c) of the Certificate of Designations) and such
Shareholder irrevocably waives the right to receive any amounts under Section
5(a) of the Certificate of Designations; (ii) such Shareholder waives such
Shareholders "opt out" right set forth in the second sentence of
Section 5(c) of the Certificate of Designations; (iii) such Shareholder
elects to receive the amounts payable with respect to such Shareholders
shares of Company Convertible Preferred Stock under the Merger Agreement (and
not the amounts described in clause (i) of the third sentence of Section 5(c)
of the Certificate of Designations); (iv) such Shareholder waives the right
to any notice under Section 5(d) of the Certificate of Designations; (v)
such Shareholder waives the rights provided to such Shareholder under Section
6 of the Certificate of Designations; and (vi) such Shareholder consents to    

Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement for all purposes under Section 9 of the Certificate of
Designations. The foregoing consents and waivers shall be irrevocable at all
times prior to the Termination Date.

  

##### 2. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_.  Shareholder
hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Sub, as of the date hereof and
as of the date Sub purchases shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the
Offer, that:

  

###### 2.1 _Ownership_. Shareholder has good and marketable title to, and is
the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Securities, in each case free and
clear of all liabilities, claims, liens, options, proxies,
charges, participations and encumbrances of any kind or character whatsoever,
other than those arising under the securities laws or under the Companys
governance documents or under any Registration Rights Agreement between the
Company and Shareholder (collectively, "Liens"). At the time Sub purchases
shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the Offer, Shareholder will
transfer and convey to Parent or its designee good and marketable title to
the shares of Company Capital Stock included in the Securities, free and
clear of all Liens created by or arising through Shareholder.

  

###### 2.2 _Authorization_. Shareholder has all requisite power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and has sole voting power and sole power of disposition,
with respect to the Securities with no restrictions on its voting rights or
rights of disposition pertaining thereto. Shareholder has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement and this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding
agreement of Shareholder, enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with
its terms. If the Shareholder is married and the Securities constitute
community property, this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Shareholders spouse, and this Agreement is a legal, valid
and binding agreement of the Shareholders spouse, enforceable against the
Shareholders spouse in accordance with its terms.

  

###### 2.3 _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(a) require the Shareholder to file or register with, or obtain any permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any governmental agency, authority,
administrative or regulatory body, court or other tribunal, foreign or
domestic, or any other entity other than filings with the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act, or (b) violate, or cause a breach of or default under, or
conflict with any contract, agreement or understanding, any Law binding upon
the Shareholder, except for such violations, breaches, defaults or conflicts
which are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have an
adverse effect on the Shareholders ability to satisfy its obligations under
this Agreement. No proceedings are pending which, if adversely determined,
will have an adverse effect on any ability to vote or dispose of any of the
Securities. The Shareholder has not previously assigned or sold any of the
Securities to any third party.

  

###### 2.4 _Shareholder Has Adequate Information_.  Shareholder is a
sophisticated seller with respect to the Securities and has adequate
information concerning the business and financial condition of the Company to
make an informed decision regarding the sale of the Securities and has
independently and without reliance upon either Sub or Parent and based
on such information as Shareholder has deemed appropriate, made its own
analysis and decision to    

enter into this Agreement. Shareholder acknowledges that neither Sub
nor Parent has made and neither makes any representation or warranty,
whether express or implied, of any kind or character except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement. Shareholder acknowledges that the agreements
contained herein with respect to the Securities by Shareholder are
irrevocable (prior to the Termination Date), and that Shareholder shall have
no recourse to the Securities, Parent or Sub, except with respect to breaches
of representations, warranties, covenants and agreements expressly set forth
in this Agreement.

  

###### 2.5 _No Setoff_. The Shareholder has no liability or obligation
related to or in connection with the Securities other than the obligations to
Parent and Sub as set forth in this Agreement. There are no legal or equitable
defenses or counterclaims that have been or may be asserted by or on behalf
of the Company or the Shareholder to reduce the amount of the Securities or
affect the validity or enforceability of the Securities.

  

###### 2.6 _No Amounts Payable to Shareholder_. Except as disclosed in the
Merger Agreement, there are no amounts due or payable by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to the Shareholder or any of its affiliates or associates
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
this Agreement or otherwise (other than any payments required under the
Merger Agreement solely in exchange for equity securities of the Company).

  

##### 3. _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Sub_.  Parent and Sub
hereby represent and warrant to Shareholder, as of the date hereof that:

  

###### 3.1 _Authorization_. Parent and Sub have all requisite corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Sub have duly executed and
delivered this Agreement and this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding
agreement of each of Parent and Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and
Sub in accordance with its terms.

  

###### 3.2 _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
violate, or cause a breach of or default under, any contract or agreement,
any statute or law, or any judgment, decree, order, regulation or rule of any
governmental agency, authority, administrative or regulatory body, court or
other tribunal, foreign or domestic, or any other entity or any arbitration
award binding upon Parent or Sub, except for such violations, breaches or
defaults which are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
either Parents or Subs ability to satisfy its obligations under this
Agreement.

  

##### 4. _Survival of Representations and Warranties_.  The respective
representations and warranties of Shareholder, Parent and Sub contained
herein shall not be deemed waived or otherwise affected by any investigation
made by the other party hereto.  The representations and warranties contained
herein shall survive the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, including
extensions thereof.

  

##### 5. _Specific Performance_. Shareholder acknowledges that Sub and
Parent will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy
at law for a violation of any of the    

covenants or agreements of Shareholder which are contained in this Agreement.
It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedies which may be
available to Sub and Parent upon the breach by Shareholder of such covenants
and agreements, Sub and Parent shall have the right to obtain injunctive
relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of such covenants or
agreements or otherwise to obtain specific performance of any of such
covenants or agreements.

  

##### 6. _Miscellaneous_.

  

###### 6.1 _Term_. This Agreement and all obligations hereunder shall
terminate upon the earlier of (i) the day after the Merger is consummated,
(ii) December 31, 2007, (iii) the date of any modification, waiver or
amendment to the Merger Agreement in a manner that reduces the amount
and form of consideration payable thereunder to the Shareholder, and (iv)
the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 thereof
(the earliest of (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the "Termination Date").

  

###### 6.2 _Fiduciary Duties_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary: (a) the Shareholder makes no agreement or understanding herein
in any capacity other than in the Shareholders capacity as a record holder
and beneficial owner of Securities, and (b) nothing herein will be construed
to limit or affect any action or inaction by the Shareholder or any
Representative of the Shareholder, as applicable, serving on the
Company Board of Directors or on the board of directors of any Company
Subsidiary or as an officer or fiduciary of the Company or any of Company
Subsidiary, acting in such persons capacity as a director, officer or
fiduciary of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 **AMENDED AND RESTATED**

  

 **CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION**

  

 **OF**

  

 **BIOENVISION, INC.** 1. The name of the corporation is: **__** Bioenvision, Inc.

  

2. The address of its registered office in the State of Delaware is Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle. The name of its registered agent at such address is The Corporation Trust Company.

  

3. The purpose of this corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

  

4. The total number of shares of stock which this corporation shall have authority to issue is One Thousand (1,000) shares of Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share, amounting in the aggregate to One Hundred Dollars ($100.00). Each share of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote.

  

5. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the by-laws of this corporation shall provide.

  

6. Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware, as the by-laws may provide. The books of the corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained in the statutes) outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the board of directors or in the by-laws of the corporation.

  

7. This corporation shall, to the maximum extent permitted from time to time under the law of the State of Delaware, indemnify and upon request advance expenses to any person who is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, proceeding or claim, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such person is or was or has agreed to be a director or officer of this corporation or while a director or officer is or was serving at the request of this corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of any corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement incurred (and not otherwise recovered) in connection with the investigation, preparation to defend or defense of such action, suit, proceeding or claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,    

that the foregoing shall not require this corporation to indemnify or advance
expenses to any person in connection with any action, suit, proceeding, claim
or counterclaim initiated by or on behalf of such person unless such action,
suit, proceeding, claim or counterclaim was authorized in the specific case
by the board of directors of the corporation. Such indemnification shall not
be exclusive of other indemnification rights arising under any by-law,
agreement, vote of directors or stockholders or otherwise and shall inure to
the benefit of the heirs and legal representatives of such person. Any person
seeking indemnification under this paragraph 8 shall be deemed to have met
the standard of conduct required for such indemnification unless the contrary
shall be established. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions
of this paragraph 8 shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a
director or officer of this corporation with respect to any acts or omissions
of such director or officer occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

  

8. A director of this corporation shall not be liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent that exculpation from liability is not permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as in effect at the time such liability is determined. No amendment or repeal of this paragraph 9 shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

  

9. The corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

 **Annex IV**

  

 **AMENDED AND RESTATED**

  

 **BY-LAWS**

  

 **OF**

  

 **BIOENVISION, INC.**

  

# SECTION 1 LAW, CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS

  

## 1.1 _These_ by-laws are subject to the certificate of incorporation of the
corporation. In these by-laws, references to law, the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws mean the law, the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation and the by-laws as from time to time in effect.

  

# SECTION 2 STOCKHOLDERS

  

## 2.1 _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held at
a place and time designated by the board of directors, unless that day be a
legal holiday at the place where the meeting is to be held, in which case the
meeting shall be held at the same hour on the next succeeding day not a legal
holiday, or at such other date and time as shall be designated from time to
time by the board of directors and stated in the notice of the meeting,
at which they shall elect a board of directors and transact such other
business as may be required by law or these by-laws or as may properly come
before the meeting.

  

## 2.2 _Special Meetings_. A special meeting of the stockholders may
be called at any time by the chairman of the board, if any, the president or
the board of directors. A special meeting of the stockholders shall be
called by the secretary, or in the case of the death, absence, incapacity or
refusal of the secretary, by an assistant secretary or some other officer,
upon application of a majority of the directors. Any such application shall
state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. Any such call shall
state the place, date, hour, and purposes of the meeting.

  

## 2.3 _Place of Meeting_. All meetings of the stockholders for the election
of directors or for any other purpose shall be held at such place within or
without the State of Delaware as may be determined from time to time by the
chairman of the board, if any, the president or the board of directors. Any
adjourned session of any meeting of the stockholders shall be held at the
place designated in the vote of adjournment.

  

## 2.4 _Notice of Meetings_. Except as otherwise provided by law, a written
notice of each meeting of stockholders stating the place, day and hour
thereof and, in the case of a special meeting, the purposes for which the
meeting is called, shall be given not less then ten nor more than sixty days
before the meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat, and to each
stockholder who, by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-
laws, is entitled to notice, by leaving such notice with him or at
his residence or usual place of business, or by    

depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to
such stockholder at his address as it appears in the records of the
corporation. Such notice shall be given by the secretary, or by an officer or
person designated by the board of directors, or in the case of a special
meeting by the officer calling the meeting. As to any adjourned session of
any meeting of stockholders, notice of the adjourned meeting need not
be given if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which
the adjournment was taken except that if the adjournment is for more than
thirty days or if after the adjournment a new record date is set for the
adjourned session, notice of any such adjourned session of the meeting shall
be given in the manner heretofore described. No notice of any meeting of
stockholders or any adjourned session thereof need be given to a stockholder
if a written waiver of notice, executed before or after the meeting or such
adjourned session by such stockholder, is filed with the records of the
meeting or if the stockholder attends such meeting without objecting at the
beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be
transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the stockholders or any
adjourned session thereof need be specified in any written waiver of notice.

  

## 2.5 _Quorum of Stockholders_. At any meeting of the stockholders a quorum
as to any matter shall consist of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast
on the matter, except where a larger quorum is required by law, by the
certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws. Any meeting may be adjourned
from time to time by a majority of the votes properly cast upon the question,
whether or not a quorum is present. If a quorum is present at an original
meeting, a quorum need not be present at an adjourned session of that
meeting. Shares of its own stock belonging to the corporation or to another
corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of
directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the
corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum
purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of
any corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock,
held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

  

## 2.6 _Action by Vote_. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a plurality
of the votes properly cast for election to any office shall elect to such
office and a majority of the votes properly cast upon any question other than
an election to an office shall decide the question, except when a larger vote
is required by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws.
No ballot shall be required for any election unless requested by a
stockholder present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in the
election.

  

## 2.7 _Action Without Meetings_. Unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken by
stockholders for or in connection with any corporate action may be taken
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or
consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed
by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number
of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

  

If action is taken by less than unanimous consent of stockholders, prompt
notice of the taking of such action without a meeting shall be given to those
who have not consented in writing and a certificate signed and attested to by
the secretary that such notice was given shall be filed with the records of
the meetings of stockholders.    

In the event that the action which is consented to is such as would have
required the filing of a certificate under any provision of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, if such action had been voted upon
by the stockholders at a meeting thereof, the certificate filed under such
provision shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such provision
concerning a vote of stockholders, that written consent has been given under
Section 228 of said General Corporation Law and that written notice has been
given as provided in such Section 228.

  

## 2.8 _Proxy Representation_. Every stockholder may authorize another
person or persons to act for him by proxy in all matters in which a
stockholder is entitled to participate, whether by waiving notice of any
meeting, objecting to or voting or participating at a meeting, or expressing
consent or dissent without a meeting. Every proxy must be signed by the
stockholder or by his attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be voted or acted
upon after three years from its date unless such proxy provides for a longer
period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is
irrevocable and, if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made
irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an
interest in the stock itself or an interest in the corporation generally. The
authorization of a proxy may but need not be limited to specified action,
provided, however, that if a proxy limits its authorization to a meeting or
meetings of stockholders, unless otherwise specifically provided such proxy
shall entitle the holder thereof to vote at any adjourned session but shall
not be valid after the final adjournment thereof.

  

## 2.9 _Inspectors_. The directors or the person presiding at the meeting
may, and shall if required by applicable law, appoint one or more inspectors
of election and any substitute inspectors to act at the meeting or any
adjournment thereof. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of
his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best
of his ability. The inspectors, if any, shall determine the number of shares
of stock outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares of stock
represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and
effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear
and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the
right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine
the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote
with fairness to all stockholders. On request of the person presiding at the
meeting, the inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge,
question or matter determined by them and execute a certificate of any fact
found by them.

  

## 2.10 _List of Stockholders_. The secretary shall prepare and make, at
least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order
and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares
registered in his name. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who
are stockholders entitled to examine such list or to vote in person or by
proxy at such meeting.

  

# SECTION 3 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  

## 3.1 _Number_. The corporation shall have one or more directors. The number
of directors shall initially be fixed at two and may be adjusted from time to
time by vote of a majority of the directors then in office.  Except in
connection with the election of directors at the annual meeting of
stockholders, the number of directors may be decreased only to eliminate    

vacancies by reason of death, resignation or removal of one or more
directors. No director need be a stockholder.

  

## 3.2 _Tenure_. Except as otherwise provided by law, by the certificate of
incorporation or by these by-laws, each director shall hold office until the
next annual meeting and until his successor is elected and qualified, or
until he sooner dies, resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified.

  

## 3.3 _Powers_. The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed
by or under the direction of the board of directors who shall have and may
exercise all the powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and
things as are not by law, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws
directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

  

## 3.4 _Vacancies_. Vacancies and any newly created directorships resulting
from any increase in the number of directors may be filled by vote of the
holders of the particular class or series of stock entitled to elect
such director at a meeting called for the purpose, or by a majority of the
directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director, in each case elected by the particular class or series of stock
entitled to elect such directors. When one or more directors shall resign
from the board, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then
in office, including those who have resigned, who were elected by the
particular class or series of stock entitled to elect such resigning director
or directors shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote or
action by writing thereon to take effect when such resignation or
resignations shall become effective. The directors shall have and may exercise
all their powers notwithstanding the existence of one or more vacancies in
their number, subject to any requirements of law or of the certificate
of incorporation or of these by-laws as to the number of directors required
for a quorum or for any vote or other actions.

  

## 3.5 _Committees_. The board of directors may, by vote of a majority of the
whole board, (a) designate, change the membership of or terminate the
existence of any committee or committees, each committee to consist of one or
more of the directors; (b) designate one or more directors as alternate
members of any such committee who may replace any absent or disqualified
member at any meeting of the committee; and (c) determine the extent to which
each such committee shall have and may exercise the powers of the board of
directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation,
including the power to authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to
all papers which require it and the power and authority to declare dividends
or to authorize the issuance of stock; excepting, however, such powers which
by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws they are
prohibited from so delegating.  In the absence or disqualification of any
member of such committee and his alternate, if any, the member or members
thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or
not constituting a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the
board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or
disqualified member. Except as the board of directors may otherwise
determine, any committee may make rules for the conduct of its business, but
unless otherwise provided by the board or such rules, its business shall be
conducted as nearly as may be in the same manner as is provided by these by-
laws for the conduct of business by the board of directors. Each committee
shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the board
of directors upon request.    

## 

  

## 3.6 _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the board of directors may be
held without call or notice at such places within or without the State of
Delaware and at such times as the board may from time to time determine,
provided that notice of the first regular meeting following any such
determination shall be given to absent directors. A regular meeting of the
directors may be held without call or notice immediately after and at the
same place as the annual meeting of stockholders.

  

## 3.7 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the board of directors may be
held at any time and at any place within or without the State of Delaware
designated in the notice of the meeting, when called by the chairman of the
board, if any, the president, or by one-third or more in number of the
directors, reasonable notice thereof being given to each director by the
secretary or by the chairman of the board, if any, the president or any one
of the directors calling the meeting.

  

## 3.8 _Notice_. It shall be reasonable and sufficient notice to a director
to send notice by mail at least forty-eight hours or by telegram at least
twenty-four hours before the meeting addressed to him at his usual or last
known business or residence address or to give notice to him in person or by
telephone at least twenty-four hours before the meeting. Notice of a meeting
need not be given to any director if a written waiver of notice, executed by
him before or after the meeting, is filed with the records of the meeting, or
to any director who attends the meeting without protesting prior thereto or
at its commencement the lack of notice to him. Neither notice of a meeting
nor a waiver of a notice need specify the purposes of the meeting.

  

## 3.9 _Quorum_. Except as may be otherwise provided by law, by the
certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws, at any meeting of
the directors a majority of the directors then in office shall constitute a
quorum; a quorum shall not in any case be less than one-third of the total
number of directors constituting the whole board.  Any meeting may be
adjourned from time to time by a majority of the votes cast upon the
question, whether or not a quorum is present, and the meeting may be held as
adjourned without further notice.

  

## 3.10 _Action by Vote_. Except as may be otherwise provided by law, by the
certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws, when a quorum is present at
any meeting the vote of a majority of the directors present shall be the act
of the board of directors.

  

## 3.11 _Action Without a Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to be

taken without a meeting if all the members of the board or of such committee,
as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and such writing or writings

Such consent shall be treated for all purposes as the act of the board or of
such committee, as the case may be.

  

## 3.12 _Participation in Meetings by Conference Telephone_.  Members of the
board of directors, or any committee designated by such board, may
participate in a meeting of such board or committee by means of conference

director may be paid such fees for his services as director and be reimbursed

the meeting of the board or committee thereof which authorizes the contract
or transaction, or solely because his or their votes are counted for such
purpose, if:

  

#### (i) The material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board of directors

a quorum; or

  

#### (ii) The material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically
approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or

  

#### (iii) The contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation as of
the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the board of directors, a
committee thereof, or the stockholders.

  

### (b) Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the

at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at
the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting

the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of
directors is required by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting
forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware by hand or
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to its principal
place of business or to an officer or agent of the corporation having custody
of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If

the board of directors is required by the General Corporation Law of the

consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the
close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the
resolution taking such prior action.

of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which
record date shall be not more than sixty days prior to such payment, exercise
or other action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto.
