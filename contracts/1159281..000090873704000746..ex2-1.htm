When used in this Agreement, the term "Effective Time" shall mean the date and time at which such Certificate of Merger is so filed (or at such later time as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger). ARTICLE 2 
THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

 (b) The officers of Sub at the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the  Surviving Corporation and shall hold office from the Effective Time until their  respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualify in the manner  provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving  Corporation, or as otherwise provided by law. 

     

ARTICLE 3 
CONVERSION OF SHARES; DETERMINATION OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

   

 Section 3.01. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof: 

   

 (a) Each share of Companys Class A Non-Voting Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Class A Non-Voting Common Stock"), outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to  receive an amount in cash equal to the Class A Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) Each share of Companys Class B Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Class B Common Stock" and, together with the Class A  Non-Voting Common Stock, the "Common Stock"), outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to  receive an amount in cash equal to the Class B Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) Each share of Companys Series C Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share  (the "Series C Preferred Stock"), outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Series C Merger Consideration. 

     (d) Each share of Companys Series D Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share  (the "Series D Preferred Stock" and, together with the Series C Preferred Stock, the "Preferred Stock," and such Preferred  Stock, together with the Common Stock, the "Shares"),  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the  right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Series D Merger Consideration. 

   

 (e) Each Share held in the treasury of Company, if any, immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (f) Each share of Common Stock of the Sub, par value $.01 per share, issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and  become a fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock of the Surviving  Corporation. 

   

 Section 3.02. _Surrender And Payment_. (a) If Company determines to do so, it may mail the letter of transmittal and instructions in the form attached as Exhibit A (the "Letter of Transmittal") to each or any record holder of Shares prior to the Closing Date. No later than five days prior to the Closing Date, Company shall deliver to Parent a schedule (the "Section 3.02 Schedule") setting forth the names of those Persons who have returned duly executed Letters of Transmittal, the number and type of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock held by those Persons and wire instructions for those Persons. Immediately following the Effective Time, and upon surrender by the Person(s) named in the Section 3.02 Schedule of (x) the stock certificate or certificates representing the Shares (the "Certificates") held by such Person(s) and (y) a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, Parent shall pay or shall cause Sub to pay (by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account specified in the Section 3.02 Schedule) to the Persons complying with the foregoing, the applicable Final Merger Consideration payable in exchange for the Shares so surrendered, less any amounts in respect of transfer or other taxes required to be withheld. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Person" means an individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, trust or other entity or organization, including a government or political subdivision or an agency or instrumentality thereof. 

   

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send to each holder of Shares  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than those Persons  listed on the Section 3.02 Schedule) the Letter of Transmittal. 

   

 (c) At and after the Effective Time each holder of Shares outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender to  Parent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed and duly executed  Letter of Transmittal, the applicable Final Merger Consideration payable for  each such Share represented by the surrendered Certificate. Until so

      surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time
for  all purposes only the right to receive the applicable Final Merger 
Consideration.

    

 (d) If any portion of the applicable Final Merger Consideration is to be paid to a  Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is  registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate  shall be properly endorsed and otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to Parent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (e) After the Effective Time, holders of Shares shall cease to have any rights as a  holder of Shares, except for the right to surrender Certificates in the manner  prescribed by Section 3.02(c) in exchange for payment of the applicable Final  Merger Consideration, or in the case of a holder of Dissenting Shares, the right to perfect the right to receive payment for Dissenting Shares pursuant to  Section 262 of the DGCL. 

   

 (f) Any portion of the Final Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation, and any such holder who has not exchanged such Shares for the applicable Final Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article 3 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for  payment of the applicable Final Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation  shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 Section 3.03. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 3.02, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL (such Shares, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right to receive the applicable Final Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the applicable Final Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.02. Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in 

     all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except
with the prior written consent of Parent, Company shall not make any payment
with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

   

 Section 3.04. _Employee Stock Options_. (a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each In-the-Money Option, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall be cancelled, and thereafter shall represent only the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Class A Merger Consideration for each Share for which such In-the-Money Option is then exercisable (assuming full vesting of such In-the-Money Option) less the applicable exercise price of such In-the-Money Option. 

   

 (b) Each and any other option or warrant or other right to purchase or otherwise acquire Shares which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Company Options which are not In-the-Money Options) shall be cancelled at the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be paid in exchange therefor and each holder of such option, warrant or other right shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect thereto. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, each participant (or the beneficiary thereof) in the  Deferred Compensation Plan shall be entitled to receive with respect to each  Deemed Share, if any, credited to each such participants account under the Deferred Compensation Plan as of the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the Class A Merger Consideration. 

   

 Section 3.05. _Closing of Company Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Company shall be closed and no transfer of Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 3.02(c), they shall be exchanged for the applicable Final Merger Consideration. 

   

 Section 3.06. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the applicable Final Merger Consideration for each affected class or series of Shares and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. 

   

 Section 3.07. _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 3 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of Tax Law. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of 

    which Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

   

 Section 3.08. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, Parent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Final Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate in accordance with Section 3.02. 

   

 Section 3.09. _Closing; Revisions to Determination Date_. (a) Subject to Section 3.09(b), the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Sullivan and Worcester LLP, One Post Office Square, Boston, MA, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the fifth business day after the day on which each of the conditions set forth in Article 8 hereof are satisfied, or waived by each of the parties entitled to the benefits of such condition, or at such other date, time and place as Parent and Company shall agree. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding Section 3.09(a), 

       | (i)   if the Closing would otherwise take place less
than five business days prior to  the last day of a calendar quarter, the
Closing and the Closing Date shall take  place on the first business day of
the next calendar quarter and the  Determination Date shall, automatically
and without any further action by any  party, become the last day of the
second calendar month preceding the Closing  Date; and    
---|--- 
   
       | (ii) if any of the conditions to Closing remains
unsatisfied (or has not been waived)  as of the first business day prior to
the Expected Closing Date (as such  Expected Closing Date is initially agreed
by the parties or as revised pursuant  to this Section 3.09(b)(ii)), the
parties shall agree upon a revised Expected  Closing Date, and the
Determination Date shall, subject to Section 3.09(b)(i),  automatically and
without any further action by any party, become the last day  of the calendar
month preceding such revised Expected Closing Date.    
---|--- 
   
   

 Section 3.10. _Closing Balance Sheet_. (a) As promptly as practicable, but in any event not later than 20 calendar days, after the Determination Date, Company will cause to be prepared and delivered to each of Ernst andYoung LLP (Nashville) ("EandY") and Parent the consolidated balance sheet of Company as of the Determination Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet (defined below). The Closing Balance Sheet shall present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of the 

    Determination Date and be prepared in accordance with GAAP and accounting
policies and practices applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of
the Balance Sheet. The Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet (the "Adjusted Closing
Balance Sheet") shall be the Closing Balance Sheet adjusted in the manner
described on Exhibit B (the "Adjustments"), which includes a sample of the
Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet as if the Closing had occurred on July
31, 2004. The Closing Balance Sheet and the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet
shall both include line items consistent with those in the Balance Sheet and
(other than as required by the Adjustments). At such time as Company delivers
the Closing Balance Sheet and Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet, it shall also
deliver to EandY its preliminary determination of the Merger Consideration (the
"Preliminary Determination of Merger Consideration").

   

 (b) EandY thereafter shall perform the procedures set forth on Exhibit C (the "Agreed-Upon Procedures") with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet, the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Determination of Merger Consideration. EandY, on the second business day prior to the Closing Date, shall deliver to Company and Parent the Agreed-Upon Procedures Report referred to in Exhibit C regarding the Closing Balance Sheet, the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet, and the Preliminary Determination of Merger Consideration (such Closing Balance Sheet, Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet and Preliminary  Determination of Merger Consideration as adjusted pursuant to any findings of  the Agreed-Upon Procedures Report, the "Final Closing Balance  Sheet", "Final Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet" and  "Final Merger Consideration", respectively). Absent manifest  error, the Final Merger Consideration shall be final and binding on Company and  Parent; _provided_ that if the sale of the equity interests of one of the  Company Subsidiaries in Morningside of Albany Company (the "Albany  Sale") occurs after the delivery by Company to EandY of its  preliminary determination of Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.10(a)  and prior to the Effective Time (and the net proceeds therefrom have not been  included in the determination of Final Merger Consideration as described in the  Agreed-Upon Procedures Report), then the Final Merger Consideration shall be  increased by the amount of net proceeds from such sale and _provided  further_ that, to the extent that the aggregate amount of Final Company  Transaction Costs differs from the aggregate amount of Company Transaction Costs reflected in the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet (such corresponding amount, the "Preliminary Company Transaction Costs"), then the Final Merger Consideration shall be increased if the Preliminary Company Transaction Costs exceed the Final Company Transaction Costs, or decreased if the Final Company Transaction Costs exceed the Preliminary Company Transaction Costs, in each case by the amount of such difference. 

   

 (c) Parent and Company agree that they will, and Company agrees to cause each Company Subsidiary to, cooperate with and assist EandY in performing the Agreed-Upon Procedures with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet, the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet, and the Preliminary Determination of Merger 

    Consideration, including the making available to the extent necessary of
books, records, work papers and personnel of Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

     

ARTICLE 4 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

   

 Company represents and warrants to Parent as of the date hereof that, except as set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered to Parent contemporaneously herewith (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"): 

   

 Section 4.01. _Organization_. (a) Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation and has the corporate power to carry on its business as it is now being conducted or presently proposed to be conducted and to own, lease and manage all of the properties owned, leased or managed by it. Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or held under lease or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, a "Company Material Adverse Effect"means any event, circumstance, condition, development or occurrence resulting in a material adverse effect on (i) the business, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) the ability of Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (iii) the ability of Company to consummate the Merger; _provided_ that "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall exclude any effect resulting from (i) this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the announcement thereof, (ii) Parents announcement or other disclosure of its plans or intentions with respect to the conduct of the business (or any portion thereof) of Company or any Company Subsidiary or (iii) changes or conditions (including changes in economic, financial market, regulatory or political conditions, whether resulting from acts of terrorism or war or otherwise) affecting the U.S. economy or assisted living industry generally. 

   

 (b) Company has delivered to Parent complete and accurate copies of each of its Charter Documents. 

   

 Section 4.02. _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of Company consists of (i) 4,000,000 shares of Class A Non-Voting Common Stock; (ii) 8,250,000 shares of Class B Common Stock; (iii) 280,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock; and (iv) 720,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. As of the date hereof, there are outstanding (i) 1,065,927.6 shares of Class A Non-Voting Common Stock; (ii) 3,880,743.6 shares of Class B Common Stock; (iii) 280,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock; (iv) 321,000.6 shares of Series D Preferred Stock; and (v) Company Options to purchase an aggregate of 847,653.3 shares of 

    Class A Non-Voting Common Stock. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan,
Company has credited an aggregate of 5,688.58 Deemed Shares to participant
accounts as of the date of this Agreement. Section 4.02 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth the number, class or series and record owner
of the issued and outstanding Shares, Company Options and Deemed Shares, in
each case as of the date of this Agreement. All of the outstanding Shares
were validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
any preemptive (or similar) rights. All of the Company Options were validly
issued. To Companys knowledge, none of the outstanding Shares, Company
Options or Deemed Shares are subject to any Lien. The Shares of Class B
Common Stock identified in Section 4.02 of the Company Disclosure Schedule as
being outstanding on the date of this Agreement (together with Shares issued
after the date of this Agreement, if any, on exercise of Company Options) are
the only capital stock of Company entitled to vote on the Merger. Except as
described above, there are not now, and at the Effective Time there will not
be, any outstanding shares of capital stock or other voting securities of
Company or any outstanding options, warrants, subscriptions, calls, rights,
convertible or exchangeable securities or other agreements or commitments
obligating Company to issue, grant or extend any option, warrant,
subscription, call, right, convertible or exchangeable security or to
transfer, sell, redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any shares of its
capital stock or other voting securities, or the capital stock or other
voting securities of any Company Subsidiary.

   

 Section 4.03. _Subsidiaries_.

 Section 4.11. _Taxes_. All Tax returns, schedules, statements, reports, forms and amendments thereto (collectively, the "Returns") that are material and required to be filed with any Taxing Authority on or before the date hereof by, or with respect to, Company or any Company Subsidiary have been timely filed on or before the Closing Date, and, all such Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects. Without limiting the foregoing sentence, Company has attached (or will have attached) to its federal Income Tax Return for 2003, in respect of its 2003 Tax year and in respect of any earlier Tax year of Company or any Company Subsidiary for which such information statements should have been filed but were not, the information statements required by Treasury Regulations Sections 1.382-2T(a)(2)(ii), 1.1502-92(e), or 1.1502-94(d). All such Returns have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Law in all material respects. All Taxes shown to be due on such Returns and material Taxes otherwise due have been timely paid by Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The charges, accruals and reserves for Taxes with respect to Company and the Company Subsidiaries reflected on the books of Company and the Company Subsidiaries are adequate, under GAAP, to cover material Tax liabilities accruing through the end of the last period for which Company and the Company Subsidiaries ordinarily record items on their respective books. Neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, is bound by or has any obligation under any Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnification agreement or similar contract or arrangement, and neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any potential liability or obligation to any Person as a result of, or pursuant to, any such agreement, contract or arrangement. Neither Company nor any Company 

    Subsidiary has been a member of any affiliated group within the meaning of
Section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), or any
similar affiliated group for Tax purposes under state, local or foreign law
(other than a group comprised solely of one or more of Company or the Company
Subsidiaries), or has any liability for Taxes of another Person (other than
one or more of Company or the Company Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation
1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law as a
transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under
Sections 355 or 356 of the Code in the two (2) years prior to the date of
this Agreement. There is no action, suit, proceeding, investigation, audit or
claim now proposed or pending against or with respect to Company or any
Company Subsidiary in respect of any material Tax. Neither Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has taken any deduction or received any Tax benefit
arising from participation in a "tax shelter" as defined for purposes of
Section 6111(c) of the Code or has "participated" in a "reportable
transaction" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b). Except
for Company and LifeTrust America, Inc., each Company Subsidiary is, and since
its formation has been, properly characterized as a partnership or a
"disregarded entity"under Treasury Regulation Sections 301.7701-2 and
301.7701-3 for United States federal (and except as set forth in Section 4.11
of the Company Disclosure Schedule for state and local) income tax purposes
and not as an association taxable as a corporation nor, for avoidance of
doubt, as a "publicly traded partnership" treated as a corporation under
Section 7704 of the Code (or any similar Tax Law).

   

 Section 4.12. _Title to Properties; Encumbrances_. Each of Company and the Company Subsidiaries has good, valid and marketable (and, in the case of any Owned Real Property, fee simple) title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all of its properties and assets (real, personal and mixed, tangible and intangible), including all the properties and assets reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2004 included in the Company Financial Statements, other than supplies, inventory and equipment used, sold or transferred since such date in the ordinary course of business. None of such properties or assets are subject to any Lien of any kind (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), except for Permitted Liens and the matters described in the Title Policies and Surveys. 

   

 Section 4.13. _Compliance with Applicable Law; Licenses and Permits_. (a) Company, each of the Company Subsidiaries and each Company Facility have been and are in compliance with all applicable Laws, except where the failure to be in such compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) To the actual knowledge, without independent investigation, of W. Patrick Mulloy  II and Carl Johnson, as of the date hereof, Company and each 

     Company Subsidiary  possess and have been and is in compliance with all
permits, licenses,  franchises, variances, exceptions, orders, consents,
approvals, authorizations  of and registrations with and under all Laws, and
from all Governmental  Authorities, required by Company and each Company
Subsidiary to carry on their  respective businesses as currently conducted
and to use, operate, own or lease,  and occupy each Company Facility in the
manner currently used, operated, owned  or leased, and occupied
(collectively, "Permits") except where  the failure to have or be in
compliance with a Permit would not be reasonably  likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, an adverse effect on the  operation of a
Company Facility. The Permits are valid and in full force and  effect. Except
for those Permits obtained in the ordinary course of business  with respect
to which Company has a reasonable expectation that such Permits  shall
continue to remain in effect until the Effective Time, no Permit is 
provisional or conditional and no appeals have been taken or are pending
with  respect to any Permit. Neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in
default  under and no condition exists that with notice or lapse of time or
both would  constitute a default under, any Permit and neither Company nor
any Company  Subsidiary has received written notice from any Governmental
Authority that it  is not in compliance with any Permit, which non-compliance
has not been cured.  None of the Permits will be terminated or impaired or
become terminable, in  whole or in part, as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Company has delivered to Parent complete and accurate copies of each Lease and each Consulting and Services Agreement as amended through the date hereof. Each  Lease and Consulting and Services Agreement constitutes the entire agreement  between the parties thereto in connection with the subject of such agreement. 

   

 (e) The plants, buildings and structures comprising each Company Facility currently  have valid legal access to (i) public roads or valid easements over private  streets or private property for such ingress to and egress from all such plants, buildings and structures and (ii) water supply, storm and sanitary sewer facilities, telephone, gas and electrical connections, fire protection, drainage and other public utilities, in each case as is necessary for the operation of such Company Facility as heretofore conducted.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

   

 Parent represents and warrants to Company, as of the date hereof, as follows: 

   

 Section 5.01. _Organization_. Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland. Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each of Parent and Sub has all corporate powers and all licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals of Governmental Authorities required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of which would not individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or materially delay or impair the ability of Parent or its subsidiaries (each, a "Parent Subsidiary" and collectively, the "Parent Subsidiaries") to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (a "Parent Material Adverse Effect");  _provided_ that "Parent Material Adverse Effect" shall exclude any effect resulting from (i) this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the announcement thereof, (ii) Parents announcement or other disclosure of its 

   plans or intentions with respect to the conduct of the business (or any
portion thereof) of Company or any Company Subsidiary or (iii) changes or
conditions (including changes in economic, financial market, regulatory or
political conditions, whether resulting from acts of terrorism or war or
otherwise) affecting the U.S. economy or assisted living industry generally.
Sub was formed on September 21, 2004 and has engaged in no activity other
than in connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement.

     

 Section 5.02. _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Each of Parent and Sub has the corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to carry out its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Sub and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Sub and duly approved and adopted by the stockholders of Sub, and no other corporate or stockholder action or proceedings on the part of Parent or Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Sub and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Parent and Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights generally or to general principles of equity. 

   

 Section 5.03. _Consents And Approvals; No Violations_. Except for the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL, and those filings, permits, authorizations, consents or approvals specifically identified on Section 5.03 of the Disclosure Schedule or which have already been obtained or the failure of which to be made or obtained would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, no filing with, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority or other third party is necessary for the consummation by Parent or Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Sub nor the consummation by Parent and Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by each of Parent and Sub with any of the provisions hereof, will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any provisions of its Charter Documents, (b) require any consent or other action by any Person under, result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration or result in any other change of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is entitled) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license, contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets may be bound, (c) result in the creation or imposition of any restriction, Lien or other adverse claim of any kind, including any Lien for Taxes, on any asset of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or (d) violate 

   any order, writ, injunction, decree or Law applicable to Parent, any Parent
Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets, except in the
case of clauses (b) and (c) for violations, breaches or defaults which would
not individually or in the aggregate have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

   

 Section 5.04. _Litigation_. There is no suit, action or proceeding pending or, to Parents knowledge, threatened against or affecting Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, that could materially impair Parents or Subs ability to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 Section 5.05. _Financing_. Attached as Exhibit D is a true and complete copy of a commitment letter pursuant to which Senior Housing Properties Trust has agreed to provide to Sub, subject solely to the conditions set forth therein, between $115,000,000 and $117,000,000 in immediately available funds. Such letter agreement is in full force and effect as of the date hereof and will continue to be in full force and effect until the Closing. Taken together with the net proceeds from the Loan (as defined in the commitment letter attached hereto as Exhibit D) and Parents unencumbered cash on-hand in bank accounts of Parent ("Parent Cash"), Parent and Sub have, and at all times until such payments are made will have, sufficient cash to enable them to make payment of the Final Merger Consideration and any other amounts to be paid by them hereunder or in connection with the Closing (such payments together, the "Closing Payments"). Parent Cash is being held, and will at all times from the date hereof until the Closing Payments are made continue to be held, by Parent for the sole purpose of making the Closing Payments. Parent hereby represents and warrants that its use of the proceeds that it receives from the Loan to make the Closing Payments does not (i) conflict with or result in a breach or default of any other agreement to which Parent or any Affiliate of Parent is a party or becomes a party at any time prior to the Closing, or (ii) require any consent or other action by any Person. 

   

 Section 5.06. _Inspections; No Other Representations_. Parent and Sub are informed and sophisticated purchasers, and have engaged expert advisors, experienced in the evaluation and purchase of companies such as Company and the Company Subsidiaries as contemplated hereunder. Parent and Sub have undertaken such investigation and have been provided with and have evaluated such documents and information as they have deemed necessary to enable them to make informed and intelligent decisions with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement. Parent and Sub acknowledge that Company has given each of Parent and Sub complete and open access to the key employees, documents and facilities of Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Parent and Sub will undertake prior to Closing such further investigation and request such additional documents and information as they deem necessary. Parent and Sub agree that the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article 8 and the acquisition of Company in the Merger shall be based upon their own inspection, examination and determination with respect thereto, and without reliance upon any express or implied representations or warranties of any nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to Company, except, in each case, as expressly set forth in 

   this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and
Sub acknowledge that Company makes no representation or warranty with respect
to (i) any projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or made available
to Parent or Sub of future revenues, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or any
component thereof) of Company and the Company Subsidiaries or the future
business and operations of Company and the Company Subsidiaries or (ii) any
other information or documents made available to Parent, Sub or their
respective counsel, accountants or advisors with respect to Company or the
Company Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or operations, except as

Executive Officer of Company (which notice may be oral). To  the extent that,
in connection with such investigations, any Parent  Representative damages or
disturbs any of the Properties, Parent shall, as  promptly as practicable,

    Environmental Defects, made by the third-party consultant assisting Parent in
its investigation of Company pursuant to Section 7.01, and, in the case of
Title/Survey Defects, made by Parent reasonably and in good faith, of the

will provide to Company copies of all documents used to determine or
indicating the existence of a Defect and Parents estimate of the cost to
cure such Defect.

   

 (b) If Company disagrees with the existence of a Defect or the associated Defect  Amount, then Company shall notify Parent of such disagreement in writing (a  "Notice of Disagreement") within 10 days after its receipt of  the Defect Notice. Such Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable  detail Companys grounds for such disagreement, the Defect Amount estimated by Company therefor, or both, as the case may be. To the extent Company does not contest a Defect or a Defect Amount in a Notice of Disagreement within such 10 day period, Company shall be deemed to have accepted the existence of such Defect or Defect Amount, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes. 

   

 (c) If a Notice of Disagreement is timely provided by Company, Parent and Company  shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of 10 days to resolve any disagreements with respect to the existence of any Defect or Defect Amount  contested in the Notice of Disagreement. If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then Company and Parent agree that they will promptly select one or more independent third party arbitrators with the appropriate experience to resolve any remaining disagreements relating to  Defects relating to the Properties (in each case, the "Arbitrator"). 

   

 (d) The Arbitrator shall determine as promptly as practicable (but in any event within 20 days) following the date on which such dispute is referred to the Arbitrator the existence of any alleged Defect or the disputed Defect Amount, as the case may require, identified in the Notice of Disagreement and not previously resolved by the parties. Each party shall set forth in writing its position regarding the existence of each alleged Defect and each Defect Amount referred to the Arbitrator for resolution and, to the extent that the Arbitrator  determines that a Defect does exist, the Arbitrator shall be permitted to select any Defect Amount between and including the positions of the parties with respect to each such Defect. Each party shall bear its own expenses and the fees and expenses of its own representatives and experts in connection with the preparation, review, dispute (if any) and final determination of any alleged Defects. Parent and Company shall share equally the costs, expenses and fees of the Arbitrator. The determination of the Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties and shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.

resulting from a determination of the Arbitrator pursuant to Section 7.02(d).
An "Agreed-Upon Defect Amount" shall mean any (i) Defect Amount that is not
contested under any Notice of Disagreement, (ii) Defect Amount that is

 Section 7.04. _No Solicitation; Other Offers_. From the date hereof until the termination hereof, Company will not, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors of Company and the Company Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any Person relating to the acquisition of any capital stock or other voting securities of Company or the Company Subsidiaries (including any acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation, or share exchange), (ii) solicit, initiate, or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any Person relating to the acquisition of any material assets of Company or the Company Subsidiaries, or (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding, furnish any information with respect to, assist or participate in, or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek, any of the foregoing. Company will notify Parent immediately if any Person makes any proposal, offer, or bona fide inquiry with respect to any of the foregoing, and provide the identity of such Person and the terms of such proposal, offer or bona fide inquiry. 

   

 Section 7.05. _Employee Benefits_. (a) Not later than October 25, 2004, Parent shall deliver to Company a list of employees which it expects to terminate 60 days after the Closing Date (each such employee, a "Terminating Employee"). Parent agrees that it shall not discriminate in its selection of Terminating Employees on the basis of any characteristic protected under employment discrimination laws ( _i.e._ , race, gender, age, _etc._ ). Each other employee of Company or a Company Subsidiary, including those who are on disability or leave of absence, will continue to be employed after the Effective 

   Time as an "at will" employee, with base compensation and benefits no less
favorable than those currently provided to them prior to the Effective Time.

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall have the right, in the exercise of its managerial discretion, to modify base compensation, bonus programs, incentive compensation and pension and health and welfare benefits from time to time and to terminate the employment of any Person.

   pending action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity by any Person or any
arbitration or administrative or other proceeding relating to the business of
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or the status of such individual as a

 (b) _Allocation of Certain Taxes._

       | (i) Parent and Company agree that if Company or any
Company Subsidiary is permitted but not required under any applicable Tax
Law, including applicable state or local Income Tax Laws, to treat the day

       | (ii) Any Taxes for a Tax period beginning before the
Determination Date and ending after the Determination Date with respect to

based on the actual operations of Company, the Surviving Corporation, and the
Company Subsidiaries. Taxes properly allocated to the portion of such Overlap
Period ending on the Determination Date shall be included in the definition
of Pre-Closing Taxes. Taxes allocated to the portion of such Overlap Period
following the Determination Date shall be excluded from the definition of
Pre-Closing Taxes. For the purposes of the provisions of Section 7.12(a) and
Section 7.12(b), each portion of such Overlap Period shall be deemed to be a

---|--- 
   
   

 (c) _Filing._

       | (i) Company shall have the responsibility to timely

    extensions of time to file) on or before the Closing Date.    
---|--- 
   
       | (ii) Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any

 (d) _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Each of Parent, Company, each Company Subsidiary, and their respective Affiliates will provide the other parties with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any of them in connection with the preparation of any Return, any audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority, any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to  liability for Taxes, and each will retain and provide the others with any  records or information that may be relevant to any such Return, audit or  examination. 

   

 Section 7.13. _Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall (i) obtain any consents from holders of Company Options and any Deemed Shares and (ii) make any amendments to the terms of such Company Options and Deemed Shares that, in the case of either clauses (i) or (ii), are necessary, in Companys reasonable judgment, to give effect to the transactions contemplated by Section 3.04. 

   

 Section 7.14. _Notice of Certain Events_. Not more than six and not less than three calendar days prior to the Expected Closing Date, Company will supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter in existence or occurring as of such date which, if existing or occurring at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered inaccurate as of such date. The delivery of any supplement or amendment to the Company Disclosure Schedule pursuant to this Section 7.14 shall not in any matter constitute a waiver by Parent or Sub of any of the conditions contained in Article 8. 

   

 Section 7.15. _Representation_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation hereby waive, on their own behalves, and agree to cause Company and the Company Subsidiaries to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with (a) the undertaking after the Effective Time by any legal counsel representing the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the Merger to represent any current stockholder, officer, employee or director of Company or any Company Subsidiary (any such Person, a "Designated Person") in a matter involving this Agreement or the Merger and (b) the communication by such counsel to any such Designated Person, in any such representation, of any fact known to such counsel, including in connection with a dispute with Parent or following the Effective Time; _provided_ that the waiver shall not extend to any  

   Person or to matters not involving this Agreement or the Merger and _provided
further_ that such waiver shall not be deemed to be or used as a basis for
contending that the Surviving Corporation has waived its attorney-client
privilege (it being understood that any information which any such Designated
Person or legal counsel learned prior to the Effective Time shall not be
prohibited by virtue of this Section 7.15 from being used in connection with
any such representation by such legal counsel of such Designated Person after
the Effective Time).

   

 Section 7.16. _Compliance With Employment Letters_. Until the satisfaction in full of the obligations of Company or a Company Subsidiary, as applicable, under each letter agreement in the form attached to Section 7.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule that is permitted to be entered into pursuant to Section 6.01 (each, a "Letter Agreement"), the Surviving Corporation will, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries (after the Effective Time) to, comply with all of their respective obligations under each Letter Agreement. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in any event not later than the Effective Time, Company shall coordinate, in consultation with Parent, the delivery to each Terminating Employee a notice complying with the provisions of the WARN Act, it being understood that, nothing contained herein shall relieve the Surviving Corporation of its obligations pursuant to Section 7.06.

Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall submit to holders of the Class B Common Stock a proposal for approval of any benefits or payments arising out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which could reasonably be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code (the "Payments") in a manner that complies with the stockholder approval requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Company shall, contemporaneous with the delivery of such documents to the holders of the Class B Common Stock, deliver to Parent the form of solicitation provided to such holders in connection with the approval of the Payments. 

   

 Section 7.18. _Excess Payments_. Company will not, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, provide any benefit or make any payment which could reasonably be deemed to constitute an "excess parachute payment" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code. 

   

 Section 7.19. _Company Transaction Costs_. At least one business day prior to the Closing Date, Company shall provide Parent with a list of the aggregate amount of Company Transaction Costs through the Closing Date (and estimated where required) to the extent such Company Transaction Costs were not paid prior to the Determination Date, together with statements from service 

   providers and other appropriate supporting documentation (the "Final Company
Transaction Costs").

Any written notice delivered pursuant to this Section 7.20 shall include a copy of the written document or documents evidencing the Required Lender Consents, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Company. 

   

 (b) With respect to each Conversion Subsidiary that is converted pursuant to Section  7.20(a), Parent and Company agree that (i) all references in this Agreement to  such Company Subsidiary shall be to the relevant Conversion Subsidiary (with  appropriate conforming modifications to the representations set forth in and  disclosures made pursuant to Section 4.03) and (ii) such conversion (x) will be  deemed to have occurred after the Effective Time for purposes of Section Section 7.12 and (y) will be deemed not to have occurred for the purposes of the conditions set forth in Section 8.03(a), to the extent such condition relates to the representations and warranties of Company, and Section 8.03(c) of this Agreement, notwithstanding in each case the fact that such conversion may have occurred prior to the Effective Time.
