12 ARTICLE III.

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE

 

CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 

Section 3.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of the Parent Entities:

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that immediately prior to the Effective Time is directly
owned by the Company as treasury stock, or by the Parent Entities at such
time, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, Restricted Shares vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with _Section 3.04(a)_ and shares of Company
Common Stock issued upon settlement of RSUs in accordance with _Section
3.04(b)_ , but excluding shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section
3.01(b)_ and except as provided in _Section 3.01(d)_ with respect to
the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $14.00 in
cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder thereof
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding _Section 3.01(c)_ or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
(i) files with the Company before or at the Shareholders Meeting a written
objection to the Agreement, (ii) neither votes in favor of the Merger nor
consents thereto in writing, and (iii) makes written demand on the Surviving
Corporation within twenty days after the date on which the Effective Time
occurs for payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 351.455 of the
MGBCL (each, a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ "), shall not be converted into or
be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (except as
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 3.01(d)_) but instead such Dissenting
Shareholder after the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive the payment
of the fair value thereof by the Surviving Corporation as provided under the
MGBCL (such shares, the " _Appraisal Shares_ "). Any holder of Company Common
Stock who fails to take any of the actions set forth in this _Section 3.01(d)_
shall neither be deemed a Dissenting Shareholder nor entitled to appraisal
rights as a dissenting shareholder, and each such share of Company Common
Stock of such holder shall thereupon be

 



13  converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.01(c)_. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
payment of the fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock under Section
351.455 of MGBCL, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 

Section 3.02 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there shall be any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), cash
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_ shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to reflect the economic effect thereof.

Section 3.03  _Exchange Fund_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Article III and, in connection therewith, shall enter
into an agreement with the Paying Agent in the form reasonably acceptable to
the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause
to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to this
Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
"); _provided_ , Parent may determine to pay or cause to be paid all or a
portion of the Equity Award Amounts to the Company for payment in accordance
with _Section 3.04(c)_.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each Person who was, as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, a holder of record of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
and which shall otherwise be in customary form), and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to
the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ , and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. As promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
second 

 



14  Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to issue and deliver to each Person who was, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock represented in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "),
other than with respect to shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section
3.01(b)_ and shares the holders of which have complied with each of clauses
(i) and (ii) of _Section_ __ _ 3.01(d)_, a check or wire transfer for the
amount of cash which such Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted into the
right to receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.01(c)_, without such holder
being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal
to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be canceled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, but only if such Certificate is
properly endorsed or otherwise is in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that payment of the Merger Consideration with respect
to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such
Book-Entry Shares are registered. Each Book-Entry Share and, until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.03(b)_, each Certificate, shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof
has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
pursuant to this Article III, except for Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
in respect of Appraisal Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the right
to receive the consideration due with respect to such Appraisal Shares in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.01(d)_ to the extent provided by Section
351.455 or the MGBCL. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this Article III.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates (or automatically in the case of Book-Entry
Shares) in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or such Book-
Entry Shares. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share (other than a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share in respect of Appraisal Shares) is presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the
holder thereof as provided in this Article III.

 

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares for nine months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore
complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent for,
and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, in each case
without interest thereon

 



15  and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to
_Section 3.03(a)_ to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which
appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Parent Entities, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance
with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the
date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A 1 or P 1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent. Nothing
contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the
Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares to receive the Merger Consideration or any holder of a Company
Equity Award to receive the holders Equity Award Amount, in each case as
provided herein. If for any reason (including investment losses) the cash in
the Exchange Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder (but subject to
_Section_ __ _ 3.03(h)_), Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the
Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of
cash required to fully satisfy any such cash payment obligations.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Parent Entities, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted
or withheld, from any amount otherwise payable pursuant to the Merger (or this
Agreement) such amounts as they are required to deduct and withhold under
applicable Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any Parent
Entity assigns its rights under this Agreement, no amounts will be withheld
from any payments in respect of Company Common Stock or Appraisal Shares to
the extent such amounts

 



16  would not have been required under applicable Tax Law to be withheld absent
any such assignment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 3.04 _Company Equity Awards_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Incentive Plans) shall
adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to
terminate the Company Incentive Plans effective as of no later than
immediately prior to the Effective Time and to provide that the following
actions shall occur:

Section 5.01 _Organization; Qualification_. Each of the Parent Entities is an
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as presently conducted, except where the
failure to have such power and authority would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to prevent or materially delay consummation
of the Merger and the other Transactions, or the Parent Entities ability to
observe and perform their material obligations hereunder (the " _Parent
Material Adverse Effect_ ").

 

Section 5.02 _Authority; Government Approvals; Non-Contravention_.

 

(a) Each of the Parent Entities has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into and deliver this Agreement and, subject to adoption
of this Agreement by Intermediate Co as sole shareholder of Sub (which

41  the execution of this Agreement) and the filing of the Summary Articles of

the Parent Entities, the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions
and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement by each of the Parent
Entities, have been duly and validly authorized by all requisite corporate
action on the part of each of the Parent Entities, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Parent Entities (including any direct or
indirect shareholder action) on the part of the Parent Entities are necessary
to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions, including the
Merger subject, in the case of filing the Summary Articles of Merger and
consummating the Merger, to approval of this Agreement by Intermediate Co as
sole shareholder of Sub (which approval will occur immediately following
execution of this Agreement). This Agreement has been duly executed and

Disclosure Schedule; and (vii) any such consent, approval, order, waiver,
authorization, permit, action, non-action, registration, declaration, filing
or notification the failure of which to make or obtain would not, individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by the Parent Entities of this
Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other Transactions and compliance with the provisions hereof by the Parent
Entities will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, require
consent under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or

Contract to which any of the Parent Entities is a party or by which any of

sole shareholder of Sub (which approval will occur immediately following

42  any applicable Laws or any judgments, orders, or decrees of any Governmental
Entity in each case applicable to the Parent Entities or any of their
respective properties, assets or rights, other than, in the case of clauses
(i), (ii) and (iv), as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.03 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies,
including all exhibits, schedules or amendments thereto, of the fully
executed (i) commitment letter, dated as of January 27, 2017, between Parent
and SFPI-FPIM, and the commitment letter, dated as of February 16, 2017,
between Parent and Wespavia SA (the " _Equity Commitment Letters_ "),
pursuant to which each of SFPI-FPIM and Wespavia SA has committed, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to invest in and/or
advance to Parent the cash amounts set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters
(the " _Equity Financing_ "), and (ii) commitment letter, dated as of the date
of this Agreement, among Parent, ING Bank N.V., BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV and
ING Belgium SA/NV (the " _Debt Commitment Letter,_ " and together with the
Equity Commitment Letters, the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which
the Lender Parties have committed, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, to lend to Parent the amounts set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Debt Financing_ " and together with the Equity
Financing, the " _Financing_ ").

 

(b) None of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified prior to
the date of this Agreement, and, as of the date of this Agreement, the
respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been
modified, withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. As of the date
hereof, except for (i) the fee letter among Parent and ING Bank N.V., as
coordinator and ING Belgium SA/NV as original underwriter (the " _Debt Fee
Letter_ ") and (ii) the Financing Commitments, there are no other agreements,
side letters or arrangements to which any of the Parent Entities is a party
relating to the funding or investing of the Financing. As of the date hereof,
the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and constitute the
legally valid and binding obligations of Parent, as applicable, and, to the
knowledge of Parent, the other parties to the Financing Commitments subject,
as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency and other Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and to
general equity principles (whether considered in a proceeding on equity or at
law). There are no conditions precedent between Parent on the one hand, and
any other party to the Financing Commitments or the Debt Fee Letter, on the
other hand, related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other
than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments. Assuming (i) the
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and
correct (without regard, in the case of the representations contained in 
_Section_ __ _ 4.07_ (No Undisclosed Liabilities), to any qualification by or
reference to "Company Material Adverse Effect"), (ii) the Company has
performed and complied with its covenants under this Agreement, (iii) the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied and (iv) the
Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments, the proceeds
to be disbursed pursuant to the agreements contemplated by the
Financing Commitments, in the aggregate, will be sufficient for Parent to
pay, or cause to be paid, the Merger Consideration and all related fees and
expenses at the Closing and to provide for any required repayment or
refinancing of Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries. As of the
date hereof, no event has occurred which would result in any breach or
violation of or constitute a default (or an event

 



43  which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) by Parent
under the Financing Commitments, or give rise to circumstances which would
mean that one or more conditions precedent under the Financing Commitments
would not or could not as of the Closing Date be satisfied, and Parent does
not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
Commitments will not be timely satisfied or that the Financing will not be
available to Parent on the Closing Date. Parent has fully paid all commitment
fees and other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof
pursuant to the Financing Commitments and will pay, or cause to be paid, in
full all amounts due on or before the Closing Date.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein, the Parent Entities expressly acknowledge
and agree that their respective obligations to consummate the Transactions
are not subject to any condition or contingency with respect to receipt of the
Financing or any financing or funding by any third party.

 

Section 5.04 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
Litigation pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against the
Parent Entities, or any of their respective Affiliates that, individually or
in the aggregate, would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date
of this Agreement, there is no Order outstanding against the Parent Entities,
or any of their respective Affiliates that, individually or in the aggregate,
would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.05 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of the Parent Entities or any of their Subsidiaries
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at
the date it is first mailed to the shareholders of the Company and at the time
of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading.

 

Section 5.06 _Operation and Ownership of Sub_. Sub has been formed solely for
the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and, prior to the Effective Time,
will not have engaged in any business activities, other than activities
pursuant to this Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and
matters ancillary thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, Intermediate
Co owns, and at the Effective Time Intermediate Co and/or one or more
Subsidiaries of Parent will own, beneficially and of record, all the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Sub, free and clear of all Liens.

 

Section 5.07 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person, other than Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
LLC, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, is entitled to any
brokers, finders or financial advisors fee or commission in connection with
the Merger or the other Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on
behalf of the Parent Entities or their Affiliates.

Section 5.08 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. None of the Parent Entities
or any of their Affiliates beneficially own (within the meaning of Section 13

Proposals, including by providing information (including non-public

(b) Except as may relate to any Qualified Purchaser (but only for as long as
such Person or group is a Qualified Purchaser) or as expressly permitted by
this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, after the Go-Shop Period End Date until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement, the Company
shall not and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and the Company shall
direct its and their Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way
of providing information) the submission or making of any requests,

Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person with
respect to, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to result in any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) except as expressly
permitted by _Section 6.02(f)_ , approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve, endorse or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal, or enter
into any confidentiality agreement, merger agreement, letter of intent,
agreement in principle, purchase agreement, option agreement or other

release, modify or fail to enforce any provision of, or grant any permission,

Approval, to the extent the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that failure to
take any of such actions under this clause (iv) would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the holders of Company Common
Stock under applicable Law), or (v) publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing. Except as may relate to any Qualified Purchaser or as expressly
permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, the Company shall, shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall cause its and their Representatives to immediately
cease and terminate, any solicitation, knowing encouragement, discussion or
negotiation or cooperation with, or assistance or participation in, or
facilitation of any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations
with, any Persons conducted heretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries and
its and their

 



49  Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and promptly
request and instruct the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to any such Person, and the Company shall
take all reasonably necessary actions to secure its rights and ensure the
performance of any such Persons obligations under any applicable
confidentiality agreement. The Company shall ensure that its Representatives
are aware of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, and any violation
of the restrictions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ by its Board of
Directors (including any committee thereof) or its Representatives (to the
extent such Representatives have been directed or authorized by the Company or
its Board of Directors to take or fail to take such action in violation of
such restrictions) shall be deemed to be a breach of this  _Section_ __ _
6.02_ by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that any actions taken by the
Companys Board of Directors (including any committee thereof) or its
Representatives that would be deemed a breach of the first two sentences of
this _Section 6.02(b)_ had the Company taken such action shall be deemed a
breach by the Company solely for purposes of determining whether an
Acquisition Proposal resulted from a breach of the first two sentences of
this  _Section 6.02(b)_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.02(b)_ or
any other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time following the Go-Shop
Period End Date and prior to the date and time on which Shareholder Approval
is obtained, (i) the Company has received an unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith to be _bona fide_ , (ii) such Acquisition Proposal
did not result in any material respect from a breach of the first two
sentences of _Section 6.02(b)_ , (iii) the Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that (x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take the
actions described in clauses (A) and (B) below would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, then the Company may (A) enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Company to the Person making
the Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company shall give written notice to Parent
after any such determination by the Board of Directors and before taking any
of the actions described in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B). The Company
shall concurrently provide Parent with copies of any information or materials
provided or made available to such other Person which was not previously made
available to Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the
occurrence of the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company may continue to engage
in the activities described in _Section 6.02(a)_ (subject to the limitations
and obligations set forth therein) with respect to, and the restrictions in
_Section 6.02(b)_ and _Section 6.02(c)_ shall not apply to, any Qualified
Purchaser (but only for so long as such Person or group is a Qualified
Purchaser), including with respect to any amended or modified Acquisition
Proposal submitted by any Qualified Purchaser following the Go-Shop Period End
Date.

(d) Except as may relate to a Qualified Purchaser, following the Go-Shop
Period End Date, the Company shall promptly notify Parent if it takes any
action described in clauses (A) and (B) of _Section 6.02(c)_ , which notice
shall include the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and
a copy of the Acquisition Proposal to which such action relates (if made in
writing) or the material terms and conditions thereof (if not made in
writing).

 



50  Except as may relate to a Qualified Purchaser, following the Go-Shop Period
End Date, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed (orally or
in writing) on a prompt basis (and in any event within forty-eight 48 hours)
of any material developments, material discussions or material negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal described in the immediately preceding
sentence and, upon the reasonable request of Parent, shall apprise Parent of
the status of any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto. None of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this
Agreement, enter into any agreement that would prohibit them from providing
such information or the information contemplated by the last sentence of
_Section 6.02(a)_ to Parent.

 

(e) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person relating to a possible
Acquisition Proposal subsequent to the date of this Agreement except for an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement as permitted or required pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.02_, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be party to any agreement that prohibits the Company from providing to
Parent any information provided or made available to any other Person pursuant
to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(f) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, and except as otherwise provided for in the
immediately following sentence, neither the Board of Directors of the Company
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify or publicly
propose to withdraw, qualify or modify in any manner the Recommendation; (ii)
if a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of capital stock of the Company
that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the shareholders
of the Company (including, for these purposes, by taking no position with
respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the
holders of Company Common Stock, which shall constitute a failure to
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer) within
ten (10) Business Days after commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act; (iii) approve or recommend or propose publicly to
approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend, or execute any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition or other agreement relating to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (any
of the actions specified in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Board
of Directors may at any time prior to the time Shareholder Approval has been
obtained, (A) effect a Change of Recommendation if, as a result of an event,
development or change in circumstances that first occurs, arises or becomes
known after the date of this Agreement (other than the receipt, existence or
terms of any Acquisition Proposal, which is subject to clause (B) below, or
any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof), the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that the failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the holders of
Company Common Stock under applicable Law or (B) effect a Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, in each case described in this clause (B),
with respect to a Superior Proposal, if (1) the Company receives a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors concludes in good
faith, after 

 



51  consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes
a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms
of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause (ii)
below, and (2) the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the holders of Company Common Stock under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case of the foregoing
clauses (A) and (B) the Board of Directors may not effect or make a Change of
Recommendation or, as applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 6.02(f)_ and _Section 8.01(f)_ unless, in the case of clause (B)
above, such Superior Proposal did not result in any material respect from
a breach by the Company of the first two sentences of _Section 6.02(b)_ ,
and, in the case of clauses (A) and (B) above:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to the Parent
Entities of its intention to effect or make a Change of Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement as contemplated by this _Section 6.02(f)_ at least
four Business Days in advance of taking such action (the " _Notice Period_ "),
which notice shall include, in the case of clause (B) above, an unredacted
copy of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person making
such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of
then-current form of all relevant transaction agreements relating to such
Superior Proposal (and any debt and equity financing materials related thereto
that were provided to the Company); and

 

(ii) prior to effecting or making a Change of Recommendation or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a proposed definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, (x) the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have
directed its Representatives to negotiate, during the Notice Period, with the
Parent Entities in good faith (to the extent the Parent Entities desire to
negotiate) to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
(y) the Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
any adjustments to this Agreement submitted in writing by the Parent Entities
during the Notice Period, and (z) the Board of Directors shall have determined
in good faith that, after giving effect to such adjustments, the Superior
Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal (in the case of clause (B)
above) or it would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the holders of Company Common Stock under applicable Law
to not effect a Change in Recommendation.

In the event of any material revision to the terms of any such Superior
Proposal or any Acquisition Proposal that the Companys Board of Directors
determines no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal, including any change in
any price term thereof, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to the Parent Entities and to again comply with the requirements of
this _Section 6.02(f)_ with respect to such new written notice, and a new
Notice Period shall commence with respect to such notice (except that the
reference to "four Business Days" in the definition of Notice Period shall
be deemed to be a reference to "two Business Days").

 



52 (g) Subject to the provision in this _Section 6.02(g)_ , nothing contained in
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company, the
Board of Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors from (i)
complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to shareholders in connection with the
making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), or (ii) making any
"stop-look-and-listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the shareholders of the Company); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any disclosure permitted under clause (i) of this _Section 6.02(g)_ shall
be deemed a Change of Recommendation unless it includes either an express
rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation
of the Recommendation. The Company shall not submit to the vote of its
shareholders any Acquisition Proposal or any Superior Proposal prior to the
termination of this Agreement.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

Person that is structured to permit such Person (other than the Parent

Board of Directors) of the assets (including capital stock of the Subsidiaries
of the Company) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis,

its Subsidiaries, (3) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any Person owning, directly or indirectly, shares

shares of the Company Common Stock or any other equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (4) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any Person (or the

merger or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or
such surviving entity, or (5) any recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution
or any other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its material
operating Subsidiaries, other than, in each case, the Transactions.

the Company or any of its Representatives has received prior to the Go-Shop
Period End Date a written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith (such determination to be made no later than

with outside counsel and its financial advisors, is or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal.

 



53 (iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result in any material respect from a violation of the
first two sentences of _Section 6.02(b)_ that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors) (x) is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms and the financing of which is fully committed or
reasonably likely to be obtained, and (y) would be more favorable to the
shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger,
taking into account all terms and conditions thereof (including all financial,
legal, financing, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal

and of this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by the Parent Entities pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(f)_);
_provided_ , that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the

respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or
the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall
provide the Parent Entities and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Proxy Statement (including any amendments or revisions
thereto) and all other materials used in connection with the Shareholders
Meeting that (i) constitute "proxy materials" or "solicitation materials" as
those terms are used in Rules 14a-1 through 14a-17 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) are otherwise used for the "solicitation" of "proxies" as
those terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act, in
each case prior to the filing thereof with the SEC or the dissemination
thereof to the Companys shareholders and shall give good faith consideration
to any comments made by Parent or its counsel, but the Company shall not be
obligated to incorporate any such comment.

 



54 (b) _Covenants of Parent with Respect to the Proxy Statement_. Parent shall
provide to the Company all information concerning the Parent Entities as may
be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement
and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation
of the Proxy Statement and resolution of comments of the SEC or its staff
related thereto. Each of the Parent Entities will furnish to the Company the
information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement
promptly following request therefor from the Company.

(c) _Mailing of Proxy Statement_. The Company, acting through the Board of
Directors, shall, as promptly as practicable after the SEC, orally or in
writing, confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement (or
the SEC notifies the Company that it does not intend to review the
Proxy Statement or any waiting period during which the SEC may comment on the
Proxy Statement expires), (x) establish a record date (if not previously
established) for and give notice of a meeting of its shareholders, for the
purpose of voting upon the approval of this Agreement (the " _Shareholders 
Meeting_"), and (y) mail to the holders of Company Common Stock as of the
record date established for the Shareholders Meeting the Proxy Statement
in definitive form (the date the Company elects to take such action or is
required to take such action, the " _Proxy Date_ "). The Company shall duly
call, convene and hold the Shareholders Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date, _provided_ , that in no event
shall such meeting be held later than 35 calendar days following the date the
Proxy Statement is mailed to the Companys shareholders and any postponements
or adjournments of such meetings shall require the prior written consent of
the Parent unless (i) the postponement or adjournment is required to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure which the SEC or its staff has instructed the Company is
necessary under applicable Law or which the Company in good faith believes is
otherwise required under applicable Law and is permitted under _Section
6.02(g)(i)_ , and to permit such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Companys shareholders prior to the
Shareholders Meeting, (ii) the postponement or adjournment is in order to
solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder
Approval or (iii) as of the time for which the Shareholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Shareholders Meeting. Once the Company has established a record date for the
Shareholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Shareholders Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable Law or
the Companys bylaws. Unless the Board of Directors shall have withdrawn,
modified or qualified its Recommendation thereof or otherwise effected a
Change of Recommendation, in each case in accordance with _Section 6.02(f)_ ,
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts, consistent with customary
practice, to solicit proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and
shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Shareholders
Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws and all rules of
Nasdaq. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the approval of this
Agreement and the Transactions (including the Merger) shall be the only matter
(other than procedural matters) which the Company shall propose to be acted on
by the shareholders of the Company at the Shareholders Meeting. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has been
terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, the Company shall submit the
Merger and this Agreement for the approval of the shareholders at
the Shareholders Meeting whether or not a Change of Recommendation shall
have occurred or an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or
otherwise made known to the Company, its Board of Directors, its
Representatives or its shareholders.

 



55 (d) _Amendments to Proxy Statement_. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their respective officers or directors should be
discovered by the Company which, pursuant to the Securities Act or Exchange
Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, they shall promptly inform Parent. Each of the Parent Entities and
the Company agree to correct any information provided by it for use in the
Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading. Each of
the Company and Parent shall cause all documents that such party is
responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger to comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

(e) _Other_. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that its obligations
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ shall not (except as provided in
_Section 6.02(f)_ ) be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company or any other Person of an
Acquisition Proposal.

Section 6.04 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company, on the
one hand, and the Parent Entities, on the other hand, shall, and shall cause

to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on
such parties or their Subsidiaries with respect to the Transactions,

parties to obtain) any consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity that is required to be obtained by them
or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions
as promptly as practicable, and to comply with the terms and conditions of any
such consent, authorization, Order or approval. Parent shall bear 100% of the
filing fees payable to the FTC, the Antitrust Division, CFIUS or any
other Governmental Entity in connection with the antitrust, competition or
trade regulation matters contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing (but subject to
_Section 6.04(f)_ ), each of the Parent Entities, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, undertakes and agrees to file (i) within fifteen
(15) Business Days following the date hereof, a Notification and Report Form
under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_
") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice
(the " _Antitrust Division_ "), and (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof, such other filings with any other Governmental Entities
as may be required under any other applicable 

 



56  Antitrust Laws, to the extent set forth on Section 6.04(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Each of the Parent Entities and the Company, as
applicable, shall (x) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or
requests for additional information or documentation received from the FTC,
the Antitrust Division or such other Governmental Entity, and (y) not extend
any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws or enter
into any agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any such other
Governmental Entity not to consummate the Transactions, except with the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) In furtherance of and not in limitation of _Sections 6.04(a)_ and _Section
6.04(b)_ and subject to  _Section 6.04(g)_ , Parent and the Company shall use

final notice with CFIUS regarding the Merger pursuant to the DPA as promptly

timely respond to any questions posed by CFIUS during the pre-filing period or
CFIUSs review or investigation of the Merger.

 

(i) Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take any and all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain CFIUS Approval as soon as is
practicable and feasible, in accordance with the CFIUS timetable.

 

(ii) Parent and the Company shall each use reasonable best efforts to promptly
provide all necessary information for the CFIUS Filing, to complete the CFIUS
Filing in a timely manner and to timely respond to any requests by CFIUS for
additional information, and shall each use reasonable best efforts to keep the
other generally apprised of communications with, and requests for additional
information from CFIUS. Subject to applicable Law or requests of CFIUS, Parent
and the Company shall provide each others counsel with an opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, the CFIUS Filing and any written communications or
submissions, and with respect to any such notification, filing, written
communication or submission, any documents submitted therewith to CFIUS;
_provided_ , that materials may be redacted or withheld (A) as necessary to
comply with contractual agreements and applicable Law, (B) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns (it being understood
that trade secrets or other confidential intellectual property shall be
shared between the parties on an outside counsel only basis) and (C) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries (it
being understood that the terms of this proviso shall in no way limit the
information that would be required by this Agreement to be shared with CFIUS
or any other Governmental Entity). Subject to applicable Law, the reasonable
requests of CFIUS and timing considerations, the Company and Parent will
consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of the Company or Parent relating
to CFIUS proceedings.

 



57 (iii) As consistent with any CFIUS requests for confidentiality, each party
shall cooperate and each party shall have the opportunity to attend (or have
its representatives participate) in any meetings with CFIUS member agencies,
attend any on-site visit by CFIUS member agencies to a partys facility (if
requested by a CFIUS member agency), and take any other commercially
reasonable action in furtherance of the CFIUS Approval.

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 6.04(a)_ and _Section
6.04(b)_ and subject to _Section 6.04(f)_ , the Company shall timely submit
the appropriate 60-day Pre Notification and 5-day Notification (the " _ITAR
Filing_ ") to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (" _DDTC_ ") of ITAR,
in compliance with ITAR §122.4(a)-(b). The Company shall draft and submit the
ITAR Filing, but shall permit Parent to review, prior to submission, the ITAR
Filing and the Company shall consider in good faith the written comments of
Parent on the ITAR Filing and all documents and submission materials relating
thereto. Parent and the Company hereby agree promptly to provide and cause
their respective Affiliates to provide to the other party or to the DDTC, as
appropriate, all information and other assistance necessary to prepare and
timely submit the ITAR Filing in accordance with this _Section 6.04(d)_ and to
respond to any questions posed by DDTC.

 

(e) Subject to applicable Law and _Section 6.04(a)_ , Company and Parent shall
promptly furnish to each other copies of any notices or written
communications received by it or any of its Affiliates from any third party or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, and Company and
Parent shall permit each others counsel an opportunity to review and
comment thereon in advance, and shall consider in good faith the comments of
such counsel in connection with, any proposed written communications by the
Company or Parent, respectively, and/or its Affiliates to any third party or
any Governmental Entity, including the FTC, the Antitrust Division and CFIUS,
concerning the Transactions. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to provide
the other party and its counsel the opportunity, on reasonable advance notice,
to participate in any substantive meetings or discussions, either in person
or by telephone, between the Company or Parent, respectively, and/or any of
its Affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and any third party or
Governmental Entity, including the FTC, the Antitrust Division and CFIUS, on
the other hand, concerning or in connection with the Transactions, to the
extent such participation is permitted by such third party or Governmental
Entity.

 

(f) At the written request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, hold
separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the
businesses, services or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
_provided_ that any such action shall not be effective for any purpose until
after the Closing, shall not affect any of the other provisions of this
Agreement (including any representations or warranties herein, indemnification
rights or obligations or adjustments to the purchase price) and shall be
conditioned in all respects upon the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not agree,
commit or consent to any of such actions with respect to itself or any of its
Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Parent.

 



58 (g) Parent and the Company will use joint efforts in devising and implementing
the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition or CFIUS
clearances. Each party shall consult with the other party and consider in good
faith the views of the other party in devising and implementing the strategy
for obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition or CFIUS clearances and
prior to entering into any agreement, arrangement, undertaking or
understanding with any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Law or
the DPA.

 

(h) The Company and Parent shall give (or cause its respective Subsidiaries to
give) any notices to third parties (other than Governmental Entities), and
use, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any consents from third parties (other than Governmental Entities) that
are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions; 
_provided_ , _however_ (but without limiting the foregoing obligation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to use their respective reasonable best efforts
to obtain such consent), neither the failure to obtain any such consents or
the termination of any Contract as a result thereof shall, by itself or in
combination with other such failures or terminations, result in the failure of
any condition set forth in Article VII. In the event that either party shall
fail to obtain any third party consent described in the first sentence of
this _Section 6.04(h)_ , each of the parties shall cooperate to minimize any
adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and
their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected
to result, after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with
obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than any
Governmental Entity) with respect to the Transactions, (i) without the prior
written consent of Parent, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being
solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any
liability or other obligation due to such Person and (ii) none of the Parent
Entities shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose
approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any
approval or consent from any Person (other than any Governmental Entity) with
respect to the Transactions, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any
commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such Person;
_provided_ , that Parent shall reimburse the Company for any payments made
with Parents prior written consent in accordance with this  _Section
6.04(h)_ prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company shall, upon the direction
of the Parent Entities and subject to prompt reimbursement by Parent, so
pay or commit to pay all such amounts required.

Section 6.05 _Takeover Law_. If any Takeover Law shall become or is deemed to
be applicable to the Merger or the other Transactions after the date of this
Agreement, the Company and Parent and the members of their respective boards
of directors (or equivalent governing body) shall grant such approvals and use
its reasonable best efforts to take such actions necessary so that the Merger
and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate if possible, and
otherwise to minimize, the effects of such Takeover Law on the Merger and the
other Transactions and this Agreement.

 



59 Section 6.06 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statement with respect to the
Merger or the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or
public statement prior to such consultation, except as otherwise may be
required by applicable Law, court process or Nasdaq rule, regulation or
listing agreement. The parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions shall be in the
form mutually agreed to by the parties.

Section 6.07 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Person
who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, a director or officer of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Companys Organizational Documents,
the Organizational Documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and, for a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time, shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of
any such Indemnified Party.

(b) Without limiting _Section 6.07(a)_ , from and after the Effective Time,
in the event of any threatened or actual claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (a " _Claim_ "), whether civil, criminal or administrative,
based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director
(including in a capacity as a member of any board committee), or officer of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors
or (ii) this Agreement or any of the Transactions, whether in any case
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest
extent permitted by Law and the Companys or its applicable Subsidiarys
Organizational Documents in effect at the Effective Time, each such
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, Damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation of each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law and the Companys or
its applicable Subsidiarys Organizational Documents in effect at the
Effective Time upon receipt of any undertaking from such Indemnified Party
contemplated by applicable Law or such Organizational Documents with respect
to repayment of advancement), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
of or in connection with any such threatened or actual Claim. Parents and the
Surviving Corporations obligations under this _Section 6.07(b)_ shall
continue in full force and effect for a period or six (6) years after from
the Effective Time provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any Claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until
the final disposition of such Claim.

 

(c) The Company shall obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or
"tail") directors and officers liability insurance policies in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years
from the Effective Time, covering each person who is covered by such policies
on the date of this Agreement, and the individuals set 

 



60  forth on Section 6.07(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule for their
services disclosed on such schedule, on terms with respect to such coverage
and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than those of such policies in
effect on the date of this Agreement; such tail policy may not be amended,
modified or cancelled or revoked by the Company, Parent, Intermediate Co or
the Surviving Corporation. In the event the Company does not obtain such
"tail" insurance policies, then, for a period of six years from the Effective
Time, Parent and Intermediate Co shall maintain in effect the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance policies in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
Indemnified Party on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less
favorable in the aggregate than those of such policies in effect on the date
of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent, Intermediate
Co nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual
premium for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the annual premium
paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year for such
insurance (which amount the Company represents and warrants is set forth in
Section 6.07(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter); and _provided_ , _further_
, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Parent, Intermediate Co or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, in the event that the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or a substantial portion of its stock, properties or assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation, Intermediate
Co or Parent, respectively, shall cause proper provision to be made so that
the successors or assigns or transferees, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.07_.

(e) From and after the Effective Time (but not prior thereto), the provisions
of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.07_ (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or
her Representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by Contract or otherwise.

Section 6.08 _Access; Confidentiality_.

(a) During the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) afford to Parent, and to
Parents Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours and
on reasonable notice to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties, books and
records and to those directors, officers and employees of the Company to whom
Parent reasonably requests access, (ii) furnish, as promptly as practicable,
to Parent all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business,
properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel, books and records and
financial information and other aspects of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent may reasonably request, (iii) reasonably cooperate with Parent and its
Representatives to organize and facilitate meetings among Parent and its
Representatives and the Companys Representatives to be located at the
properties, offices or other facilities of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries at such times during normal business hours as Parent may
reasonably request, (iv) use reasonable best efforts to furnish or produce
information related to the financial or Tax records of the Company and its

 



61  Subsidiaries if reasonably requested by Parent or its Representatives and
(v) reasonably cooperate with Parent and Parents Representatives with respect
to communications to, and to organize and facilitate meetings with,
customers, suppliers and other key business relations of the Company and each
Subsidiary of the Company as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide any such access
or information to the extent that doing so, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, would (A) cause a waiver of an attorney-client privilege or loss of
attorney work product protection or (B) constitute a violation of any
applicable Law (including Antitrust Laws) (in each case, it being agreed that
the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding
such access or information and thereafter the Company and Parent shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such access or
information, as applicable, to be provided, or made available, in a manner
that would not reasonably be expected to cause such a waiver or violation).

 

(b) All information received from the Company or its Representatives under
_Section 6.08(a)_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.09 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each party hereto shall give
prompt written notice to the other of (a) any Litigation arising out of or
relating to the Transactions or (b) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any
change, effect, event, change in circumstance, occurrence or discovery of any
fact that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger set
forth in Article VII not to be satisfied; _provided_ that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ shall not cure any breach of
any representation or warranty, breach of covenant or failure to satisfy the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement or otherwise
limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice; _provided_ _further_ , that failure to give prompt notice pursuant to
clause (b) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ shall not constitute a failure of
a condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger set forth in
Article VII except to the extent that the underlying fact or circumstance not
so notified standing alone constitutes such a failure.

 

Section 6.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) The Parent Entities shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Commitments, including using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments,
in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof (it being
further understood and agreed that Parent may not amend, supplement, modify or
waive any provision of Financing Commitments in any way that would reasonably
be expected to adversely impact or delay in any material respect the ability
of the Parent Entities to consummate the Merger in accordance with this
Agreement or the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Commitments as in effect on the date hereof), (ii) timely negotiate
all definitive documents evidencing the Financing, timely satisfy all
conditions to the Financing and otherwise consummate the Financing at or prior
to the Closing, and (iii) enforce the Financing Commitments. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (including the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 6.10(a)_ ), in no event shall the obligations of
the Parent Entities hereunder be construed to require any Parent Entity or
any of their Affiliates to enforce by litigation any of its rights pursuant to
the Debt Financing Commitment or otherwise against any of Parents Debt
Financing sources.

 



62 (b) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to obtain and consummate the
Debt Financing. Parent shall furnish correct and complete copies of all
definitive agreements entered into by Parent (or any of the Parent Entities)
with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter to the Company promptly upon their
execution, _provided_ that the same pricing terms, fee amounts and economic
terms redacted from the Debt Fee Letter provided to the Company may be
redacted from such definitive agreements. In the event any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the
flex provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, the Parent
Entities shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such
alternative Debt Financing, " _Alternative Debt Financing_ "); _provided_ ,
that any such Alternative Debt Financing shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
available on the Closing Date or the length of the commitment therefor, from
that contemplated by the Debt Financing Letter as in effect on the date
hereof, (ii) expand upon the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing as set
forth in the Debt Financing Letter as in effect on the date hereof or (iii) in
any way reasonably be expected to adversely impact or delay in any respect
the ability of Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger in accordance with this
Agreement or the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Commitments as in effect on the date hereof. Parent shall furnish
correct and complete copies of all definitive agreements relating to the
Alternative Debt Financing to the Company promptly upon their execution,
_provided_ that the pricing terms, fee amounts and economic terms
contained in the agreements governing the Alternative Debt Financing that
correspond to such terms that were redacted from the Debt Fee Letter provided
to the Company may also be redacted from such definitive agreements. Parent
shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to obtain and consummate the Alternative
Debt Financing. In the event Alternative Debt Financing is arranged in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(b)_, the term " _Financing
Commitments_ " shall mean the commitment letter(s) for such Alternative Debt
Financing.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing and as promptly as practicable following the date
hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries respective Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Parent, in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing or Alternative Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by
Parent. The Company will notify Parent of any material error, mistake or
omission in the information provided pursuant to this _Section 6.10(c)_ that
it becomes aware of and if requested by Parent will use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly correct such error, mistake or omission. Nothing
contained in this _Section 6.10(c)_ or otherwise shall require the Company to
be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Financing prior to the
Closing.

 

(d) Parent shall, regardless of whether the Closing shall occur, (i) indemnify
and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries from and against any
liability or obligation suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing or the Alternative Debt Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries provided by the
Company or

 



63  its Subsidiaries in writing specifically for use in the Financing offering
documents); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply in the event
of the Companys or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Representatives, willful misconduct or gross negligence and (ii) promptly
upon the Companys request, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-

terms thereof, accept for purchase and purchase all Existing Notes properly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to such Offer to Purchase; and

documents governing the Existing Notes. 

(j) The Company shall, and shall, as applicable, cause its Subsidiaries to,
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective
Representatives to:

redeem the Industrial Revenue Bonds (the " _IRB Redemption_ ") in accordance

obtain such consents or waivers of covenants, conditions or events of default
contained in the documents governing the Industrial Revenue Bonds as specified

Consents_ ");

 

(ii) take such actions and prepare and deliver all other documents as may be
necessary to effectuate the consents or waivers contemplated by the IRB
Consents and cause them to be operative no later than the Closing, and use

documents (including by delivering, or causing to be delivered, customary
legal opinions and certificates); and

(iii) take such actions and prepare and deliver all other documents
(including any customary officers certificates and legal opinions) as may be

68 Section 6.15 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee of the Company or

otherwise agreed in writing between Parent and a Company Employee, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for a
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary

employee benefit, employment compensation or similar plans, programs,
agreements or arrangements of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(e) Parent does not currently intend to cause the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending 90 days thereafter, to effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff"
(as those terms are defined in WARN) affecting in whole or in part any site of

compensation to employees, consultants and directors, including under the
Companys annual bonus plan and the ERP Implementation Team Bonus Program;
_provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall not apply to, or otherwise
impair, the rights of any employee under a written Contract between
such employee and the Company in effect on the date hereof and set forth on
__ Section 6.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (unless otherwise agreed in
writing by such employee).

 

Section 6.17 _2017 Cash Awards and Long Term Retention Awards_.

 

(a) The Company shall, at or prior to the Closing, grant cash awards to each
Executive who enters into an employment agreement with Parent at or prior to
the Effective Time, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,170,000, which
awards shall vest upon the Effective Time, subject to each Executives
continued employment with the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and be paid in cash as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time. The Company shall obtain acknowledgements by each Executive
receiving such an award that such cash award shall be in full satisfaction of
any obligations the Company has to issue Restricted Shares to such Executive
for 2017 under such Executives employment agreement with the Company.

 



70 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall, immediately following the Closing, offer
to specified employees who are not Executives or otherwise party to an
employment agreement with Parent, a retention award (each, a " _Retention
Award_ ") that will provide for a cash payout (to be specified in a separate
agreement) after 36 months of continued employment with the Surviving
Corporation following the Effective Time (the " _Retention Period_ "). Such
Retention Awards shall (i) be in the form of cash, (ii) vest upon the
completion of the Retention Period, and (iii) be paid in cash as soon as
reasonably practicable following completion of the Retention Period. In no
event shall the aggregate maximum payout of all Retention Awards exceed
$900,000. For any such employees covered under the Companys Legacy
Leadership Severance Policy, the retention agreements for such Retention
Awards shall contain an acknowledgment by each recipient that receiving a
Retention Award is consideration in lieu of any 2017 stock compensation to
such employee and shall not, in and of itself, give rise to "good reason"
under any applicable agreements, severance policies or arrangements.

 

(c) Notwithstanding _Sections 6.17(a)_ and _6.17(b)_ , the maximum payout for
each award shall in no event exceed $1.00 less than the amount that could
give rise to any "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code after taking into account all other payments or
benefits (including vesting of Restricted Shares) that are payable in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions (in each case, not
taking into account any events or payments that could arise following
consummation of the Transactions) and without treating such awards or any
other payments or benefits as reasonable compensation (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) for purposes of the calculations under
Section 280G of the Code.

 

Section 6.18 _401(k) Matching Contribution for 2016_. Prior to March 15, 2017,
the Company shall make the matching contribution payable by the Company to
the Company Profit Sharing Plan for the 2016 plan year. Such matching
contribution shall equal an amount not in excess of $1,522,458 and shall be
made in shares of Company Common Stock consistent with past practice, with
the shares of Company Common Stock being valued for such purpose at the
average of the high and low trading price for such shares on the date of
funding. The Company shall take such actions as are deemed necessary or
advisable to comply with any securities laws or other legal requirements
implicated by the issuance of Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.18_.

and assigns.

Section 9.11 _Entire Agreement; Benefit_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

 

(b) Neither this Agreement nor any other agreement contemplated hereby is
intended to or shall confer upon any person other than the parties hereto or
thereto any legal or equitable rights or remedies or benefits of any nature
whatsoever except, following the Effective Time, for the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 6.07_. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, (i) prior to the Effective Time, the Company on behalf of its
shareholders shall have the right to pursue Damages (including Damages based

(c) The representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement have been
made solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and (i) are
intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk
to one of the parties if those statements prove to be inaccurate; and (ii)
have been qualified by reference to the Company Disclosure Schedule
which contains certain disclosures that are not reflected in the text of this
Agreement.

Section 9.12 _Extension; Waiver_.

 

(a) At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto may (i) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other parties hereto, (ii) to the extent permitted by Law, waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein by any
other party or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant
hereto by any other applicable party or (iii) subject to the proviso to the
first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ and to the extent permitted by Law,
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.

 



84 (b) The failure of any party to this Agreement to exercise any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver by such party
of such right.

Section 9.13 _Disclosure Schedules_. All capitalized terms not defined in the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this
Agreement. Any disclosure set forth in one section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to and qualify
the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number
and each other Section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure is relevant to such
other Section or subsection. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule
relating to any possible breach or violation of any Contract or Law shall be
construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred.

 

Section 9.14 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or Section, such
reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated.

(b) The table of contents, headings and index of defined terms contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

(c) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and
effect of the word "shall". The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to
which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply
"if".

 

(d) All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when
used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant thereto
unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and
to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such
term. References to a person or Person are also to its permitted successors
and assigns.

(e) The phrase "made available," when used in reference to anything made
available to the Parent Entities or their Representatives shall be deemed to
mean that an unredacted copy of such document or other item of information was
provided or made available with printing and downloading access to Parent and
its Representatives in the Data Room at least 48 hours prior to the execution
of this Agreement.

 



85 (f) Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in
any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

(g) Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of
this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the
parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

(h) Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the
Effective Time, on the part of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires Sub to
take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on
the part of Parent and Intermediate Co to cause Sub to take such action.
