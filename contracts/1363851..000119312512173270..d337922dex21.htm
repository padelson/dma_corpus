(a) Provided that the opinions described in paragraph (c) below of this
_Section 1.08_ are received on or prior to the Closing Date, immediately
after the Effective Time Parent and US Corp. will cause the Surviving
Corporation to merge with and into Merger LLC (the " _Subsequent Merger_ "),
the separate corporate existence of the Surviving Corporation shall

 



2  thereupon cease, Merger LLC shall continue as the surviving entity (the "
_Surviving Company_ ") and all of the rights and obligations of the Surviving
Corporation under this Agreement shall be deemed the rights and obligations
of the Surviving Company in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware (the " _LLC Act_ ").
The Subsequent Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 18-209(g)
of the LLC Act.

(b) Provided that the opinions described in paragraph (c) below of this
_Section 1.08_ are received on or prior to the Closing Date, the parties
hereto intend that this Agreement will constitute a "plan of reorganization"
with respect to the Merger and Subsequent Merger for United States federal
income tax purposes pursuant to which, for such purposes, the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger, taken together, are to be treated as a "reorganization"
under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ ")
(to which each of Parent, US Corp. and the Company are to be parties under
Section 368(b) of the Code) in which the Company is to be treated as merging
directly with and into US Corp., with the Company Common Stock converted in
such merger into the right to receive the Merger Consideration provided for
hereunder in a conversion to which Section 367(a)(1) of the Code does not
apply.

(c) If, on or prior to the Closing Date, (i) the Company shall have received
the opinion of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy LLP, special counsel to the
Company, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger, taken together, should be treated for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, that each of Parent, US Corp. and the Company will be a party to that
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code, and that,
assuming the correctness of the foregoing conclusions, a conversion of Company
Common Stock into the Merger Consideration provided for hereunder will be an
exchange governed by Section 354 and Section 356 of the Code to which Section
367(a)(1) of the Code does not apply (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "), and
(ii) Parent shall have received the opinion of Sidley Austin LLP, special
counsel to Parent, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that none of
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, US Corp., Parent or Merger LLC will
recognize income or gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
the Subsequent Merger, then the Subsequent Merger shall occur in accordance
with _Section 1.08(a)_ and each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, treat the Merger, Subsequent Merger and the conversion of
Company Common Stock into the Merger Consideration provided hereunder for all
Tax purposes consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment. The opinions of
counsel referred to above may be based on customary assumptions and
representations, including representations of the Company and Parent. Each of
the Company and Parent shall request its respective counsel to render an
opinion to the effect described above. In the event that either partys
counsel is unable to render an opinion to the effect described above, such
counsel shall (at the request of the other party) provide a written
explanation of the substantive reason or reasons causing such counsel to be
unable to do so. To the extent that either of such opinions is not received
in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 1.08(c)_, then
the Subsequent Merger shall not occur and each of the parties hereto shall,
and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, treat the Merger for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a taxable acquisition of the Company
Common Stock by US Corp. in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 



3 ARTICLE II

_Effect on the Capital Stock of the_

_Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

(a) The issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be
converted into and become 14.4 million fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Series A 5.9% Convertible Preferred Stock of the Surviving Corporation. In
exchange for, and in consideration of, Parent delivering the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to the Exchange Agent on behalf of US
Corp. and Merger Sub in accordance with  _Section 2.02_ and the payment by
US Corp. to the Surviving Corporation of $10.00 (or such other amount as is
agreed by US Corp. and the Surviving Corporation), the Surviving Corporation
will issue to US Corp. 33.8 million fully paid and nonassessable shares (or
such other number of shares as is agreed to by the Surviving Corporation and
US Corp.) of common stock, par value $100.00 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent,
US Corp., Merger Sub, Merger LLC or any of their respective wholly-owned
subsidiaries shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no Parent Common Stock or
other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, US Corp., Merger Sub, Merger LLC or the holders of
any securities of the Company, US Corp., Merger Sub or Merger LLC:

(i) Subject to  _Sections 2.01(b)_, _2.01(c)(ii)_ and _2.01(d)_ , each
issued and outstanding share (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance
with _Section 2.01(b)_ and any Appraisal Shares (to the extent provided in 
_Section 2.01(d))_) of Company Common Stock shall automatically be converted
into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the combination of
(x) $28.00 in cash without interest (the " _Per Share Cash Amount_ ") and (y)
0.6606 of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Parent
Common Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in _Section 2.01(c)(ii)_, the
" _Exchange Ratio_ ").

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock or the securities convertible into
or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by
reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment,
or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the Per Share Cash Amount, the Exchange

 



4  Ratio and the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event.

(iii) The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued, and cash payable, upon
the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Section
2.01(c)_ and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as
contemplated by _Section 2.02(e)_ are referred to collectively as " _Merger
Consideration_ ". As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Book-Entry Shares (either case being referred to in this Agreement, to the
extent applicable, as a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive, in accordance with _Section
2.02_, the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate, without
interest.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares ("
_Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled
to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Appraisal Shares pursuant to,
and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section
262_ ") shall not be converted into the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.01(c)_, but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be
entitled to payment by the Surviving Corporation of the fair market value of
such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262; _provided_ , _however_
, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair market value of such holders Appraisal
Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall have become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.01(c)_. The Company shall serve prompt written notice to Parent of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent (on behalf of US Corp. and Merger Sub)
shall deposit with a nationally recognized financial institution designated
by Parent (on behalf of US Corp. and Merger Sub) and reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock whose shares are converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ , for exchange
in accordance with this _Article II_ , through the Exchange Agent, shares of
Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book entry form
unless a physical certificate is requested) issuable pursuant to _Section
2.01_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall provide to the Exchange Agent all of the
cash necessary to pay the cash portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration
for the

 



5  shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01_ and shall, after the
Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or
cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other
distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.02(c)_ (such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash provided to
the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other distributions with
respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").
For the purposes of such deposit, Merger Sub shall assume that there will not
be any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Merger Sub shall make
available to the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time
to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this _Section 2.02_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose.

(b) Parent (on behalf of US Corp. and Merger Sub) shall instruct the Exchange
Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, to
each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_, (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent (on behalf of US Corp. and Merger Sub) may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent (on behalf of US Corp. and
Merger Sub), together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (A) the Per Share Cash Amount with respect to which the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ into the
right to receive, (B) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in non-certificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested) which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant
to _Section 2.01(c)_ into the right to receive and (C) cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in _Section 2.02(e)_,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and shares may be
issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Subject to the last sentence of _Section 2.02(c)_, until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.02_, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_. No interest shall be paid or accrue
on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 



6 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any certificate formerly representing Company Common Stock with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to _Section 2.02(e)_, in each case until the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.02(e)_ and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

(d) The Merger Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall
be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. After the Effective Time
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock
are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
II_.

 

(e) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.01_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. For
purposes of this _Section 2.02(e)_, all fractional shares to which a single
record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be
rounded to three decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each
holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to
such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without
interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (A) the
amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled under _Section 2.01(c)_ (or would be entitled
but for this _Section 2.02(e)_) and (B) an amount equal to the average of the
closing sale prices of the Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq for each of the
five (5) trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date. As soon as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests
in Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts,
without interest, to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive
such cash.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Company Common Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent (on behalf of the Surviving Corporation), upon demand,
and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with
this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent (on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation) for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration and
any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as
contemplated by _Section 2.02(c)(ii)_.

 



7 (g) None of Parent, US Corp., Merger Sub, Merger LLC, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange
Fund (including any amounts delivered to Parent in accordance with _Section
2.02(f)_) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered
prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which Merger Consideration or any dividends or distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by _Section 2.02(c)(i)_
in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent (on
behalf of US Corp. and Merger Sub), the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common
Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions that would be
payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

 

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent (on behalf of Merger Sub), on a daily basis; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of cash in the Exchange Fund shall in all
events be limited to investment in direct short-term obligations of, or short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United
States government, or in funds investing solely in such obligations, and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Article II_. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Merger Sub. If for any
reason (including losses) the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts
to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled under
this  _Article II_ , Parent shall take all steps necessary to promptly
deposit with the Exchange Agent additional Merger Consideration or other cash
sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and Parent
shall in any event be liable for payment thereof.

(j) Parent (on behalf of Merger Sub) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable in respect of the Transactions such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state,
federal, provincial, territorial, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority, such amounts shall be treated as paid to the Persons otherwise
entitled to such amounts. If the amount withheld and paid over is in respect
of consideration other than cash, the Surviving Corporation

 



8  or other payor will be treated as though it withheld an appropriate amount
of the type of consideration otherwise payable to the Person entitled to such
amount, sold such consideration on behalf of such Person for an amount of
cash equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such
deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority.

Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company, subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval. The Company has duly executed and delivered
this Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent, US Corp., Merger Sub and Merger LLC of this Agreement, this Agreement
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it

by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations or book
reserve to be less than such projected benefit obligations and (ii) each Non-

Company or any of its Affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such
term is defined in U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any
Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, either alone or together
with any other event, could be characterized as a "parachute payment" (as

thereunder and of the Canadian securities regulatory authorities applicable to
such Parent Publicly Filed Document, and did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(c) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent
Publicly Filed Documents (including, in each case, any notes or schedules
thereto) and all related compilations, reviews and other reports issued by

Canadian securities Laws. Parents disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes
under the Exchange Act and applicable Canadian securities Laws is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC and the Canadian securities regulatory authorities,
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to Parents

employees who have a significant role in Parents internal control over
financial reporting.

is made to the Company by a Third Party and such Company Takeover Proposal is
not withdrawn and the Company has complied with this _Section 5.02_ in all
material respects; (ii) such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior

written notice of the Company Boards intention to take such action, which
notice

 



53  shall include the information with respect to such Superior Company Proposal
that is specified in _Section 5.02(b)_ (it being agreed that neither the

Law shall constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless and until
the Company shall have failed at or prior to the end of the period referred
to in _clause (v)_ below (and, upon the occurrence of such failure, such
notice and such public announcement shall constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change) to publicly announce that the Company Board (A) was
expressly reaffirming the Company Recommendation and Company Determination and
(B) has determined that such other Company Takeover Proposal (after taking
into account any modifications or adjustments made to this Agreement,
the Financing Letter, the Financing and the Transactions and agreed to by the
parties hereto and any modifications or adjustments made to such other Company
Takeover Proposal) is not a Superior Company Proposal and has publicly
rejected such Company Takeover Proposal); (v) during such five (5) Business
Day period, the Company and its Representatives have negotiated in good faith
with Parent regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement, the
Financing Letter, the Financing and the Transactions proposed by Parent in
response to such Superior Company Proposal; (vi) at the end of the five (5)
Business Day period described in the foregoing _clause (v)_ (and taking into
account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement, the
Financing Letter, the Financing and the Transactions proposed by Parent) the
Company Takeover Proposal continues to be a Superior Company Proposal and the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors that the failure to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the exercise by the
Company Board of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Laws; and (vii) concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement, the Company pays Parent the Company Termination Fee. Any material
amendment or modification to any Superior Company Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any change in the consideration to be received is
a material modification) will be deemed to be a new Company Takeover Proposal
for purposes of this _Section 5.02_; _provided_ , _however_ , that with
respect to each and every material amendment or modification, the notice
period and the period during which the Company and its Representatives are
required to negotiate in good faith with Parent regarding any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement, the Financing Letter, the Financing and the
Transactions pursuant to _clause (v)_ above shall expire on the second (2nd)
Business Day after the Company Board provides written notice of such new
Company Takeover Proposal to Parent.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board,
in circumstances not involving or relating to a Company Takeover Proposal,
from effecting prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change of the type described in _clause (A)_ of the
definition thereof in response to the occurrence of a Company Intervening
Event if (and only if): (i) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws; (ii) the Company provides
Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice describing the
Company Intervening Event and advising Parent that the Company Board intends
to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail
(it being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by the Company nor
any public announcement thereof that the Company Board determines that it is
required to make under applicable Law

 



54  shall constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless and until
the Company shall have failed at or prior to the end of the period referred to
in _clause (iii)_ below (and, upon the occurrence of such failure, such
notice and such public announcement shall constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change) to publicly announce that the Company Board (A) was
expressly reaffirming the Company Recommendation and the Company
Determination and (B) has determined that such Company Intervening Event
(after taking into account any modifications or adjustments made to this
Agreement, the Financing Letter, the Financing and the Transactions and agreed
to by the parties hereto) no longer exists); (iii) during such five (5)
Business Day period, the Company and its Representatives have negotiated in
good faith with Parent regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement,
the Financing Letter, the Financing and the Transactions proposed by Parent
in response to such Company Intervening Event; and (iv) at the end of the five
(5) Business Day period described in the foregoing _clause (iii)_ , the
Company Board again concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel (and taking into account any adjustment or modification
of the terms of this Agreement, the Financing Letter, the Financing and the
Transactions proposed by Parent), that a Company Intervening Event continues
to exist and that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with the exercise by the Company Board of its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws. 

(g) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of
the Effective Time and the date of termination of this Agreement, the Company
shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality agreement relating to a Company Takeover Proposal or
standstill agreement to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
is a party (other than any involving Parent). During such period, the Company
agrees to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the
provisions of any such agreements, including obtaining injunctions to prevent
any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof in any court of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction.

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be determined to be inconsistent with applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) any disclosure of a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, an express rejection
of any applicable Company Takeover Proposal or an express reaffirmation of
the Company Recommendation, shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and (B) neither the Company nor the Company Board (nor
any committee thereof) shall make any Company Adverse Recommendation Change
except in accordance with the other provisions of this _Section 5.02_.

 



55 (i) _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Company Acquisition Transaction_ " means any transaction or series of
related transactions other than the Merger and the Subsequent Merger
involving: (i) any acquisition or purchase by any Third Party of more than 20%
of the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries; (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Third Party beneficially owning more than 20%
of the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries; (iii) any merger, amalgamation, plan of
arrangement, consolidation, business combination, share exchange,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company or any Company
Subsidiary pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company immediately
preceding such transaction hold less than 80% of the equity interests in the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (iv) any direct or indirect
acquisition of any business or businesses or of assets (including equity
interests in any Company Subsidiary) that constitute or account for 20% or
more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets (based on the fair
market value thereof) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a

good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its outside
financial advisors and its outside legal counsel, taking into account relevant
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal, the identity of the
Third Party making such proposal and the conditions for completion of such
proposal (A) is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the
stockholders of the Company than the Merger and the Subsequent Merger,
taken together, taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such proposal or otherwise) and
(B) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms set forth in the

during which Parent and its Representatives are required to negotiate in good
faith with the Company regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
and the Transactions pursuant to _clause (v)_ above shall expire on the
second (2nd) Business Day after the Parent Board provides written notice of
such new Parent Takeover Proposal to the Company.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Parent Board, in
circumstances not involving or relating to a Parent Takeover Proposal, from
effecting prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change of the type described in _clause (A)_ of the
definition thereof in response to the occurrence of a Parent Intervening
Event, if (and only if): (i) the Parent Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of Parent under applicable Laws; (ii) Parent provides the Company
at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice describing Parent
Intervening Event and advising the Company that the Parent Board intends to
take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail (it
being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by Parent nor any public
announcement thereof that the Parent Board determines that it is required to
make under applicable Law shall constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change unless and until Parent shall have failed at or prior to the end of the
period referred to in _clause (iii)_ below (and, upon the occurrence of such
failure, such notice and such public announcement shall constitute a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change) to publicly announce that the Parent Board (A)
was expressly reaffirming the Parent Recommendation and Parent Determination
and (B) has determined that such Parent Intervening Event (after taking into
account any modifications or adjustments made to this Agreement and the
Transactions and agreed to by the parties hereto) no longer exists); (iii)
during such five (5) Business Day period, Parent and its Representatives have
negotiated in good faith with the Company regarding any revisions to the terms
of this Agreement and the Transactions proposed by the Company in response to
such Parent Intervening Event; and (iv) at the end of the five (5) Business
Day period described in the foregoing _clause (iii)_ , the Parent Board again
concludes in

 



59  good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel (and taking
into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement and
the Transactions proposed by the Company), that a Parent Intervening Event
continues to exist and that the failure to make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the exercise by the Parent
Board of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Parent under
applicable Laws.

(g) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of
the Effective Time and the date of termination of this Agreement, Parent
shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality agreement relating to a Parent Takeover Proposal or standstill
agreement to which Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party (other
than any involving the Company). During such period, Parent agrees to enforce,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any
such agreements, including obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of
such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof
in any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction.

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ shall prohibit the Parent Board
from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of Parent a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of Parent if the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be determined to be inconsistent with applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) any disclosure of a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, an express rejection
of any applicable Parent Takeover Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the
Parent Recommendation, shall be deemed to be a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change and (B) neither Parent nor the Parent Board (nor any committee thereof)
shall make any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with
the other provisions of this _Section 5.03_.

(i)  _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Parent Acquisition Transaction_ " means any transaction or series of
related transactions other than the Merger, the Subsequent Merger or any
transaction permitted pursuant to item 8 of Section 5.01(b) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter involving: (i) any acquisition or purchase by any Third
Party of more than 20% of the total outstanding voting securities of Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries; (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any Third Party beneficially owning more than
20% of the total outstanding voting securities of Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries; (iii) any merger, amalgamation, plan of arrangement,
consolidation, business combination, share exchange, recapitalization or
similar transaction involving Parent or any Parent Subsidiary pursuant to
which the stockholders of Parent immediately preceding such transaction hold
less than 80% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of
such transaction; (iv) any direct or indirect acquisition of any business or
businesses or of assets (including equity interests in any Parent Subsidiary)
that constitute or account for 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues,
net income or assets (based on the fair market value thereof) of Parent and
the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (v) any liquidation or
dissolution of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries.

 



60 " _Parent Takeover Proposal_ " means any offer or proposal by a Third Party
relating to any Parent Acquisition Transaction.

" _Superior Parent Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, bona fide written Parent
Takeover Proposal to acquire more than (i) 50% of the outstanding voting
securities of Parent or (ii) 50% of the consolidated assets of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries, in either case on terms that, in the good faith judgment
of the Parent Board, after consultation with its outside financial advisors
and its outside legal counsel, taking into account relevant legal, financial
and regulatory aspects of the proposal, the identity of the Third Party
making such proposal and the conditions for completion of such proposal (A) is
more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of Parent
than the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, taking
into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
the Company in response to such proposal or otherwise), and (B) is reasonably
capable of being completed on the terms set forth in the proposal, taking
into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects thereof.

_Additional Agreements_

 

SECTION 6.01. _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent
and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC and the
Canadian securities regulatory authorities, the Form S-4, in which the Joint
Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and the
Company shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of the Form S-4 and
Joint Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall provide the other with
the opportunity to review and comment on such documents prior to their filing
with the SEC and the Canadian securities regulatory authorities. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as
necessary to consummate the Merger and the Subsequent Merger. Each of Parent
and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to
the other a "comfort letter" of its independent auditors, dated the date that
is two (2) Business Days prior to the date on which the Form S-4 is expected
to become effective. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4
or the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, without the others prior consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and without providing the
other the opportunity to review and comment thereon (other than Annual Reports
on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or, to the extent the primary
purpose of which is not to disclose information about this Agreement or the
Transactions, Current Reports on Form 8-K or, in each case, the equivalent
Filing under

 



61  applicable Canadian securities Laws). Parent or the Company, as applicable,
will advise the other promptly after it receives oral or written notice of the
time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment
has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written
request by the SEC or the Canadian securities regulatory authorities for
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC or the Canadian securities
regulatory authorities for additional information, and will promptly provide
the other with copies of any written communication from the SEC or the
Canadian securities regulatory authorities or any state securities commission.
If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent
or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors,
is discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement,
so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and applicable Canadian
securities regulatory authorities, after the other party has had a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the respective stockholders of Parent and the
Company. Parent will cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be filed as required
by applicable securities Laws and mailed to Parents stockholders, and the
Company will cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders, in each case as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act.

(b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following effectiveness of the
Form S-4, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
seeking and obtaining the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
the Company by the Company Stockholder Requisite Vote (the " _Company
Stockholder Approval_ ") and the approval of the Merger. Subject to _Sections
5.02(e)_ and _5.02(f)_ , the Company shall, through the Company Board,
recommend that its stockholders adopt and approve this Agreement and the
Merger (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), and shall use reasonable best
efforts to (i) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, and (ii) take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval and the
Company Board shall not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (A) the obligations of
the parties hereunder, including the obligations of the Company in the first
sentence of this _Section 6.01(b)_, shall continue in full force and effect
and (B) the Company shall continue to take all actions necessary to render
inapplicable to this Agreement and the Transactions Section 203 and all other
Takeover Laws.

(c) Parent shall, as soon as practicable following effectiveness of the Form
S-4, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Parent Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
seeking the Parent Stockholder Approval. Subject to _Sections 5.03(e)_ and
_5.03(f)_ , Parent shall, through the Parent Board, recommend that its
stockholders approve the Share Issuance (the " _Parent Recommendation_ "), and
shall use

 



62  reasonable best efforts to (i) solicit from its stockholders proxies in
favor of the Share Issuance and (ii) take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the Parent Stockholder Approval and the Parent Board
shall not effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding any
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, (A) the obligations of the parties hereunder,
including the obligations of Parent in the first sentence of this _Section
6.01(c)_, shall continue in full force and effect and (B) Parent shall
continue to take all actions necessary to render inapplicable to this
Agreement all Takeover Laws.

(d) Each of the Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting,
respectively, on the same date as the other party and as soon as reasonably
practicable after the effectiveness of the Form S-4.

 

SECTION 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to contractual
and legal restrictions applicable to Parent or the Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries with respect to the exchange of information, each of
the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its respective
subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the Representatives of such
other party, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all their
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records
(including the work papers of independent accountants, if available, and
subject to the consent of such independent accountants), including for
purposes of Parent and its Representatives, to conduct audits from time to
time of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries practices and procedures
pursuant to Medicare, Medicaid and any other federal health care program (as
such term is defined in 42 U.S.C. §1320a-7b(f)) activities, and, during such
period, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
respective subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities Laws and (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such access does not unreasonably disrupt
the normal operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, or Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries, as applicable. No investigation pursuant to this
_Section 6.02_ shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement
of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties
hereto. This _Section 6.02_ shall not require the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, to permit any access, or to
disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of such party,
would reasonably be expected to result in (i) the disclosure of any trade
secrets of Third Parties or a violation of any of its obligations with respect
to confidentiality if such party shall have used its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the consent of such Third Party to such inspection or disclosure,
(ii) the loss of attorney-client privilege with respect to such information
(iii) in the case of documents or portions of documents relating to pricing
or other matters that are highly sensitive, a Governmental Entity alleging
that providing such information violates any Regulatory Law or (iv) a
violation of applicable privacy Laws. If any material is withheld by such
party pursuant to the preceding sentence, such party shall inform the other
party as to the general nature of what is being withheld. All information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



63 SECTION 6.03. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notification_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with, applicable Law), to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger, the
Subsequent Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions and Consents from Governmental Entities,
Nasdaq and the TSX and the making of all necessary registrations and Filings
and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or
waiver from, or to avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, Nasdaq or
the TSX, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary Consents from Third Parties, and
(iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Parent, US Corp., Merger Sub, Merger LLC or the Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries be required to (and in no event shall the Company or
any Company Subsidiary without the prior written consent of Parent) pay any
fee, penalty or other consideration to any Third Party or make any other
concession to any Third Party for any Consent required for the consummation of
the Transactions under any Contract.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) to the extent required, (A)
promptly, but in no event later than ten Business Days after the date hereof,
make their respective Filings under the HSR Act and (B) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, make any other required
submissions under the HSR Act (which submissions shall be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act and any other applicable Law),
(ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in (A)
determining whether any Filings are required to be made with, or Consents are
required to be obtained from, any Third Parties or other Governmental Entities
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions and (B) timely making all such Filings
(which Filings shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of
applicable Law) and timely seeking all such Consents and (iii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the Transactions, including taking
all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if
any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of
the United States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement
authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or other
jurisdiction or any other Governmental Entity may assert under Regulatory Law
with respect to the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, in no event shall Parent be required to (and in no event
shall the Company or any Company Subsidiary agree to without the prior written
consent of Parent) divest any assets or agree to divest any assets or consent
to or take any other action or agree to any limitation or make any concession
or other undertaking which would individually, or together with all other such
divestitures, agreements, consents, actions, limitations or concessions, be
reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect (x) the benefits expected
to be derived by Parent as a result of the Merger and the Subsequent Merger,
taken together, (y) the business of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries or of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, in each case as currently conducted,
or (z) the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
contemplated to be conducted on a combined basis with Parent 

 



64  and the Parent Subsidiaries following the Merger and the Subsequent Merger
(any such requirement, individually or together with all other such
requirements, a " _Burdensome Regulatory Action_ "). Subject to applicable
legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company
and Parent shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to
the completion of the Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other communications received by the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective subsidiaries, from any
Third Party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions.
The Company and Parent shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith, the views of the
other party in connection with, any proposed written communication to
any Governmental Entity. Each of the Company and Parent agrees, to the extent
reasonably feasible, not to participate in any meeting or discussion (other
than relating to non-substantive matters such as the scheduling of any
meetings or of any discussions), either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transactions unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate. The Company and Parent shall furnish the other with such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of necessary Filings or
submissions of information to any Governmental Entity. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent or the Company shall have
the right to direct all matters with any Governmental Entity consistent with
its obligations hereunder. Either Parent or the Company may designate any
competitively sensitive information provided to the other under this Agreement
as "outside counsel only". Such materials and the information contained
therein shall be given only to outside legal counsel of the other and will
not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors
of their client unless express written permission is obtained in advance from
the disclosing party or its legal counsel.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 6.03_, if any Proceeding, including any
Proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any Transaction as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any
such Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Judgment that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 6.03_ shall limit a
partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_
or  _8.01(b)(ii)_.

(d) The obligations of Parent, US Corp., Merger Sub and Merger LLC with
respect to obtaining the Financing shall be governed by _Section 6.12_ and
not this _Section 6.03_.

SECTION 6.04.  _Treatment of Company Stock Options, Unvested Company Shares,
Company Stock Purchase Plan and Company Warrants_.

(a) At the Effective Time, if Parent so elects, Parent may assume any or all
of the Company Stock Plans or merge any such Company Stock Plan into any
Parent Stock Plan. If Parent elects to so assume or merge any Company Stock
Plan, then, under such Company Stock Plan, Parent shall be entitled to grant
stock awards, to the extent permissible under applicable

 



65  requirements of Law, using the share reserves of such Company Stock Plan as
of the Effective Time (including any shares returned to such share reserves as
a result of the termination of any option to purchase Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") that is unvested immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is assumed or replaced by Parent pursuant to _Section
6.04(b)_), except that: (i) stock covered by such awards shall be shares of
Parent Common Stock; (ii) all references in such Company Stock Plan to a
number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer
instead to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by
multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the
Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iii) the Parent Board or a
committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to the administration of
such Company Stock Plan.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Company Stock Plans
shall, to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Company Stock
Plan, be assumed by Parent and become and represent an option to purchase the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent Stock Option_
") (decreased to the nearest full share) determined by multiplying (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio (as
hereinafter defined), at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
(rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Option Exchange Ratio. After the Effective
Time, except as provided above in this _Section 6.04(b)_, each Parent Stock
Option shall be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the related Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, after giving effect to any acceleration, lapse or other
vesting occurring by operation of the Merger. The Company shall take all
necessary action to implement and make effective the provisions of this 
_Section 6.04(b)_. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Option Exchange
Ratio_ " means the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio plus (B) a ratio, the
numerator of which is the Per Share Cash Amount and the denominator of which
is the average of the last reported sale price per share of Parent Common
Stock on Nasdaq on each of the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the
Effective Time.

 

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all Unvested Share Restrictions
(as hereinafter defined), including all repurchase and forfeiture rights held
by the Company, shall lapse and the Unvested Company Shares shall become fully
vested shares of Company Common Stock. Such shares of Company Common Stock
shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.01_. For purposes of this
Agreement, (i) " _Unvested Company Share_ " means each outstanding share of
Company Common Stock issued under a Company Stock Plan or otherwise which is
subject to any Unvested Share Restrictions other than shares of Company Common
Stock subject to Company PSU Awards (as defined below), and (ii) " _Unvested
Share Restrictions_ " means all repurchase, cancellation, forfeiture, vesting
and other conditions or restrictions applicable to an Unvested Company Share.
The Company shall take all necessary action to implement and make effective
the provisions of this _Section 6.04(c)_.

 



66 (d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of performance share
units with respect to shares of Company Common Stock granted under a Company
Stock Plan (collectively, the " _Company PSU Awards_ ") which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested at 100% of
the target number of performance share units subject to such Company PSU
Award. Such Company PSU Awards shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.01_.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action
for the adjustment of Company Stock Options, Unvested Company Shares and
Company PSU Awards under this _Section 6.04_. As soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to all such awards.

(f) The Company shall take all action necessary under the Companys
2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company Stock Purchase Plan_ ") to
provide that: (i) no new Offering (as defined in the Company Stock Purchase
Plan) shall commence after the date of this Agreement; (ii) all options
under the Company Stock Purchase Plan outstanding as of the date of this
Agreement shall be exercised, to the extent of any accumulated payroll
deductions as of the exercise date, on the earlier to occur of (A) the end of
the Plan Period (as defined in the Company Stock Purchase Plan) pending as of
the date of this Agreement and (B) a date that is at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) the Company Stock Purchase Plan
shall be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(g) At the Effective Time, each Company 2008 Warrant that is issued, unexpired
and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by
Parent and become and represent a warrant to purchase the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent Warrant_ ") (decreased to the nearest full
share) determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company 2008 Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of
Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock under such Company 2008 Warrant
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Option Exchange Ratio.
After the Effective Time, except as provided above in this _Section
6.04(g)_, each Parent Warrant shall be exercisable upon the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the related Company 2008 Warrant
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall take all necessary
action to implement and make effective the provisions of this _Section
6.04(g)_.

(h) At the Effective Time, each Company 2010 Warrant that is issued,
unexpired and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive, upon payment of the aggregate exercise price of such Company 2010
Warrant, the combination of (x) the product of the Per Share Cash Amount
(without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding
Taxes), multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company 2010 Warrant as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (y) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (decreased to the nearest
full share) equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio, multiplied by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company 2010 Warrant
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall take all
necessary action to implement and make effective the provisions of this
_Section 6.04(h)_.

 



67 SECTION 6.05. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) From the Closing Date until the first anniversary thereof, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to provide each employee of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") with employee benefits
and compensation that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits and compensation that are provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries.

(b) Parent agrees that it will cause the Surviving Company from and after the
Effective Time to honor all Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit
Agreements; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall be
interpreted as limiting the power of Parent or the Surviving Company to amend
or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, any Company Benefit Agreement or any
other individual employee benefit plan, program, Contract or policy or as
requiring Parent or the Surviving Company to offer to continue the employment
of any employee or independent contractor or, other than as required by its
terms, any written employment contract.

(c) With respect to each employee benefit plan in which a Company Employee
becomes a participant, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to (i) fully
credit each participating Company Employee for eligibility and vesting
purposes under such employee benefit plan for such Company Employees service
with the Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date;
provided, that no such service need be given where such credit would result in
a duplication of benefits, (ii) fully credit each participating Company
Employee for any coinsurance, copayments and deductibles paid and for amounts
paid toward any out-of-pocket maximums prior to the date the Company Employee
becomes a participant in such employee benefit plan with respect to
the calendar year in which such participation commences, and (iii) waive all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Company Employees.

 

(d) Parent shall pay or cause the Surviving Company to pay each Company
Employee all annual bonuses earned by such Company Employee with respect to
the 2012 calendar year at the same time and in a manner no less favorable to
the Company Employees than the employee bonuses of similarly situated
employees of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries.

 

(e) Upon the written request of Parent, effective as of the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, the Company and Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to terminate
any and all Company Benefit Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k)
arrangement (collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plans_ "). The form and
substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the review and reasonable
approval of Parent.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as an amendment or other
modification of any Company Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Agreement, Parent
Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Agreement or any other employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement or the establishment of any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement. Nothing herein shall be

 



68  deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any employee of the Surviving
Company or any of its subsidiaries, or to restrict the right of the Surviving
Company, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries to terminate or cause
to be terminated the employment of any employee at any time for any or no
reason with or without notice.

(g) Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this _Section 6.05_ are included for the sole benefit of Parent, US Corp.,
Merger Sub, Merger LLC, the Company, the Surviving Company and their
respective subsidiaries, and that nothing in this _Section 6.05_, whether
express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights
(A) in any other Person, including any employees, former employees, any
participant in any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement (or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof) of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or (B) to
continued employment with Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company, or any
of their respective subsidiaries or continued participation in any employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement.

 

SECTION 6.06. _Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent, US Corp., Merger Sub and Merger LLC each agree that all rights to
exculpation or indemnification arising from, relating to, or otherwise in
respect of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now
existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents
shall survive the Merger and the Subsequent Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of no less than
six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to, and the Surviving Company shall, maintain in effect the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
Companys and any Company Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation and by-
laws or similar organization documents in effect as of the date of this
Agreement or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective
Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company
or any Company Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim
made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Proceeding.

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Company shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds
in respect of each of the foregoing and costs of defense to) each current and
former director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries (each,
together with such individuals heirs, executors or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), in each case against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees and expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual
or threatened Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the fact that
such Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or fiduciary of the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified 

 



69  Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to
the extent required by applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification for such expenses. No Indemnified Party shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual
Proceeding for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party
hereunder unless Parent consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, at or prior to the
Effective Time, prepaid (or "tail") directors and officers insurance and
indemnification policies that provide coverage for events occurring prior to
the Effective Time for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from
the Effective Time that are substantially similar (with respect to limits and
deductibles) to the Companys existing policy. If such "tail" insurance
policy is unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, then Parent shall
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, the Companys
current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time for an
aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time (the "
_Annual D andO Policy_") that is substantially similar (with respect to limits
and deductibles) to the Companys existing policy or, if substantially similar
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Company shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for the Annual DandO Policy in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company s
Current Premium_"). If such premiums for such Annual DandO Policy would at any
time exceed 300% of the Companys Current Premium, then Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be maintained policies of insurance which,
in Parents good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available
at an annual premium equal to 300% of the Companys Current Premium. The
Company represents to Parent that the Companys Current Premium is $595,404.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets, then,
and in each case, Parent and the Surviving Company shall ensure that such
surviving entity or the transferees of such properties or assets assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.06_.

SECTION 6.07. _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as provided below, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other Transactions, including
the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants,
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
the Merger and the Subsequent Merger is consummated; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all HSR Act filing fees and all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the printing, filing and mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement and the
Form S-4 (including the applicable SEC filing fees) shall be divided equally
between Parent and the Company.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if (i) this
Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section
8.01(b)(i)_ or _Section_

 



70   _8.01(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_ as a result of
the Companys breach or failure to perform one or more of its covenants in
this Agreement and (ii)(A) a Company Takeover Proposal existed between the
date hereof and the date of the termination of this Agreement and (B) such
Company Takeover Proposal was not withdrawn prior to, in the case of a

of or failure to perform this Agreement giving rise to the right to terminate

demand by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified
in writing by Parent for all Transaction Expenses of Parent and its Affiliates
within two Business Days after receipt of notice by Parent of all such
Transaction Expenses.

8.01(c)_ as a result of the Companys breach or failure to perform one or

Transaction, in each case, with the Third Party or any of its Affiliates that

immediately available funds to an account specified in writing by Parent, less
the aggregate amount of any Transaction Expenses previously paid or
reimbursed to Parent and its Affiliates pursuant to _Section 6.07(b)_, such

71 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if (i) this
Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section
8.01(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.01(b)(iv)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section

the Company and its Affiliates within two Business Days after receipt of
notice by the Company of all such Transaction Expenses.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if (i)(A)
this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section
8.01(b)(i)_ or _8.01(b)(iv)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_
as a result of Parents breach or failure to perform one or more of its
covenants in this Agreement, (B)(1) a Parent Takeover Proposal existed between
the date hereof and the date of the termination of this Agreement and (2) such
Parent Takeover Proposal was not withdrawn prior to, in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_, the Outside Date, in the case
of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(iv)_, at least five (5)

72 (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if all of the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Sections 7.01_ and _7.02_ are satisfied
or waived (or, upon an immediate Closing, would be satisfied as of such
Closing) and (i) Parent, US Corp., Merger Sub or Merger LLC cannot satisfy its
obligation to effect the Closing at such time as contemplated in _Section
1.02_ or such later time as agreed to by the Company because of a Financing
Failure and (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_
then Parent shall pay to the Company a fee equal to $281,500,000 (the "
_Parent Financing Failure Fee_ ") no later than two (2) Business Days after
such termination by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
specified in writing by the Company.

(g) In the event of a Financing Failure, Parents payment of the Parent
Financing Failure Fee will be considered liquidated damages for any breach by
Parent of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in the event of a Financing Failure, the Companys right to receive
payment of the Parent Financing Failure Fee pursuant to _Section 6.07(f)_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and all rights or claims, whether at Law or in equity, in
contract, tort or otherwise, of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any
stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
representatives or agents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and any
Affiliate of any of the foregoing are hereby deemed waived, against Parent,
US Corp., Merger Sub and Merger LLC and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives (and any of their respective Affiliates and any of such
entities or their Affiliates respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, shareholders, managers, members, directors, officers,
employees, representatives or agents in connection with this Agreement, the
Financing or the Financing Letter) for any and all losses, damages and
expenses suffered or incurred by the Company or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or the Financing and upon
payment of such amount, none of Parent, US Corp., Merger Sub, Merger LLC or
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions or the Financings, in each case whether at Law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any
legal or equitable Proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable Laws or otherwise and whether by or through a claim by or on behalf
of a party hereto or any Third Party (including a claim to enforce the
Financing Letter) or otherwise, other than in the case of _Sections 6.07(a)_
, _6.07(h)_ and any obligations of Parent pursuant to the last sentence of
_Section 6.02_.

(h) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 6.07_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that,
without these agreements neither Parent nor the Company would have entered
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the
amounts due pursuant to _Sections 6.07(b)_ or _6.07(c)_ or Parent fails to
promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to _Sections 6.07(d)_ , _6.07(e)_ or
_6.07(f)_ , and, in order to obtain such payment Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, commences a suit which results in a Judgment against the Company
or Parent, as applicable, for any of the amounts set forth in _Sections
6.07(b)_ , _6.07(c)_ , _6.07(d)_ , _6.07(e)_ or _6.07(f)_ then the Company
shall pay to Parent or Parent shall pay to the Company, as the case may be,
its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to _Sections 6.07(b)_
, _6.07(c)_ , _6.07(d)_ , _6.07(e)_ or _6.07(f)_ at the prime rate of JPMorgan

such party.

Acquisition Transaction" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in _Section

Takeover Proposal" for purposes of this _Section 6.07_), and (y) "Parent
Acquisition Transaction" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in _Section
5.03(i)_, except that references in such definition to "20%" and "80%" shall
be replaced by "50%" (including with respect to the definition of "Parent
Takeover Proposal" for purposes of this _Section 6.07_).

 

SECTION 6.08. _Public Announcements_. Parent, US Corp., Merger Sub and Merger
LLC, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with
each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other Transactions and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except to the extent required by Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

Corporation, and the Company shall cooperate with Merger Sub and Parent in
preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer

(a) The Company agrees to make such reasonable representations as requested by
counsel for the purpose of rendering the opinion described in _Section
1.08(c)_.

 

(b) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary shall take any action or fail to take any action
which action or failure, to the Knowledge of the Company, would disqualify the
Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, if they would otherwise so
qualify.

(c) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, neither Parent nor
any Parent Subsidiary shall take any action or fail to take any action which
action or failure, to the Knowledge of Parent, would disqualify the Merger and
the Subsequent Merger, taken together, as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, if they would otherwise so qualify.

 



74 (d) Provided that the opinions described in _Section 1.08(c)_ are received on
or prior to the Closing Date, each of Parent, US Corp., Merger Sub, Merger
LLC and the Company hereby adopt this Agreement as a plan of reorganization
within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the U.S. Treasury
Regulations. 

SECTION 6.12. _Financing_.

(a) Parents, US Corp.s and Merger Subs obligations hereunder are not
subject to any conditions regarding Parents, US Corp.s, Merger Subs or any
other persons ability to finance, or obtain financing for, the Transactions.

(b) From and after the execution of this Agreement, Parent, US Corp. and
Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Letter and
shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, any replacement
of all or any portion of any facilities (or commitments thereof) described
in, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Financing Letter, if
such amendment, modification, replacement or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid
or original issue discount except by operation of the "flex" provisions in the
related fee letter) unless such reduction is replaced with Replacement
Financing or cash on hand or (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of
any portion of the Financing in a manner that would or would reasonably be
expected to (A) delay or prevent the Closing or the Closing Date, (B) make
the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Financing) less likely to occur or (C) adversely impact the ability of
Parent, US Corp. or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce their rights
against other parties to the Financing Letter or the definitive agreements to
be entered into with respect to the Financing, including any right to seek
specific performance of the Financing Letter or such definitive
agreements. Subject to the limitations set out in the first sentence of this
_Section 6.12(b)_, Parent, US Corp. and Merger Sub may (1) amend, supplement,
modify, replace or substitute the Financing Letter as in effect at the date
hereof, including to (x) add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Financing
Letter as of the date of this Agreement, (y) increase the amount of
Indebtedness and (z) replace all or a portion of the facility committed under
the Financing Letter as in effect as of the date hereof with one or more new
facilities under such Financing Letter or under any new commitment letter or
facility or (2) replace all or a portion of the Financing with substitute or
replacement debt financing or equity financing (consistent with the equity
financing described in Section 4.02(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter) (any
such new commitment or facility described in _clause (z)_ above or Financing
described in _clause (2)_ above, a " _Replacement Financing_ "), provided
that any amendments, modifications or replacements of any Replacement
Financing shall be subject to the same limitations that apply to the
Financing Letter as set forth in the first sentence of this _Section
6.12(b)_. From and after the execution of this Agreement, Parent, US Corp. and
Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain a
corporate credit rating from each of Standard and Poors Ratings Services and
Moodys Investors Services, Inc.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent, US
Corp. and Merger Sub will use its reasonable best efforts to maintain in
effect the Financing 

 



75  Letter pursuant to its terms until the Merger is consummated and to obtain
the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Letter,
including using its reasonable best efforts (i) to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contained in the Financing Letter (including any applicable "flex" provisions
contained in the related fee letter), (ii) to satisfy all conditions on a
timely basis to obtaining the Financing applicable to each of Parent, US Corp.
and Merger Sub set forth in such definitive agreements that are within its
control, (iii) to comply in all respects with its covenants and obligations
under the Financing Letter and (iv) subject to _Section 6.07_, to enforce
through exercise of all available remedies its rights under the Financing
Letter in the event of a breach or other failure to fund by the Lenders.
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of any of the
following: (A) any material breach or default of the Financing Letter by a
party to the Financing Letter or definitive document with respect to the
Financing of which they become aware; (B) the receipt of any written notice
or other written communication from any Financing Source with respect to any
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing
Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing of any provisions
of the Financing Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing
and (C) if for any reason Parent, US Corp. or Merger Sub believes in good
faith that they will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing required to consummate the Transactions. Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonable basis and in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to the Company, upon its
written request, copies of the definitive material documents related to the
Financing (other than fee letters and any other documentation subject to
confidentiality restrictions). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this  _Section 6.12(c)_ shall require Parent to disclose any information
that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent shall have
used its reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that
would not waive such privilege. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in the event that all conditions in the Financing Letter have been
satisfied or, upon funding, will be satisfied, Parent, US Corp. and Merger Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders to fund on the
Closing Date the Financing required to consummate the Merger, the Subsequent
Merger and the other Transactions. In the event that Parent, US Corp. or
Merger Sub becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes procurement
of any portion of the Financing unlikely to occur in the manner or from the
sources contemplated in the Financing Letter, Parent, US Corp. or Merger Sub
shall, in addition to promptly notifying the Company in writing of such event
or circumstance, use their respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly
as practicable, arrange any such portion (other than amounts that are replaced
by Parents cash on hand and marketable securities) from alternative
sources (such portion from alternate sources, the " _Alternate Financing_ ")
in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided, however_ , that Parent, US Corp. and Merger Sub shall not be
required to agree to terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions)
that are, in the aggregate, materially less favorable to Parent, US Corp. and
Merger Sub than those contained in the Financing Letter (and the "flex"
provisions contained in the related fee letter). For the avoidance of doubt,
the syndication of any part of the Financing in accordance with the terms of
the Financing Letter shall not be deemed to violate Parents obligations under
this Agreement. 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their Representatives, officers and employees to provide, on a
timely basis, all reasonable cooperation

 



76  requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Financing to
the extent that such cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including (i)
using reasonable best efforts to facilitate the provision of guarantees and
pledge of collateral (effective as of the actual occurrence of Closing), (ii)
providing customary financial and other pertinent information regarding the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and cooperating in the preparation of pro
forma financial information for the Transactions (including information to be
used in the preparation of an information package, offering memorandum,
prospectus, prospectus supplement or similar document regarding the business,
assets, operations, financial projections and prospects of Parent and the
Company customary for such financing or reasonably necessary for the
completion of the Financing), including the financial information required to
be delivered pursuant to the Financing Letter and such other information as
may be reasonably requested in writing by Parent to assist in preparation of
customary offering or information documents to be used for the completion of
the Financing, (iii) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts for the
Financing (it being acknowledged that the Company hereby consents to the
reasonable use of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries logos provided
that such logos are used in a manner that is not reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or their marks and on such other customary terms and
conditions as the Company shall reasonably impose) and using commercially
reasonable efforts to provide an introduction and access to the Companys
existing lenders in connection with any syndication efforts, (iv) providing
copies of any recent appraisals, environmental reports, evidence of title
(including copies of deeds, lease documentation, title insurance policies
and/or commitments for title insurance, title opinions, surveys, and similar
information), and similar information with respect to the properties and
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are in the Companys
possession and that are reasonably requested by Parent, (v) providing other
