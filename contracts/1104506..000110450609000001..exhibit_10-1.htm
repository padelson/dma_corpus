set aside a cash reserve which is sufficient to pay all of the Retained
Liabilities. The amount of this reserve shall be as reasonably determined by
the Seller's Board of Directors and shall include an amount that is
sufficient to pay all current Liabilities of the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries and all reasonably anticipated future Liabilities of the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, including all Liabilities (i) under

"Code"), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the

the consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a breach or default
thereof, cause or permit the acceleration or termination thereof or in any
way materially and adversely affect the rights of the Seller,
its Subsidiaries or Purchaser thereunder or the rights of Purchaser to the
Key Products or other Purchased Assets. In the event that any
Purchased Contract cannot be so assigned or a third party to any such
Purchased Contract shall not consent to such assignment, the Seller shall
provide to Purchaser all of the Seller's rights and interests in and to such
Purchased Contracts and, where necessary or appropriate, the Seller shall be
deemed to be Purchaser's duly appointed agent for the purpose of completing,
fulfilling and discharging all of Purchaser's rights and liabilities arising
after the Second Closing Date with respect to such Purchased Contracts. The
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser
with the benefit of such Purchased Contracts including (i) enforcing any
rights under such Purchased Contracts (including the right to terminate in
accordance with the terms thereof upon the request of Purchaser) or (ii)
permitting Purchaser to enforce any rights as if such Purchased Contracts had
been sold, conveyed, assigned and transferred to Purchaser.

the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(b) The Seller has made available to Purchaser true, correct and complete

part of the Seller and no other corporate action on the part of the Seller is
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by the Seller
of this Agreement or the consummation by it of the Transactions.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Seller
and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
hereto, constitutes legal, valid and binding obligations of the Seller,
enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity (the "Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception").

 

 

(b) The Seller's Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held at

and the Transactions are advisable and in the best interests of the Seller
and its shareholders and (iii) electing, to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws, to make inapplicable all state takeover laws or similar Laws
of the VSCA, to the extent they might otherwise apply to the execution,
delivery, performance or consummation of this Agreement or the Transactions,
and none of the aforesaid actions by the Seller's Board of Directors has been
amended, rescinded or modified as of the date hereof. No further corporate
action is required by the Seller's Board of Directors in order for the Seller
to approve this Agreement or the Transactions.

 

 

(c) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller, the
consummation by the Seller of the Transactions or compliance by the Seller
with any of the terms or provisions hereof will (i) conflict with, or result

corporate standing (or equivalent status) as a foreign corporation or other
entity in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business or activities
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned, leased or operated by it requires such license or qualification,
except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing (or
equivalent status) has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of (i) Parent or Purchaser to perform
its obligations, or (ii) for Purchaser to consummate the Transactions, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (each a "Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect").

 

 

Section 3.2 Authority; Noncontravention.

 

 

(a) Each of Parent and Purchaser has all requisite corporate or other power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, and to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The execution,

authorized by all necessary corporate or other action on the part of Parent

it of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by Parent and Purchaser and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by the Seller, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable against each of them in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

of the organizational documents of Purchaser or the articles of incorporation
or bylaws of Parent, (ii) assuming that the authorizations, consents and
approvals referred to in Section 3.3 and the filings referred to in Section
3.3 are timely made, violate any Law applicable to Parent and Purchaser or
its properties or assets or (iii) assuming that the authorizations, consents
and approvals referred to in Section 2.4 and the filings referred to in
Section 2.4 are timely made, conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a
default (or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
of any obligations or loss of any material benefit) under, require a consent
or waiver under, require the payment of a penalty under, any terms,
conditions or provisions of any loan or credit agreement, debenture, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust or Contract to which Parent

not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or
Purchaser or the consummation by Parent or Purchaser of the Transactions,
other than such other consents, approvals, filings, declarations or
registrations that, if not obtained, made or given, would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect.

solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, has engaged in no
other business activities and has conducted its operations only as

and when needed, the funds that are necessary to consummate the Transactions
and to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

Section 3.6 Legal Proceedings. There is no legal or administrative
proceeding, claim, suit or action pending or, threatened, against or
affecting, or that may have the effect of preventing, delaying, making
illegal or otherwise interfering with, the ability of Parent or Purchaser to
consummate the Transactions, before (or, in the case of threatened actions,
suits, investigations or proceedings, would be before) any arbitrator or
Governmental Authority, except as have not had and would not reasonably be

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Second
Closing, the Seller and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to
facilitate and shall cooperate with Purchaser and its representatives
regarding, the Work Plan. In addition, the Seller will promptly provide
Parent and Purchaser with electronic copies of all INS-19 Granulocyte Colony
Stimulating Factor and INS-20 Pegylated Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor
study datasets (including any that the Seller receives before the Second
Closing), along with (i) the results of any analyses performed on such
datasets by or on behalf of the Seller and (ii) all statistical programs used
by the Seller to analyze the same. In furtherance of the Seller's obligations
in Section 4.6(b) and subject to the provisions of Section 4.6(b), the Seller
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (x) maintain the secrecy of all
information or materials disclosed by Parent or Purchaser to the Seller or
its Subsidiaries in connection with the Work Plan and (y) not disclose such
information or materials to any third party or use such information or
materials for any other purpose except as provided in the Work Plan without
the prior written consent of Parent.

 

 

Section 4.2 No Solicitation.

 

 

(a) General Prohibitions. Subject to Section 4.2(b), the Seller shall not,
nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their respective directors, officers or employees, or any investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other advisors, agents or
representatives retained by the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, furnish to any third party
any information (whether orally or in writing) in connection with, or in
furtherance, of any Acquisition Proposal, or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with, or knowingly
assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, any third
party that has made, is seeking to make or has informed the Seller of any
intention to make, or has publicly announced an intention to make, an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) take any action not already taken to make the
provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute
or regulation (including approving any transaction under, or a third party
becoming an "interested shareholder" under, Article 14 (Affiliated
Transactions) of the VSCA), or any restrictive provision of any applicable
anti-takeover provision in the Seller's articles of incorporation or bylaws,
inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal,
(iv) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, asset purchase agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
instrument constituting or relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement of the type referred to in Section 4.2(b)) or (v)
grant any third party any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions on the Seller set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries shall
be a breach of this Section by the Seller.

 

 

(b) Exceptions after Receipt of Certain Proposals. Notwithstanding anything
that may be to the contrary herein, at any time prior to the Second Closing,
the Board of Directors of the Seller, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, may, subject to compliance with Section 4.2(c), (i)
if there has been no breach or failure to comply with Section 4.2(a), engage
in negotiations or discussions with any third party that has made after the
date of this Agreement a Superior Proposal or a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Seller determines in good faith
(after considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel) is reasonably likely to lead to the
receipt of a Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter, furnish to such third party
information relating to the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the Seller than
those contained in the Bilateral Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
August 11, 2008, between Parent and the Seller (as it may be amended from
time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement") (a copy of which shall,
subject to Section 4.2(c), be provided, promptly after its execution, for
informational purposes only to Purchaser, and which copy and the terms and
existence thereof shall be subject to the confidentiality obligations imposed
on Parent pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement), provided, that, subject
to Section 4.2(c), all such information (to the extent that such information
has not been previously provided or made or had been previously made
available to Purchaser) is provided or made or had been previously made
available to Purchaser, as the case may be, prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such third
party), and provided, further, that if such Superior Proposal or Acquisition
Proposal is made by a third party who or which, on the date hereof, is party
to a confidentiality agreement with the Seller which would prohibit the
Seller from complying with any of the terms of this Section 4.2(b) or
Section 4.2(c) requiring the provision by the Seller of information,
agreements or the documents to Purchaser, then the Seller may take the
actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 4.2(b) only if
such confidentiality agreement with such third party has been amended (and
the Seller shall be permitted to amend such confidentiality agreement) to
allow the Seller to fully comply with such terms of this Section 4.2(b) and
Section 4.2(c) without violating such confidentiality agreement and (iii)
following receipt of a Superior Proposal after the date of this Agreement and
subject to compliance with Section 4.2(d), enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal if, and only if, concurrently therewith
the Seller (x) terminates this Agreement and (y) pays to Parent the Seller
Termination Fee, but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i)
through (iii) only if the Board of Directors of the Seller determines in good
faith by a majority vote, after considering advice from outside legal counsel
to the Seller, that its failure to take such action would result in a breach
of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

 

(c) Required Notices. The Seller shall not take any of the actions
referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 4.2(b) unless the Seller
shall have delivered to Purchaser a prior written notice advising Purchaser
that it intends to take such action, and the Seller shall continue to advise
Purchaser after taking such action of the status and terms of any discussions
and negotiations with the third party. In addition, the Seller shall notify
Purchaser promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the
Seller (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal or of any
request for information relating to the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or
for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries by any third party that may be considering
making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided
orally and in writing and shall identify the third party making, and the
terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request
(including any changes thereto). The Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably
informed, on a current basis, of the status and details of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including any material changes
thereto) and shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours
after receipt) provide to Purchaser copies of all correspondence and written
materials sent or provided to the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries that
describe the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

(d) Limitations on the Seller's Ability to Terminate this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the last sentence of Section 4.2(b), the Board of
Directors of the Seller shall not take an action described in clause (iii) of
Section 4.2(b) unless (i) the Seller promptly notifies Purchaser, in writing,
at least five Business Days before taking that action, of its intention to do
so in response to an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior
Proposal, attaching the most current version of any proposed agreement or a
detailed summary of the material terms of any such proposal and the identity
of the offeror and (ii) Purchaser does not make, within such five-Business-
Day period, an offer that is at least as favorable to the Seller, as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Seller in good faith
(after considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation), as such Superior Proposal (it being understood that
the Seller shall not take any action described in clause (iii) of Section
4.2(b) during such five-Business-Day period, and that any material amendment
to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new written notification from the Seller and an additional
five-Business-Day period).

 

 

(e) Definitions of Acquisition Proposal and Superior Proposal. For purposes
of this Agreement:

 

 

"Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any third
party relating to any (i) acquisition of any of the Purchased Assets, (ii)
acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock or any
other voting securities of the Seller, (iii) tender offer (including a self-
tender offer) or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any third
party beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding shares of capital
stock or any other voting securities of the Seller or (iv) merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of the Seller, in each
case other than the Transactions.

 

 

"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written proposal (on its most
recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third
party to enter into an Acquisition Proposal (with all of the percentages
included in the definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to 100% and the
reference to "any of the Purchased Assets" in clause (i) of the definition of
the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed a reference to 100% of the
assets of the Seller other than the First Closing Assets), and which is
otherwise on terms and conditions which the Board of Directors of the Seller
determines by a majority vote, in its good faith (after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel) and in light of all relevant circumstances and all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement, including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, to be more
favorable to the Seller's shareholders than the Transactions and for which
financing, if a cash transaction (in whole or in part), is then committed and
which is not subject to any financing conditions.

 

 

(f) Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Seller shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing soliciting
activities, discussions or negotiations and non-public information access, if
any, with or to any third party conducted prior to the date hereof with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Seller shall promptly request that
each third party, if any, in possession of Confidential Information about the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with its consideration of any
potential Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all Confidential
Information heretofore furnished to such third party.

 

 

(g) Certain Limited Exceptions. Nothing in this Section 4.2 shall prohibit
the Board of Directors of the Seller from taking and disclosing to the
Seller's shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other
applicable Law, if such Board determines, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to so disclose such position could constitute a
violation of applicable Law.

 

 

Section 4.3 Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to
be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions
set forth in ARTICLE V to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Governmental Authority necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions; provided that in no event shall Parent or Purchaser be required
by this Section 4.3(a) or any other provision of this Agreement to (A)
license, divest, dispose of or hold separate any material portion of the
Purchased Assets or the assets or businesses of Parent, Purchaser or any
other Subsidiary of Purchaser or otherwise take or commit to take any action
that limits in any respect its freedom of action with respect to, or
its ability to retain, any material portion of the Purchased Assets or the
assets or businesses of Parent, Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of
Purchaser, or that would have an adverse effect on Parent, Purchaser or any
other Subsidiary of Purchaser after giving effect to the Transactions, (B)
agree to or effect any license, divestiture, disposition or hold separate any
business, (C) initiate any action or proceeding against any Governmental
Authority or third party or defend any action that shall have been initiated
by any Governmental Authority or third party (including any shareholders of
the Seller, whether brought directly, derivatively or otherwise) or (D) pay
any material amounts in connection with seeking or obtaining such consents,
approvals or authorizations as are required to complete the Transactions.

 

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
parties hereto shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all
action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is
or becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and (ii) if any state
takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the
Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement, and use their reasonable best efforts to otherwise minimize the
effect of such Law on the Transactions.

 

 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority
relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding initiated by a private
party and (ii) keep the other party informed in all material respects and on
a reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by such
party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental
Authority and of any material communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of
the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange
of information, each of the parties hereto shall have the right to review
in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all
the information relating to the other parties and their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions; provided, however, that
the parties may designate certain of such filings, or certain information
contained therein, as being provided on an outside counsel basis only. No
party hereto shall independently participate in any meeting or discussion
with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings,
applications, investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other
parties hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by
the relevant Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and
participate (which, at the request of any of the parties, shall be limited to
outside antitrust counsel only).

 

 

(d) The Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause its
Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts, to (i) facilitate the transfer to
Purchaser at Closing of all: (A) regulatory files and permits related to
the Boulder Facilities (including all environmental permits/waste water
discharge permits) and (B) the Purchased Assets Regulatory Documentation (and
Purchaser's ability to reference all Purchased Assets Regulatory
Documentation) and (ii) file or transmit, as applicable, such notices,
letters, instruments and the like with or to the FDA and any other applicable
Regulatory Authority to the Transactions as may required to comply with all
applicable Laws, and to effectuate such transfers and vest all right, title,
and interest in (x) the First Closing Assets in Purchaser promptly following
the First Closing and (y) the Second Closing Assets effective as of the
Second Closing.

 

 

(e) The Seller shall cooperate with Parent or Purchaser in obtaining the
written consent of the licensor identified in Section 2.16(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules to an assignment of the license agreement set forth in
Section 2.16(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules to Parent or Purchaser in
connection with the manufacture, practice, use, offer for sale, import and
sale of the Key Products, such assignment to be effective as of the Second
Closing or as promptly as practicable thereafter, and on substantially
similar terms as the license agreement set forth in Section 2.16(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules.

 

 

Section 4.4 Certain Filings and Notices; SEC Filings.

 

 

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with one another (a) in determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are
required to be obtained from parties to any material Contracts, in connection
with the consummation of the Transactions and (b) in taking such actions or
making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection
therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals
or waivers.

 

 

(b) Before the Seller shall make any filing required by the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, the
Seller shall consult in good faith with Parent before making any such filing
by providing the Parent with a copy of the proposed filing reasonably in
advance of such filing and making any changes, additions or redactions
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions which may be reasonably
requested by Parent.

 

 

Section 4.5 Public Announcements. Purchaser and the Seller have agreed upon
the form and substance of each of the press releases to be issued by
Purchaser and the Seller, respectively, announcing the execution of this
Agreement and the Transactions, which shall be issued promptly following the
execution and delivery hereof. Until the earlier of the Second Closing or
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VI, neither the Seller
nor Parent (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other
press release or make any other public announcement with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions without the prior consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a national
securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public announcement shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before
making any such public announcements by providing the other party with a copy
of the proposed press release or public announcement reasonably in advance of
such release or announcement and making any changes reasonably requested by
the other party.

 

 

Section 4.6 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

 

 

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the
Seller shall afford to Parent's and Purchaser's Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Second
Closing or the termination of this Agreement to all of its and its
Subsidiaries' properties, books, Contracts, personnel and records and the
Seller shall (i) furnish promptly to Parent and Purchaser (1) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and (2)
other information concerning its and its Subsidiaries' business, properties
and personnel as Parent, Purchaser or any of their Representatives may
reasonably request and (ii) instruct its employees, counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized Representatives to cooperate with
Parent and Purchaser in their investigation of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries. The information provided will be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Neither the Seller nor its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would materially interfere with the conduct of its business,
contravene any Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, or would
reasonably be expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment of any
attorney-client or work product privilege. The parties hereto will use
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangement under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. No investigation pursuant to this Section 4.6 or information
provided, made available or delivered to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement
(other than information contained in the Seller Disclosure Schedule) will
affect any of the representations or warranties of the Seller contained in
this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the obligations of the parties
hereto.

 

 

(b) The Seller recognizes that by reason of its ownership of the Purchased
Assets, including its use and ownership of the Key Products, the Seller and
its Affiliates have acquired Confidential Information and Trade Secrets
concerning the Key Products and the other Purchased Assets, the use or
disclosure of which could cause Parent, Purchaser or their Affiliates
substantial loss and damages. Accordingly, the Seller covenants to Parent and
Purchaser that the Seller and its Affiliates will not, except in performance
of its obligations to Parent and Purchaser or with the prior written consent
of Parent, directly or indirectly, disclose Confidential Information relating
to the Key Products or other Purchased Assets that it may learn or has
learned by reason of its ownership of the Key Products or other Purchased
Assets, unless (i) it is or becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of disclosure by the Seller or any of its Affiliates, (ii)
it is generally made available to third parties without any limitations on
its use or disclosure or (iii) disclosure is required by applicable Law.
Nothing in this Section 4.6(b) shall be deemed to permit the disclosure by
the Seller or any of its Affiliates of any Trade Secrets concerning the Key
Products or the other Purchased Assets.

 

 

(c) The Seller shall preserve until the sixth anniversary of the First
Closing Date all properties, books, Contracts and records possessed by the
Seller and its Subsidiaries which are not included in the First Closing
Assets which may contain information relating to any of the First Closing
Assets. From and after the First Closing, the Seller shall provide Parent,
Purchaser and their Representatives with reasonable access during normal
business hours to such properties, books, Contracts and records as well
as personnel. Parent and Purchaser and their Representatives shall have the
right to make copies of such books, Contracts and records. If the Seller
intends to liquidate or dissolve during such six-year period, the
Seller shall first offer in writing at least ninety (90) days prior to such
liquidation or dissolution to transfer such properties, books, Contracts and
records to Parent.

 

 

(d) The Seller shall preserve until the sixth anniversary of the Second
Closing Date all properties, books, Contracts and records possessed by the
Seller and its Subsidiaries which are not included in the Second Closing
Assets which may contain information relating to any of the Second Closing
Assets, Assumed Liabilities or Key Products Employees. From and after the
Second Closing, the Seller shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their
Representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to such
properties, books, Contracts and records as well as personnel. Parent and
Purchaser and their Representatives shall have the right to make copies of
such books, Contracts and records. If the Seller intends to liquidate or
dissolve during such six-year period, the Seller shall first offer in writing
at least ninety (90) days prior to such liquidation or dissolution to
transfer such properties, books, Contracts and records to Parent.

 

 

(e) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, and
with respect to the Purchased Assets and the Boulder Facilities, until the
second anniversary of the Second Closing Date, Parent and Purchaser shall
afford to the Seller and its Representatives reasonable access to records
contained in the Purchased Assets and the Key Products Employees during
normal business hours after the Second Closing Date and on at least three
Business Days' prior written notice, for any reasonable business purpose
specified by the Seller in such notice.

 

 

Section 4.7 Notification of Certain Matters.

 

 

(a) The Seller shall give prompt notice to Parent and Purchaser, and Parent
and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the Seller, of (i) any written
notice or other written communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions and (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations
or proceedings commenced or, to such party's Knowledge, threatened against,
such party or any of its Subsidiaries and relating to the Transactions.
In addition, prior to the Second Closing, the Seller shall give prompt notice
to Parent and Purchaser of any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
of the Seller contained in this Agreement, or any failure of the Seller to
materially comply with any covenant or agreement of the Seller set forth
herein, at any time during the term of this Agreement that would reasonably
be expected to give rise to a termination right pursuant to
Section 6.1(c)(i); provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 4.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving that notice.

 

 

(b) Without limiting any other provision hereof, the Seller shall promptly
provide Parent and Purchaser with a copy of all written communication
received by the Seller from, or given by the Seller to, the FDA and any other
Regulatory Authority, with respect to the Purchased Assets and the Boulder
Facilities. The Seller shall give prompt notice to Parent and Purchaser of
any formal or informal meetings that may take place between the date of this
Agreement and the Second Closing with the FDA and any other Regulatory
Authority with respect to the Purchased Assets or the Boulder Facilities.
Parent and Purchaser shall have the right to attend and participate in all
such meetings with the FDA and other Regulatory Authority. If such attendance
is prohibited by applicable Law, Parent and Purchaser shall have the right to
send an independent third party consultant to attend such meetings in its
place.

 

 

Section 4.8 Fees and Expenses. Except as provided in Section 6.3, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid
by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Transactions
are consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the Transactions by the Seller shall be borne by
the Seller and none shall be borne by, or be the responsibility of, Parent
or Purchaser or included in the Assumed Liabilities.

 

 

Section 4.9 Transferred Employees.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Second Closing Date, but effective as of, and conditioned
upon, the Second Closing, Parent or Purchaser shall offer employment on an
at-will basis to the Key Products Employees set forth in Section 2.10(a)(i)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, which will be effective immediately
following the Second Closing (each such employee, upon accepting an offer of
employment from Parent or Purchaser, a "Transferred Employee"); provided,
that, Parent and Purchaser shall not be obligated to make offers of
employment to those Key Products Employees who are not actively at work on
the Second Closing Date other than due to vacation. In Parent's sole
discretion, Parent or Purchaser may elect to make offers of employment to
those Key Products Employees who are not actively at work on the Second
Closing Date due to sick leave, leave covered by the Family and Medical Leave
Act, or other similar short-term absence. Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall
be obligated to offer employment to the Key Products Employees set forth in
Section 2.10(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 

 

(b) For the period commencing on the Second Closing and ending on December
31, 2009, Parent or Purchaser shall maintain the base salary for the
Transferred Employees at the same levels that are in effect on the date
hereof, except that Parent or Purchaser may reduce such base salary levels
consistent with a company-wide base salary reduction implemented by Parent.

 

 

(c) Effective as of the Second Closing, the Transferred Employees shall
participate in Parent's annual bonus incentive program on the same terms and
conditions, including bonus target levels as similarly situated newly hired
employees of Parent, provided that if Seller does not pay Transferred
Employees any annual bonus at or prior to Closing for 2009, then Parent shall
count service to Seller (including any Subsidiary thereof) as if such service
was provided to Parent (or any Subsidiary of Parent) for purposes of
determining annual bonus incentive compensation for 2009 under Parent's
annual bonus incentive program.

 

 

(d) Effective as of the Second Closing, the Transferred Employees shall
participate in the employee benefit plans and programs of Parent (the "Parent
Plans") on the same terms and conditions as those that apply to similarly
situated newly hired employees of Parent, except (i) subject to
Section 4.9(e), for purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate,
Parent or Purchaser shall treat, and cause the applicable Parent Plan to
treat, the service of the Transferred Employees with the Seller (including
any predecessor or Subsidiary thereof) attributable to any period before the
Second Closing as service rendered to Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent;
provided, that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual
or eligibility for subsidized early retirement benefits under any defined
benefit pension plan, for purposes of eligibility for retiree medical, dental
or life benefits or calculating retiree healthcare premiums or to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect
to the same period of service, (ii) Parent shall waive any pre-existing
condition limitations and eligibility waiting periods for the Transferred
Employees and their eligible dependents under Parent Plans that are self-
insured by Parent and that provide medical and dental benefits and (iii)
under Parent Plans that are self-insured by Parent and that provide medical
and dental benefits, Parent shall give credit to Transferred Employees and
their eligible dependents for payments made during 2009 for co-payments and
deductibles under Seller Plans that provide medical and dental benefit.

 

 

(e) Effective as of the Second Closing, the Transferred Employees shall be
entitled to participate in Parent's severance benefits plan applicable to its
U.S. based non-union employees (the "Parent Severance Plan") on the same
terms and conditions as apply to similarly situated employees of Parent and
Parent shall treat the service of the Transferred Employees with the Seller
(including any predecessor or Subsidiary thereof) before the Second Closing
as service rendered to Parent for purposes of calculating severance pay and
benefits under the Parent Severance Plan; provided, that such service will
not apply for purposes of qualifying for treatment as a retiree or a bridged
retiree (as that term is defined in the Parent Severance Plan) under the
Parent Severance Plan.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.9 to the contrary, the Seller
shall be solely responsible for (i) any and all Liabilities,
including, without limitation, any severance and/or change in control
arrangements, under the Seller Plans for all periods ending before, on or
after the Closing Date for all of Seller's employees (including former
employees, retirees and independent contractors), including the Transferred
Employees, (ii) for any and all Liabilities for compensation and employee
benefits, including, without limitation, any severance and/or change in
control arrangements, for all of Seller's employees (including former
employees, retirees and independent contractors), including the Transferred
Employees, for any periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and (iii)
for any and all Liabilities for compensation and employee benefits,
including, without limitation severance and/or change in control arrangements
for all of Seller's employees (including former employees, retirees and

conditions as those that apply to similarly situated newly hired employees of

predecessor or Subsidiary thereof) as if such service was provided to Parent
solely for purposes of determining amount of vacation time available to the
Transferred Employees. On or prior to the Second Closing, all of the
Transferred Employees shall have utilized their accrued vacation time or been
compensated by the Seller for accrued vacation time through the Second
Closing in accordance with the terms of the Seller's paid time off policy.

 

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.9 to the contrary, nothing in

necessary to conform with applicable Law. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall restrict the ability of Purchaser and/or Parent to terminate the
employment of any Transferred Employee for any reason at any time following
the Second Closing. No provision of this Section 4.9 shall create any third

employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter.

 

 

(i) At least five Business Days prior to its distribution, the Seller shall

Key Products Employee relating to the Transactions and shall provide
Purchaser with an opportunity to make reasonable revisions thereto within

confidentiality covenant or similar restriction that would prohibit or
otherwise restrict or limit such Transferred Employee's employment with
Parent, Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of Parent and (B) waive any and all
right that the Seller or its Subsidiaries may have to seek any damages,
equitable remedies or other relief as a result of such Transferred Employee's
employment with Parent, Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of Parent.

 

 

Section 4.10 Further Assurances. In the event that (a) at any time after the
First Closing Date any further action is necessary or desirable to fully
effect the First Closing Transactions or (b) at any time after the Second
Closing Date any further action is necessary or desirable to fully effect the
Second Closing Transactions, each of the parties hereto shall take, or cause
to be taken, such further action (including (i) transferring back to the
Seller or its designated Affiliate any asset or liability not contemplated by
this Agreement to be a Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability, respectively,
which asset or liability was transferred to Purchaser at or before the Second
Closing, (ii) transferring to Purchaser any asset or liability contemplated
by this Agreement to be a Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability,
respectively, which was not transferred to Purchaser at or before the First

reasonably request, at the sole cost and expense of the requesting party
(unless otherwise specified herein).

 

 

Section 4.11 Seller Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.

 

 

(a) For a period of five years from and after the First Closing Date, except
as provided in the Work Plan, neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall, directly or indirectly, engage in, own, have any financial interest in
(other than a financial interest in a publicly held corporation whose stock
is traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the counter market
which financial interest (held directly or indirectly) does not exceed five
percent (5%) of such company's outstanding securities), manage or operate
anywhere in the United States, a business the same as, substantially similar
to, or which materially competes with, the business of developing, marketing
or manufacturing product candidates INS-19 Granulocyte Colony Stimulating
Factor and INS-20 Pegylated Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor.

 

 

(b) For a period of five years from and after the Second Closing Date,
neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly,
engage in, own, have any financial interest in (other than a financial
interest in a publicly held corporation whose stock is traded on a national
securities exchange or in the over-the counter market which financial
interest (held directly or indirectly) does not exceed five percent (5%) of
such company's outstanding securities), manage or operate anywhere in the
United States, a business the same as, substantially similar to, or which
materially competes with, the business of developing, marketing or
manufacturing the Key Products.

 

 

(c) For a period of five years following the Second Closing Date, the Seller
shall not, and the Seller shall cause its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates,
not to, for its or their own account or for the account of any other Person
(i) encourage any supplier of any materials related to the manufacture of Key
Products to terminate or alter such relationship to the disadvantage of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, (ii) encourage any Person not to enter
into a business relationship with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or (iii)
impair or attempt to impair any relationships between Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates and any of their respective customers, clients, suppliers or other

years from and after the Second Closing Date, neither the Seller nor any of
its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or
employ any Key Products Employee, or request, induce or advise any Key
Products Employee to leave the employ of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
without the prior written consent of Purchaser; provided, that a general
offer of employment to the public shall not be deemed prohibited hereunder as
long as not specifically directed at Key Products Employees.

 

 

(e) The nature and scope of the foregoing protection has been carefully
considered by the parties hereto. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge
that the duration, scope and geographic areas applicable to such provisions
are fair, reasonable and necessary and that adequate compensation has been
received by the Seller for such obligations. If, however, for any reason any
court determines that any such restrictions are not reasonable or that
consideration is inadequate, such restrictions shall be interpreted, modified
or rewritten to include as much of the duration, scope and geographic area
identified in this Section 4.11 as will render such restrictions valid and
enforceable.

 

 

(f) In the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Section 4.11,
Purchaser shall be entitled, without the posting of a bond, to an injunction
restraining such breach. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as
prohibiting any party from pursuing any other remedy available to it for such
breach or threatened breach.

expense, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
all Transfer Taxes, provided, however, that if required by applicable Law,

Assets (the "Apportioned Obligations"), shall be prorated between the Seller
and Purchaser, with such Taxes being borne by the Seller based on the ratio
of the number of days in the relevant period prior to and including the First
Closing Date, with respect to the First Closing Assets, or the Second Closing
Date, with respect to the Second Closing Assets, to the total number of days
in the actual taxable period with respect to which such Taxes are assessed,

such Taxes being borne by Purchaser based on the ratio of the number of days
in the relevant period after the First Closing Date, with respect to the
First Closing Assets, or the Second Closing Date, with respect to the Second

respect to which such Taxes are assessed, irrespective of when such Taxes are

such Apportioned Obligation, the paying party shall present a statement to
the non-paying party setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the
paying party is entitled under Section 4.12(b), together with such supporting
evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount to be reimbursed.
The non-paying party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event
later than ten days after the presentation of such statement.

 

 

(d) Allocation of Purchase Price. At least 15 days prior to the Second
Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Parent for Parent\'s
review, comment and approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, a
statement setting forth the allocation, of the Purchase Price (including the

respect to such allocation. Both the Seller and Purchaser agree to
report, act and file all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent
with the agreed upon allocation (the "Allocation"), and neither the Seller
nor Purchaser shall take any position for Tax purposes (whether in audits,
Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such Allocation unless,
and then only to the extent, required by a final "determination" as defined
in Section 1313(a) of the Code.

 

 

Section 4.13 Mail; Payments.

 

 

(a) The Seller authorizes and empowers Purchaser on and after the Second

Retained Liabilities which have been mistakenly sent after the Second Closing
Date to Parent or Purchaser and which should have been sent to the Seller.

at its own cost and expense, remove all inventory of Excluded Assets from the
Boulder Facilities.

 

 

Section 4.15 Notices to Debt, Option and Warrant Holders. The Seller shall

the terms of any outstanding options, warrants and convertible debt
instruments of the Seller, including the terms of the Seller Convertible
Notes, which may be required as a result of the execution of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions.

 

 

Section 4.16 Release under Security for Assumed Boulder Leases. The parties
shall cooperate in seeking the release, effective as of the Second Closing,
of any security deposit, cash collateral, letter of credit, line of credit or
other surety posted by the Seller and held by the landlord(s) or financial
institution(s) issuing letter(s) of credit as security under the Assumed

Section 6.1(c)(iv), the Seller shall have the right to repurchase the First

Right arises as a result of a termination by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to

paid by the Seller to Purchaser for the First Closing Assets will be equal
