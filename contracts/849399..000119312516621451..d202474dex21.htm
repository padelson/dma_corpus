Units and New Restricted Stock Units_. On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any party hereto, Company Stockholder,
Company Optionholder, holder of New Performance Stock Units, New Restricted
Stock Units or any other Person:

(i) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock, including any
Unvested Company Shares, held by a Converting Holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and shares that are owned by the
Company as treasury stock) shall be cancelled and automatically converted into
the right to receive, subject to and in accordance with _Section 1.4_ (and
with respect to any Unvested Company Shares, in accordance with _Section
1.3(a)(iv)_), an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per Share
Merger Consideration. The amount of cash each Converting Holder holding
shares of Company Common Stock is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Section 1.3(a)(i)_ for such shares of Company Common Stock shall be rounded
down to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all
shares of Company Common Stock held by such Converting Holder.

(ii) _Company Options_. Each Company Option that is not an Excluded Option,
whether subject to time-based vesting or performance-based vesting, vested or
unvested, including any Company Option that has an exercise price per share
that is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration (such
option, an " _Out-Of-The-Money Option_ "), that is unexpired, unexercised and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed and
converted by Acquirer into the right to receive the option to purchase, on
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time ( _provided_ that such terms
shall, other than as otherwise agreed between the applicable Continuing
Employee and Acquirer in any Reinvestment Agreement, take into effect any
acceleration of vesting that occurs at or prior to the Effective Time or
otherwise in connection with, or as a result of, the Transactions), that
number of whole shares of Acquirer Common Stock equal to the product (rounded
down to the next whole number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock, with no cash
being payable for any fractional share eliminated by such rounding) of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied_ _by_ (y) the Option
Exchange Ratio (an " _Assumed Option_ "), with the per share exercise price of
such Assumed Option on a per Acquirer Common Stock share basis equal to,
rounded up to the nearest cent, (A) the per share exercise price of such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided_ _by_ (B) the
Option Exchange Ratio. The Company shall, prior to the Closing, take or cause
to be taken all actions within its power as may be reasonably required to
effect the treatment of Company Options pursuant to this _Section
1.3(a)(ii)_. Each Excluded Option, whether subject to time-based vesting or
performance-based vesting, vested or unvested, that is unexpired, unexercised
and outstanding at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Acquirer, Merger Sub, the Company or any
holder thereof, shall be cancelled at the Effective Time, and in exchange
therefor, each holder of such Excluded Option shall be entitled to receive, in
consideration of the cancellation of such Excluded Option: an amount in cash,
without interest, 

 



5  equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Excluded Option _multiplied_ _by_ (2) the excess, if any, of
the Per Share Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such
Excluded Option. For the avoidance of doubt, no holder of a Company Option
that is an Assumed Option shall be entitled to any payment with respect to
such Company Option at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, any
Excluded Option that is an Out-Of-The-Money Option shall be cancelled with no
consideration therefor.

(iii)  _New Performance Stock Units and New Restricted Stock Units_. Each New
Performance Stock Unit and New Restricted Stock Unit issued as contemplated by
_Section 5.9(d)_ that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed and converted by Acquirer in
accordance with _Section 5.10_. As set forth in _Section 5.10_, each assumed
New Performance Stock Unit and New Restricted Stock Unit that immediately
prior to the Effective Time was not fully vested shall be subject to the same
vesting arrangements that were applicable to such New Performance Stock Unit
or New Restricted Stock Unit, as the case may be, immediately prior to or at
the Effective Time, and no vesting acceleration shall occur by reason of the
Merger.

(iv) _Unvested Company Shares_. The payment of cash pursuant to  _Section
1.3(a)(i)_ in exchange for Unvested Company Shares shall be subject to the
same restrictions and vesting arrangements that were applicable to such
Unvested Company Shares on or immediately prior to the Agreement Date (or, in
the case of any Unvested Company Shares issued after the Agreement Date or
any modification to any Unvested Company Shares issued on or prior to the
Agreement Date, such restrictions and vesting arrangements as agreed by
Acquirer (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed)) ( _provided_ that such terms shall, other than as otherwise agreed
between the applicable Continuing Employee and Acquirer in any applicable
Offer Letter or Reinvestment Agreement, take into effect any acceleration of
vesting that occurs at or prior to the Effective Time or otherwise in
connection with, or as a result of, the Transactions). Accordingly, cash
otherwise payable or issuable pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)(i)_ in exchange
for the Unvested Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (" _Unvested Consideration_ ") shall be retained by
Acquirer and shall not be payable by Acquirer at the Effective Time,
and shall instead become payable by Acquirer on, and only upon the occurrence
of the date that such Unvested Company Shares would have become vested under
the vesting schedule in place for such shares immediately prior to or at the
Effective Time (subject to the restrictions and other terms of such vesting
schedule and giving effect to any agreement between the applicable Continuing
Employee and Acquirer in any applicable Offer Letter or any acceleration
and/or vesting protections not waived pursuant to such Offer Letter).
Acquirer will make all such required payments to holders of Unvested
Consideration no later than the last day of the calendar month in which such
Unvested Consideration would have become vested under the original vesting
schedule and in its discretion may make such payments through a paying agent
authorized by Acquirer to administer such payments on Acquirers behalf. All
amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 1.3(a)(iv)_ shall be subject to
any required payroll and income tax withholding and shall be paid without
interest. A portion of such newly vested cash so distributed may be treated as
imputed interest for federal income tax purposes to the extent required under
the Code and the regulations thereunder. All outstanding rights to repurchase
Unvested Company Shares that the Company may hold or similar restrictions in
the Companys favor immediately prior to the Effective Time (all such rights,
" _Repurchase Rights_ ") shall, to the extent assignable by the Company
without consent, be automatically assigned to Acquirer in the Merger without
any further action and shall thereafter be exercisable by Acquirer upon the
same terms and subject to the same conditions that were in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time (as such may be amended pursuant to the terms of
an Offer Letter, as applicable), except that Repurchase Rights may be
exercised by Acquirer retaining the Unvested Consideration into which such
Unvested Company Shares have been converted and paying to the former holder
thereof the repurchase price in effect for each such share subject to that
Repurchase Right immediately prior to the Effective Time. No Unvested
Consideration, or right thereto, may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or
transferred

 



6  (including any transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other than
Acquirer, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any Liability of such Person, prior to the distribution to
such Person of such Unvested Consideration in accordance with this Agreement.

(b) _Treatment of Company Common Stock Owned by the Company_. At the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment of any
cash or other property or consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquirer, Merger Sub or
any other Person, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the
shares of the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub
capital stock are so converted, shall be the only shares of the
Surviving Corporations capital stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately after the Effective Time). From and after the Effective Time, each
certificate evidencing ownership of a number of shares of Merger Sub capital
stock, will evidence ownership of such number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the Agreement Date and prior to the
Effective Time, all references herein to specified numbers of shares of any
class or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are
based upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading prices
therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent
necessary to provide the parties the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or
other like change.

(e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive
the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, but shall instead be
converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL.
Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the DGCL, becomes entitled
to payment thereunder for such shares shall receive payment therefor in
accordance with the DGCL (but only after the value therefor shall have been
agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the
Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting
Shares, then any such shares shall immediately be deemed to have converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration in respect of such shares as if such shares never had
been Dissenting Shares, and Acquirer shall issue and deliver to the holder
thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable after) the applicable
time or times specified in _Section 1.4(a)_, following the satisfaction of
the applicable conditions set forth in  _Section 1.4(a)_, the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration as if such shares never had been
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall provide to Acquirer (i) reasonably prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal or purchase received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments related to such demands
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the exclusive
right to conduct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Acquirer (which shall be granted or withheld in Acquirers sole
discretion), or as otherwise required under the DGCL, voluntarily make any
payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any claim or demand in respect of any Dissenting Shares. The payout of
consideration under this Agreement to the Converting Holders (other than in
respect of Dissenting Shares, which shall be treated as provided in this
_Section 1.3(e)_ and under the DGCL) shall not be affected by the exercise or
potential exercise of appraisal rights under the DGCL by any other Company
Stockholder.

 



7 (f) _No Interest_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
no interest shall accumulate on any cash payable in connection with the
consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions.

(a) _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, to the extent

terms, except as such enforceability may be subject to Applicable Law

Effective Time.

2.3 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of

capital stock of or any other equity or ownership interest in, directly or

Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the

its properties and to carry on its business as currently conducted. Each
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (to the extent applicable) as a foreign organization in each
jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership, leasing,
holding or use of its properties makes such qualification necessary, except
such other jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or
in good standing would not reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company has made available
an accurate and complete copy of each Subsidiarys Organizational Documents,
each as amended and in full force and effect as of the Agreement Date. None
of the Subsidiaries has violated its Organizational Documents in any material
respect. _Schedule 2.5(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists, with

of any outstanding Equity Interest therein, is set forth on _Schedule
2.5(b)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(ii) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other equity or ownership
interest in, each Subsidiary is owned by the Company, directly or indirectly,

to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity

parties), (iii) the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to be obligated to pay
any royalties or other fees or consideration with respect to Intellectual

government, university, college, other educational institution, or research
center were used in the development of the Company Intellectual Property.

any license or right to material Company Intellectual Property. To the
Companys knowledge, no current or former Employee, consultant or independent
contractor of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries who created or developed
any material Company Intellectual Property was performing services for any

Technology_ ") in a manner that, with respect to Company-Owned Technology that
is material to the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries (" _Company
Proprietary Technology_ "), would (i) require disclosure or distribution of
such Company Proprietary Technology in source code form, (ii) require
the licensing of such Company Proprietary Technology or associated Company-
Owned Intellectual Property Rights for the purpose of making derivative works
thereof or (iii) impose any material restriction on the consideration to be
charged for the distribution of such Company Proprietary Technology or
Company-Owned Intellectual Property Rights. The Company and each of the
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
licenses for any such Open Source Technology. 

 



23 (o) _Source Code_. Neither the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, nor any
other Person acting on its or their behalf, has disclosed, delivered or

agreements that prohibit use or disclosure except in the performances of
services for the Company or any Subsidiary.

 

(p) _Contaminants_. To the Companys knowledge, the Company has not introduced
into its Company Products any undisclosed "back door," "time bomb," "Trojan
horse," "worm," "drop dead device," or "virus" (as such terms are commonly
understood in the software industry) that has the primary purpose of
permitting unauthorized access or the unauthorized disablement or erasure of
such Company Product (except where implemented as an intended design feature)
(" _Contaminants_ "). The Company implements reasonable measures designed to
prevent the introduction of Contaminants into Company Products.

(q) _Security Measures_. The Company and the Subsidiaries have at all

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Since December 8, 2011, neither the Company
nor any of the Subsidiaries has any material liability or obligation (and to
the Companys knowledge, there is no basis for any present or future action,
suit, proceeding, hearing, charge, complaint, claim, demand or Governmental
Entity investigation against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries giving
rise to any material liability or obligation) for replacement or repair of any
Company Product except liabilities or obligations for replacement or repair

directly or indirectly to liability under Section 4975 of the Code or Sections

claims or proceedings pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened

Company Employee Plan or Legally Required Plan (to the extent such plan is
maintained by the Company or one of the Subsidiaries). The Company has not
undertaken to maintain any Company Employee Plan for any period of time and
each Company Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise
discontinued on or after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms,
without liability to the Company, any of the Subsidiaries, Acquirer or any of
its ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses typically
incurred in a termination event). To the Companys knowledge, there are no
audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or threatened in writing by the IRS,
DOL or any other Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries with respect to any Company Employee Plan. All annual
reports and other filings required by the IRS, DOL or any other similar
Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries have been timely made. Neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any penalty or Tax with

prior to Closing, withdraw the Registration Statement and cease to take any
material actions in furtherance of a public offering of Company Capital Stock.
If any of the Companys Representatives, whether in his, her or its capacity
as such or in any other capacity, takes any action that the Company is
obligated pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ not to authorize or permit such
Representative to take, then the Company shall be deemed for all purposes of
this Agreement to have breached this _Section 5.2_.

 



47 (b) Unless prohibited by Applicable Law or confidentiality obligations, the
Company shall immediately (but in any event, within 24 hours) notify Acquirer
orally and in writing after receipt by the Company in the event that such
notice occurs following the Agreement Date (or, to the knowledge of the
Company, by any of the Companys Representatives), of (i) any Acquisition
Proposal or (ii) any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. Unless prohibited by Applicable Law or confidentiality obligations,
such notice shall describe (A) the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice
or request and (B) the identity of the Person or Group making any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice
or request. The Company shall provide Acquirer with at least 48 hours prior
notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of
the Board) of any meeting of the Board at which the Board is reasonably
expected to discuss any Acquisition Proposal.

5.3 _Confidentiality; Public Disclosure_.

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Acquirer and the Company have
previously executed a Mutual Confidentiality Agreement dated as of April 24,
2016, as amended (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) The initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions
shall be a joint press release in the form heretofore agreed to by Acquirer
and the Company. After the initial press release, Acquirer and the Company
shall reasonably consult with each other prior to issuing any press release or
other public communications relating to the terms of this Agreement or
the Transactions, except that no such consultation shall be required if such
release or communication (i) is required by Applicable Law, court process or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any securities exchange
( _provided_  that prior to making any required public communications, the
disclosing party will deliver a draft of such announcement to the other party
and shall give such other party a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon)
or (ii) consists solely of information previously disclosed in previous press
releases or public communications made jointly by Acquirer and the Company or
otherwise with the consent of Acquirer or the Company, as applicable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, (x) Acquirer may make disclosure regarding this
Agreement and the Transactions in connection with the Debt Financing and (y)
Acquirer and the Company may make public statements in response to specific
questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such
statements consist solely of information previously disclosed in all material
respects in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements
made jointly by Acquirer and the Company and do not reveal any material, non-
public information regarding the other parties hereto, this Agreement or the
Transactions. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Acquirer will
file this Agreement, in the form executed by the Company and Acquirer,
including a summary thereof, with the SEC.

 

5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Approval_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, and to
cooperate with each other party hereto, to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, appropriate or
desirable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including the
satisfaction of the respective conditions set forth in _Article VI_ , and
including to execute and deliver such other instruments and do and perform
such other acts and things as may be necessary or reasonably desirable for
effecting completely the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions.

 



48 (b) Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, as promptly as
practicable after the Agreement Date (and, in any event, within 15 days after
the Agreement Date; _provided_ that the filing party has received from the
other party all information necessary to make such filing), Acquirer and the
Company shall execute and file, or join in the execution and filing of, any
application, notification (including the provision of any required information
in connection therewith) or other document that may be required under the HSR
Act and any other foreign Applicable Law designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate the exercise of market power (collectively, the " _Antitrust Laws_ ")
in order to obtain the authorization, approval or consent of any Governmental
Entity, or expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
such Antitrust Laws, that may be reasonably required in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions. Acquirer and the
Company shall each use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain,
and to cooperate with each other to obtain promptly, all such authorizations,
approvals, consents, expirations and terminations, and Acquirer and the
Company shall each pay an equal share of any filing fees associated
therewith. Each of Acquirer and the Company shall (i) cooperate and
coordinate with the other in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the other
with any information that may be required in order to make such filings, (iii)
supply any additional information that reasonably may be required or
requested by the United States Federal Trade Commission, the United States
Department of Justice or the Governmental Entities of any other applicable
jurisdiction in which any such filing is made under any other Antitrust Laws
and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws as
soon as practicable, and to obtain any required consents under any other
Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger as soon as practicable, including by
attempting to secure approvals without in-depth investigation by any agency
competent in the enforcement or exercise of Antitrust Laws and to avoid any
impediment to the consummation of the Merger under any Antitrust Laws,
including taking all such action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve
such objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the
United States Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity or
Person may assert under any applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Merger to obtain clearance of the Merger.

 

(c) Acquirer shall, to the extent reasonably necessary to achieve the outcomes
described in _Section 5.4(b)_, effect or commit to, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, or otherwise, (i) the sale, divestiture, license or other
disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Acquirer or
its subsidiaries or the Company or the Subsidiaries, and (ii) the imposition
of any limitation or regulation on the ability of Acquirer, Merger Sub or its
subsidiaries or the Company or the Subsidiaries to freely conduct their
business or own such assets (an " _Antitrust Required Action_ "), in each
case unless taking such Antitrust Required Action would or would reasonably be
likely to materially and negatively affect the benefits reasonably expected to
be obtained in the Transactions by Acquirer (any of the foregoing having such
an effect, an " _Antitrust Restraint_ ").

(d) Each of Acquirer and the Company shall promptly (and in any event within
48 hours) inform the other of any material communication between such party
and any Governmental Entity regarding any of the Transactions. If Acquirer or
Merger Sub (or any of their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one
hand, or the Company, on the other hand, shall receive a request for
additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Transactions pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Laws with respect to which any such filings have been made, then
such party shall make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable
and after consultation with such other party, an appropriate response
in compliance with such request. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, to the extent reasonably practicable and unless

 



49  prohibited by Applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity, each
of Acquirer and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable),
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall (i) give each
other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Entity
relating to the Merger, (ii) give each other an opportunity to participate in
each of such meetings, (iii) keep such other party reasonably apprised with
respect to any oral communications with any Governmental Entity regarding the
Merger, (iv) cooperate in the filing of any analyses, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or other written communications
explaining or defending the Merger, articulating any regulatory or competitive
argument and/or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental
Entity, (v) provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity
to review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the views of the other
with respect to, all written communications (including any analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and opinions) with a Governmental
Entity regarding the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be
withheld or redacted as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and
with Applicable Law, (vi) provide each other (or counsel of each party, as
appropriate) with copies of all written communications to or from any
Governmental Entity relating to the Merger, and (vii) cooperate and provide
each other with a reasonable opportunity to participate in, and consider in
good faith the views of the other with respect to, all material deliberations
with respect to all efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth in this
_Section 5.4_. Any such disclosures, rights to participate or provisions of
information by one party to the other may be made on a counsel-only basis to
the extent required under Applicable Law or as appropriate to protect
confidential business information.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants contained in this
_Section 5.4_, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding,
including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other Transactions as violating
any Applicable Law or Order, or if any Applicable Law or Order is enacted,
entered, promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Entity which would make
illegal, or would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay, the
Merger or any other Transactions, Acquirer and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall use reasonable best efforts to
contest any such action or proceeding and use all reasonable efforts to have
vacated or otherwise lifted any such Applicable Law or Order, including, in
the case of Acquirer, by effecting or committing to an Antitrust Required
Action so long as it does not constitute an Antitrust Restraint.

 

5.5 _Third-Party Consents; Notices_.

 

(a) Following consultation with Acquirer, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the Closing, and deliver to Acquirer at
or prior to the Closing, all consents, waivers and approvals under each
Contract listed or described on _Schedule 2.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (and any Contract entered into after the Agreement Date that would have
been required to be listed or described on _Schedule 2.4(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter if entered into prior to the Agreement Date).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be
required prior to the Effective Time to pay any consent or other similar fee,
"profit sharing" or other similar payment or other consideration (including
increased rent or other similar payments or any amendments, supplements or
other modifications to (or waivers of) the existing terms of any Contract),
or the provision of additional security (including a guaranty) to obtain the
consent, waiver or approval of any Person under any Contract.

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.3_, the Company shall (and shall cause each
Subsidiary to) give all notices and other information required to be given to
the employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries, any union, works council,
or similar labor entity or employee representation group representing any
group of employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and any
applicable Governmental Entity under WARN, the National Labor Relations Act,
as amended, the Code, Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act and other
Applicable Law in connection with the Transactions.

 



50 5.6 _Notices of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) notify Acquirer
in writing promptly after receipt of any written notice of any Legal
Proceeding initiated by or against it, or known by the Company to be
threatened against the Company or any of Subsidiaries, or any of its or their
Employees or the Company Stockholders in their capacity as such that, had it
occurred prior to the Agreement Date, would have constituted an exception to
the representation set forth in the first sentence of _Section 2.20_ (a "
_New Litigation Claim_ "), (ii) notify Acquirer of ongoing
material developments in any New Litigation Claim or any Litigation Claim and
(iii) consult in good faith with Acquirer regarding the conduct of the defense
of any material New Litigation Claim or Litigation Claim.

 

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to notify Acquirer in
writing promptly after receipt of: (i) any written notice or other written
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any written notice
or other written communication from any Governmental Entity or any
official or employee of any Governmental Entity (A) in connection with the
Transactions or (B) indicating that a Company Authorization has been revoked
or is required in any jurisdiction in which such Company Authorization has not
been obtained, which revocation or failure to obtain has had or would
reasonably be expected to be material to Acquirer (following the Effective
Time) or the Company or the Subsidiaries, (iii) any Person asserting or
threatening a claim against the Company or any Subsidiary or with respect to
any of its assets or properties (including Intellectual Property) that is, or
is reasonably likely to be, material to the Company and the Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (iv) any written notice from any Tax Authority, regarding
Taxes payable by the Company or the Subsidiaries that could reasonably be
expected to exceed $1,000,000 or (v) any Change that, individually or in the
aggregate with any other Changes, would reasonably be expected to constitute,
or lead to, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company.

(c) Acquirer shall use its reasonable best efforts to notify the Company in
writing promptly after obtaining knowledge of: (i) any written notice or other
written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any written
notice or other written communication from any Governmental Entity or any
official or employee of any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions or (iii) any Legal Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity being initiated by or against it, or known by Acquirer to
be threatened against Acquirer or any of its respective directors, officers,
employees or stockholders in their capacity as such, or of any written
correspondence from any Person asserting or threatening a claim against
Acquirer that relates to this Agreement or the Transactions, in each of
clauses (i) through (iii) that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay Acquirers ability to consummate the Transactions.

(d) To the extent not otherwise required by this _Section 5.6_, each party
shall notify the other party in writing promptly after obtaining knowledge of
any change, occurrence or event that, individually or in the aggregate with
any other changes, occurrences and events, would reasonably be expected to
cause any of the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VI_ not to
be timely satisfied.

(e) No notification given pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements herein or affect
the satisfaction or non-satisfaction of any conditions to the obligations of
the parties hereto under this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to Acquirer or the Company; _provided_ that this
_Section 5.6_ shall not be a covenant, agreement or obligation for purposes
of _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.3(a)_.

 



51 5.7 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) During the period from the Agreement Date and continuing until the earlier
of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, (i) the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to afford Acquirer and its Representatives
reasonable access during business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to
(A) the Companys and the Subsidiaries properties, personnel, books,
Contracts and records and (B) all other information concerning the business,
results of operations, product development efforts, properties and personnel
of the Company and the Subsidiaries as Acquirer may reasonably request and
(ii) the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide to Acquirer and
its Representatives (at Acquirers cost) true, correct and complete copies of
the Companys and the Subsidiaries (A) internal financial statements, (B)
Tax Returns, Tax elections and all other records and workpapers relating to
Taxes and (C) a schedule of any deferred intercompany gain or loss with
respect to transactions to which the Company or any Subsidiary has been
a party, to the extent available; _provided_ that the Company may restrict
the foregoing access to the extent that (x) compliance with this _Section
5.7_ would destroy any attorney-client privilege of the Company with respect
to such communication or (y) any Applicable Law requires that such party
restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information, or the
terms of any Contract require that such party restrict or prohibit access to
such Contract or such access would result in a breach of, or default or
acceleration or termination right under, any Contract; _provided_ , _further_
, that the Company shall use reasonable best efforts (at Acquirers cost) to
seek and obtain any Third Persons consent to disclosure of such documents
and information. In the event that the Company does not provide access or
information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall notify Acquirer in
writing that it is withholding information based on this _Section 5.7_ and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable
information to Acquirer in a way that would not violate the Applicable Law,
Contract or obligation to or waive such privilege with respect to such
communication.

(b) No information or knowledge obtained by Acquirer during the pendency of
the Transactions in any investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement, obligation or condition set forth herein. Nothing in this _Section
5.7_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to require the
Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the
foregoing to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other
information (unless reasonably available to the Company under its
current reporting systems or otherwise prepared in the ordinary course of
business). Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by
this _Section 5.7_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and the
Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties
of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries shall be subject to the Companys
reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall not include
the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by Acquirer
or any of its Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 5.7_.

 

5.8 _Expenses; Company Debt_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except
as otherwise set forth herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring
such expense (it being understood that such cost and expenses for the
Companys account shall be ultimately for the account of the
Company Securityholders pursuant to the definition of "Merger
Consideration"). At and subject to the Closing, Acquirer shall repay or cause
to be repaid all (a) Company Funded Debt outstanding as of the Closing
including the Prepayment Premium and related obligations to the extent
covered in the related payoff letter or redemption notice and (b) all
Transaction Expenses that are unpaid and due as of the Closing.

 



52 5.9 _Employees_.

 

(a) Following the Agreement Date, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with
and assist Acquirer in obtaining an executed Offer Letter, Reinvestment
Agreement and, if applicable, Non-Competition Agreement from each Specified
Employee at or prior to the Closing, in each case in form and substance
acceptable to Acquirer. As a result of the Merger, and except for the Named
Employees each of whom is entering into an Offer Letter as required by this
Agreement, the Specified Employees who enter into an Offer Letter after the
Agreement Date and prior to the Closing Date and as otherwise required by
Applicable Law, each of the current employees of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become or
remain employees of the Surviving Corporation or the appropriate Subsidiary by
operation of law.

 

(b) Prior to Closing and no later than the deadline set forth in the Company
Stock Plan, the Company shall deliver any and all notices required under the
Company Stock Plan to the Company Optionholders with respect to the treatment
of the Company Options under this Agreement.

(c) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA maintained by Acquirer (or any subsidiary of Acquirer) in which any
Continuing Employee will participate effective as of or after the Effective
Time (collectively, " _Acquirer Plans_ "), subject to Applicable Law and
applicable Tax qualification requirements, Acquirer shall recognize all
service of Continuing Employees with the Company and the Subsidiaries for
vesting, eligibility and level of benefits purposes (but not for accrual
purposes, except for vacation and severance) in any Acquirer Plan in which
such Continuing Employees will be eligible to participate after the Effective
Time, in each case except to the extent that recognizing such service would
result in a duplication of benefits. To the extent any Continuing Employee
participates in an Acquirer Plan that is a group health plan of Acquirer (or
any subsidiary of Acquirer) following the Closing Date (an " _Acquirer
Welfare Plan_ "), Acquirer will, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and
any insurer or service provider under the applicable Acquirer Welfare Plan,
cause all participation waiting periods under each Acquirer Welfare Plan that
would otherwise be applicable to such Continuing Employee to be waived to the
same extent waived or satisfied under the Company Employee Plan comparable to
such Acquirer Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if
later, immediately prior to such Continuing Employees commencement of
participation in such Acquirer Welfare Plan.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Company shall adopt the 2016 Equity
Incentive Plan and (ii) the Company shall grant New Performance Stock Units
and/or New Restricted Stock Units for shares of Company Common Stock from the
2016 Equity Incentive Plan to certain of the Employees, in such amounts, and
with such terms as agreed to in writing by Acquirer and the Companys Chief
Executive Officer (including that such New Performance Stock Units and/or New
Restricted Stock Units shall not accelerate by reason of the Merger).

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement, and no Employee or any other Person (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be a third-party beneficiary of
this Agreement (except to the extent provided in _Section 8.8_), and no
provision of this  _Section 5.9_ shall create such rights in any such
Persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or
indirectly, under any Company Employee Plan or Employment Agreement or any
employee program or any plan or arrangement of Acquirer or any of its
subsidiaries or shall be construed to modify, amend, or establish any benefit
plan, program or arrangement or in any way affect the ability of the parties
hereto or any other Person to modify, amend or terminate any of its benefit
plans, programs or arrangements or terminate the employment or service of any
Employee.)

 



53 5.10 _Assumption of New Performance Stock Units and New Restricted Stock
Units_. At the Effective Time, each New Performance Stock Unit and New
Restricted Stock Unit that is unexpired shall be assumed by Acquirer. Each
such New Performance Stock Unit and New Restricted Stock Unit so assumed by
Acquirer under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions (including, if applicable, the vesting arrangements
and other terms and conditions set forth in the plan under which such New
Performance Stock Units or New Restricted Stock Units were issued and the
applicable notice of grant of stock unit or other applicable agreement) as are
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that such New
Performance Stock Unit or New Restricted Stock Unit shall be settled by
the issuance of that number of whole shares of Acquirer Common Stock equal to
the product (rounded down to the next whole number of shares of Acquirer
Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional share eliminated
by such rounding) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon settlement of such New Performance Stock Unit or New Restricted
Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the Equity
Exchange Ratio. Consistent with the terms of the plan under which such New
Performance Stock Units and New Restricted Stock Units will be issued and the
applicable notice of grant of stock unit or other applicable agreement, the
Merger shall not terminate any of the outstanding New Performance Stock Units
and New Restricted Stock Units under such plan or accelerate the
exercisability or vesting of such New Performance Stock Units or New
Restricted Stock Units or the shares of Acquirer Common Stock that shall be
subject to those New Performance Stock Units or New Restricted Stock Units,
as the case may be, upon Acquirers assumption in the Merger. Promptly after
the Closing Date, Acquirer shall issue to each Person who immediately prior to
the Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding New Performance Stock Unit
and/or New Restricted Stock Units a document evidencing the foregoing
assumption by Acquirer.

 

5.11 _Form S-8_. Acquirer will use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Acquirer Common Stock issuable upon exercise of any Assumed Options or the
settlement of assumed New Performance Stock Units or New Restricted Stock
Units to be registered with the SEC on Form S-8 as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date but in any event within 5 Business Days following
the Closing Date (assuming Form S-8 is available for such registration and
timely receipt of the Spreadsheet and, all restricted stock unit documentation
relating to the New Performance Stock Units and New Restricted Stock Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, which registration shall
also cover reoffers and resales of Acquirer Common Stock received upon such
exercise and settlement), will exercise reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such Assumed
Options or assumed New Performance Stock Units and New Restricted Stock Units
remain outstanding and will reserve a sufficient number of shares of Acquirer
Common Stock for issuance upon exercise or settlement thereof. If so
requested by Acquirer, the Company and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate
with and assist Acquirer in the preparation of such Form S-8 registration
statement. The Form S-8 registration statement shall not cover the shares
of Acquirer Common Stock subject to any Assumed Options, New Performance
Stock Units or New Restricted Stock Units assumed by Acquirer that are held by
Persons who do not become employees of Acquirer or the Surviving Corporation
at the Effective Time or do not otherwise have a service relationship with
Acquirer or an Affiliate of Acquirer at the Effective Time.

5.12 _Termination of Benefit Plans_. Except as otherwise requested by
Acquirer, effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the
Company shall terminate the Company Employee Plans intended to include a
Section 401(k) arrangement (unless Acquirer provides written notice to the
Company no later than ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date that such
401(k) plans shall not be terminated). The Company shall provide Acquirer with
evidence that such 401(k) plans and the Company Stock Plan have been
terminated (effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board or any applicable committee
thereof. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
reasonable and good faith review and approval by Acquirer. The Company

 



54  also shall (i) take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such
401(k) plans as Acquirer may reasonably require and (ii) cooperate with
Acquirer with respect to the termination of any other Company Plans that are
"employee benefit plans" within the meaning of ERISA, to the extent terminable
by the Company without any action or consent of any other Person and without
cost to the Company, which are identified by Acquirer.

5.13 _Certain Closing Certificates and Documents_.

 

(a) The Company shall prepare and deliver to Acquirer a draft of the Company
Closing Transaction Expenses Certificate not later than five Business Days
prior to the proposed Closing Date (the " _Draft Delivery Date_ "). The
Company shall provide to Acquirer, together with the Company Closing
Transaction Expenses Certificate, such supporting documentation, information
and calculations as are reasonably necessary for Acquirer to verify and
determine the calculations, amounts and other matters set forth in the Company
Closing Transaction Expenses Certificate, including (i) with respect to
the Transaction Expenses described under clauses (a), (b) and, to the extent
paid to the Bain Purchasers or their Affiliates, (f) (such clauses embedded in
the definition of "Transaction Expenses"), written acknowledgments
pursuant to which any Person that is entitled to any Transaction Expenses
acknowledges (A) the total amount of Transaction Expenses that has been
incurred or will be incurred by such Person after the Lockbox Date (including
any of such amounts that have been paid by the Company after the Lockbox Date
and prior to the Closing with respect to such amounts) and (B) that, upon
payment of such remaining payable amount at the Closing, it shall be paid in
full with respect to any Transaction Expenses and shall not be owed any other
amounts that would be Transaction Expenses by any of Acquirer, the Company,
its Affiliates and/or the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that if
the Company is unable to obtain any written acknowledgement described in this
clause (i) following good faith efforts, the Company shall provide Acquirer
with its good faith estimate of the final amount of any such Transaction
Expenses and include such amount on the Company Closing Transaction
Expenses Certificate and (ii) with respect to any other Transaction Expenses,
to the extent practicable, final invoices for the Transaction Expenses. The
Company shall give, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to give, and shall
instruct its Representatives and auditors to give Acquirer and its
Representatives and auditors, all such reasonable access (including electronic
access, to the extent reasonably available) during normal business hours (or
such other times as the parties hereto may agree) and in a manner so as not
to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the Business, as Acquirer may
reasonably require to the books and records of the Company and the
Subsidiaries and to personnel or Representatives of the Company (including to
finance personnel) for any reasonable purpose relating to the review of the
Company Closing Transaction Expenses Certificate. As promptly as practicable
after the Draft Delivery Date, Acquirer shall notify the Company of those
items and amounts as to which Acquirer disagrees and Acquirer and the Company
shall negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on the disputed items and
amounts. The Company shall deliver the final version of the Company Closing
Transaction Expenses Certificate (the " _Final Company Closing Transaction
Expenses Certificate_ ") (which final version shall be revised by the Company
in good faith with respect to the reasonable comments of Acquirer on the
Company Closing Transaction Expenses Certificate) not later than two Business
Days prior to the proposed Closing Date.

(b) The Company shall prepare and deliver to Acquirer not later than five
Business Days prior to the proposed Closing Date a draft of its good faith
estimate of a spreadsheet (the " _Spreadsheet_ ") in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer, which spreadsheet shall be dated as of
the Closing Date and shall set forth all of the following information, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) the names of all of the
Converting Holders and, where available, their respective addresses and work
e-mail addresses, (ii) the number and type of shares of Company Common Stock
held by, and subject to the Company Options, New Performance Stock Units and
New Restricted Stock Units, in each case held by such Converting Holders and,
in the case of certificated shares, the respective certificate numbers, if
applicable, (iii) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock in
effect

 



55  for each Company Option, (iv) the vesting status and schedule with respect
to each Company Option, New Performance Stock Unit, New Restricted Stock Unit
and Unvested Company Share, (v) the calculation of Fully-Diluted Company
Common Stock, Merger Consideration and Per Share Merger Consideration, (vi)
the calculation of aggregate cash amounts payable to each such Converting
Holder pursuant to  _Section 1.3(a)_ and, in the case of any Reinvestment
Stockholders, the Cash Reinvestment Portion to be subtracted therefrom and

that were subject to the stockholder vote (the " _280G Stockholder Approval_
") or (b) the 280G Stockholder Approval was not obtained and as a
consequence, that such payments and/or benefits shall not be made or provided

affected individuals prior to the solicitation of the vote of the holders of

correct with respect to such specified date or dates), other than for such

receipt by the Company of written notice of such inaccuracy or breach and, if
not cured within such period and at or prior to the Closing, such inaccuracy
or breach would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in

cure period shall be available or applicable to any such breach that by its
nature cannot be cured), or (ii) the Company Stockholder Approval is not

breach shall not have been cured within ten Business Days after receipt by
Acquirer of written notice of such inaccuracy or breach and, if not cured
within such period and at or prior to the Closing, such breach would result
in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ or
_Section 6.2_ to be satisfied ( _provided_ that no such cure period shall be
available or applicable to any such inaccuracy or breach that by its nature
cannot be cured); _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement

(Confidentiality; Public Disclosure), _Section 5.8_ (Expenses; Company Debt),
this _Section 7.2_ (Effect of Termination), _Article Article VIII_ (General

shall relieve any party hereto from Liability in connection with any
intentional fraud, committed with actual knowledge, or a Willful Breach of any
covenant, agreement or obligation of, such party herein.

 

 _ARTICLE VIII _

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

8.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. If the Merger is
consummated, the representations and warranties made by the Company herein
and in the certificates contemplated by this Agreement shall expire and be of
no further force or effect as of the Closing. If the Merger is consummated,
the representations and warranties made by Acquirer and Merger Sub herein and
in the certificates contemplated by this Agreement shall expire and be of no
further force or effect as of the Closing. If the Merger is consummated, all
covenants, agreements and obligations of the parties hereto shall expire and
be of no further force or effect as of the Closing, except with respect to
the obligations of Acquirer and Merger Sub to make the payments provided for
in _Article I_ and to the extent such covenants, agreements and obligations
provide that they are to be performed after the Closing. None of the
covenants of any party required to be performed by such party before the
Closing will survive the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, it is the intention of the parties hereto, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, that the provisions of this _Section 8.1_
supersede any applicable statutes of limitations with respect to the
applicable representations and warranties. Acquirer and Merger Sub (on
behalf of themselves and their Affiliates and Representatives (including,
following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries of the
Surviving Corporation)) hereby waive, from and after the Closing, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims for intentional fraud,
committed with actual knowledge, with respect to representations and
warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement) which Acquirer or Merger Sub
or any of their Affiliates and Representatives may have against the Company
or any of its Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person arising under
or based upon this Agreement (other than as may be set forth in any Letter of
Transmittal or Transaction Document).

8.3 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. It is acknowledged by each of
the parties hereto that the Company has retained Ropes and Gray LLP (" _Ropes_
") to act as its counsel in connection with the Transactions and that Ropes
has not acted as counsel for any other party hereto in connection with the
Transactions (the " _Acquisition Engagement_ "). Each of Acquirer and the
Company hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company Securityholders, on the other
hand, Ropes may represent any or all of the Company Securityholders in such
dispute even though the interests of the Company Securityholders may be
directly adverse to Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective subsidiaries, without the need for any future waiver or consent,
and even though Ropes formerly may have represented the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that this sentence shall not apply if Ropes previously had handled
or, at the time of such dispute, is handling any ongoing matters substantially
related to such dispute for Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective subsidiaries. To

 



67  the extent that any communication between the Company or the Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and Ropes, on the other hand, directly relates to the
Acquisition Engagement and such dispute, such communication shall, for so
long as the confidentiality of such communication is preserved by the parties
thereto, be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the
Company Securityholders, and not the Company or Surviving Corporation ("
_Confidential Communications_ "). Neither Acquirer nor any of its Affiliates,
including the Surviving Corporation, shall have access to (and Acquirer hereby
waives, on behalf of each, any right of access it may otherwise have with
respect to) any files or work product of Ropes, to the extent that they
include Confidential Communications, whether or not the Closing occurs.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Acquirer acknowledges and
agrees, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, including the Surviving
Corporation, upon and after the Closing: (i) the Company Securityholders and
Ropes shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect
to the Confidential Communications, and neither Acquirer nor any of its
Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, shall be a holder thereof,
(ii) to the extent that files or work product of Ropes in respect of the
Acquisition Engagement constitute property of the client, only the Company
Securityholders shall hold such property rights and have the right to waive or
modify such property rights with respect to the Confidential Communications
and (iii) Ropes shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
Confidential Communications to Acquirer or any of its Affiliates, including
the Surviving Corporation, by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Ropes and the Company or otherwise; _provided_ that, to the
extent any communication includes Confidential Communications, Ropes shall
provide appropriately redacted versions of such communications, files or work
product to Acquirer or its Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in the event that
a dispute arises between any of Acquirer or the Surviving Corporation or their
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of the Company Securityholders, on the
other hand, concerning the matters contemplated in this Agreement, Acquirer,
for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates and the Surviving Corporation and
its Affiliates, agrees that Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation and their
Affiliates shall not offer into evidence or otherwise attempt to use or
assert Confidential Communications against the Company Securityholders.

8.4 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made herein to Articles, Sections,
subsections, Schedules or Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Article,
Section or subsection of, or a Schedule or an Exhibit to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The headings contained herein are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein
shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Where a reference is made to a Contract, instrument (other than
the Registration Statement) or Applicable Law, such reference is to such
Contract, instrument or Applicable Law as amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of Contracts or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of Applicable Law) by succession of comparable successor law and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires (a) words of
any gender include each other gender and neutral forms of such words, (b)
words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular
number, respectively, (c) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereto," "hereunder"
and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement, (d) references
to clauses without a cross-reference to a Section or subsection are
references to clauses within the same Section or, if more specific,
subsection, (e) references to any Person include the successors and permitted
assigns of that Person, (f) references from or through any date shall
mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and
including, respectively.(g) the phrases "provide to" and "deliver to" and
phrases of similar import mean that a true, correct and complete paper or
electronic copy of the information or material referred to has been delivered
to the party to whom such information or material is to be provided and (h)
the phrase "made available to" and phrases of similar import means, with
respect to any information, document or other material of Acquirer or the
Company, that such information, document or material was made available for
review by the Company or Acquirer, respectively, and its Representatives in
the virtual data room established by Acquirer or the Company,

 



68  respectively, in connection with this Agreement at least 24 hours prior to
the execution of this Agreement or actually delivered (whether by physical or
electronic delivery) to the Company or Acquirer, respectively, or its
Representatives at least 24 hours prior to the execution of this Agreement.
The symbol "$" and references to "dollars" refers to United States Dollars and
all references to currency amounts shall be to United States Dollars unless
explicitly indicated otherwise. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends and such
phrase shall not mean simply "if." All references to "days" shall be to
calendar days unless otherwise indicated as a "Business Day." Any action
otherwise required to be taken on a day that is not a Business Day shall
instead be taken on the next succeeding Business Day, and if the last day of
such period is a non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the
next succeeding Business Day. Unless indicated otherwise, all mathematical
calculations contemplated by this Agreement shall be rounded to the tenth
decimal place, except in respect of payments, which shall be rounded to the
nearest whole United States cent.

8.5 _Amendment_. Subject to Applicable Law, the parties hereto may amend this
Agreement by authorized action at any time pursuant to an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto; _provided_ that after
the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, no amendment shall be made to
this Agreement that by Applicable Law requires further approval by the Company
Stockholders without such further approval. To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, Acquirer and the Company may cause this Agreement to be
amended at any time after the Closing by execution of an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of Acquirer and the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, _Section 7.2_, clause (v) of  _Section 8.8_, the
fifth sentence of _Section 8.11_, the proviso of the first sentence of
_Section 8.12_, the last sentence of _Section 8.12_, _Section 8.14_ and the
penultimate sentence of this  _Section 8.5_ may not be amended, modified,
waived or terminated in a manner that adversely impacts the Debt Financing
Source Related Parties without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing
Sources. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Section
8.8_, the sixth, seventh and eighth sentences of _Section 8.11_, and this
sentence may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that
adversely impacts the SL Investors without the prior written consent of such
SL Investors.

8.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time at or prior to the Closing, any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto owed to such party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, (c) waive any breaches of any of the covenants,
agreements, obligations or conditions for the benefit of such party contained
herein and (d) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for
the benefit of such party contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing that is (A) prior to
the Closing with respect to the Company and/or the Company Securityholders,
signed by the Company and (B) with respect to Acquirer and/or Merger Sub,
signed by Acquirer. Without limiting the generality or effect of the preceding
sentence, no failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right under this
Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right, and no waiver of any breach
or default shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default of the same
or any other provision herein.

 

8.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; it being
understood and agreed that all parties hereto need not sign the same
counterpart. The delivery by facsimile or by electronic delivery in PDF
format of this Agreement with all executed signature pages (in counterparts or
otherwise) shall be sufficient to bind the parties hereto to the terms and
conditions set forth herein. All of the counterparts will together constitute
one and the same instrument and each counterpart will constitute an original
of this Agreement.

 



69 8.8 _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the
Transaction Documents, including all the exhibits attached hereto and
thereto, the Schedules, including the Company Disclosure Letter, (a)
constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue
in full force and effect, and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement, in accordance with its terms and (b) are not intended to confer,
and shall not be construed as conferring, upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder (except that (v) the Debt
Financing Source Related Parties shall be express third party beneficiaries
of and shall be entitled to rely upon the penultimate sentence of _Section
8.5_, the fifth sentence of _Section 8.11_, the proviso in the first sentence
of  _Section 8.12_, the last sentence of _Section 8.12_, _Section 8.14_
and clause (v) of this _Section 8.8_, and each Debt Financing Source Related
Party may enforce such provisions, (w) the SL Investors shall be express
third party beneficiaries of and shall be entitled to rely upon the last
sentence of _Section 8.5_, the sixth, seventh and eighth sentences of
_Section 8.11_ and this clause (w) of this  _Section 8.8_ and each SL
Investor may enforce such provisions, (x) _Section 5.18_ is intended to
benefit the Company Indemnified Parties, and Company Indemnified Parties shall
be express third party beneficiaries of and shall be entitled to rely upon
_Section 5.18_, (y) Ropes shall be an express third party beneficiary of
_Section 8.3_ and (z) the Non-Parties shall be express third party
beneficiaries of and shall be entitled to rely upon _Section 8.11_).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed by the
parties hereto that each of the Company Securityholders is intended to be an
express third-party beneficiary of the rights of such Person to receive the
consideration set forth in _Article I_. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that, prior to the Effective Time, each holder of Equity Interests of
the Company will be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement for the
purpose of pursuing claims for damages (including damages based on the loss
of the economic benefits of the Merger, including the loss of the premium
offered to such holder) and, to the extent such damages are awarded by a
court, enforcing such an award for and accepting damages under this Agreement
in the event of a failure by Acquirer or Merger Sub to effect the Merger as
required by the terms of this Agreement or Willful Breach by Acquirer or
Merger Sub. The rights granted pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
of this _Section 8.8_ will be enforceable only by the Company in its sole and
absolute discretion, on behalf of the Company Securityholders.

 

8.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights and obligations
under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment without
such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that
Acquirer and/or Merger Sub may assign its rights and delegate all or a
portion of its obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Acquirer without the prior consent of any other
party hereto; _provided_ that notwithstanding any such assignment, Acquirer
and/or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall remain liable for all of its
obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

8.10 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



70 8.11 _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance; Non-Recourse_. The parties
hereto understand and agree that the covenants and undertakings herein
contained are uniquely related to the desire of the parties hereto to
consummate the Transactions, that the Transactions represent a unique business
opportunity at a unique time for each of the parties hereto and further agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver by any party hereto of any
right to specific performance or injunctive relief. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereto hereby waive the
requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with the remedies
described herein. In the event that any Legal Proceeding should be brought in
equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto shall
allege, and each party hereto hereby waives the defense, that there is an
adequate remedy at law. Without limiting the obligations of the Debt Financing
Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter and the rights of Acquirer and Merger
Sub under the Debt Commitment Letter, the Company acknowledges and agrees
that no Debt Financing Source Related Party shall have any Liability or
obligation to the Company (or any of its Affiliates or any of its or their
respective shareholders, partners, members, Employees, agents or
Representatives) in connection with this Agreement or any Transactions if
such Debt Financing Source Related Party breaches or fails to perform (whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) any of its obligations
under the Debt Commitment Letter and the Company (on behalf of itself, its
Affiliates and its and their respective shareholders, partners, members,
Employees, agents and Representatives) hereby waives any rights or claims
against each Debt Financing Source Related Party in connection with this
Agreement and the Debt Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, and the Company (on behalf of itself, its Affiliates and
its and their respective shareholders, partners, members, Employees, agents
and representatives) agrees not to commence (and if commenced agrees to
dismiss or otherwise terminate) any action or proceeding against any Debt
Financing Source Related Party in connection with this Agreement or any
Transaction (including any action or proceeding relating to the Debt
Financing). This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Legal
Proceeding that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out of or by
reason of, this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, performance or
breach (whether willful, intentional, unintentional or otherwise), of this
Agreement, including any representation or warranty made or alleged to have
been made in, in connection with or as an inducement to, this Agreement (each
of such above-described legal, equitable or other theories or sources of
liability, a " _Recourse Theory_ ") may only be made or asserted against (and
are expressly limited to) the Persons that are expressly identified as
the parties hereto in the preamble to and signature pages of this Agreement
and solely in their capacities as such. No Person who is not a party hereto
(including (a) any former, current or future direct or indirect equity holder,
controlling Person, management company, incorporator, member, partner,
manager, director, officer, employee, agent, Affiliate, attorney or
representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to, or direct or
indirect holder of notes issued by (all above-described Persons in this
subclause (a), collectively, " _Affiliated Persons_ "), a party hereto or any
Affiliate of such party, and (b) any Affiliated Persons of such Affiliated
Persons but specifically excluding the parties hereto (the Persons in
subclauses (a) and (b), together with their respective successors, assigns,
heirs, executors or administrators, collectively, but specifically excluding
the parties hereto, " _Non-Parties_ ")) will have any liability whatsoever in
respect of, based upon or arising out of any Recourse Theory. Without limiting
the rights of any party hereto against the other parties hereto as set forth
herein, in no event will any party hereto, any of its Affiliates or any
Person claiming by, through or on behalf of any of them institute any Legal
Proceeding under any Recourse Theory against any Non-Party. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, nothing shall limit (x) any rights
of Acquirer against (i) the Bain Purchasers under the Investment Agreement or
the indenture contemplated thereby or (ii) the Named Employees under each of
the Transaction Documents to which they are a party, or (y) the rights of any
party hereto against any Non-Party arising under or in respect of a separate
agreement binding on such party and Non-Party.

 



71 8.12 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, all acts and transactions pursuant
hereto and all obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without
reference to such states principles of conflicts of law that would refer a
matter to a different jurisdiction;  _provided_ that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, any disputes involving the Debt Financing Source Related Parties
will be governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable laws of
the State of New York without giving regard to conflicts or choice of law
principles that would result in the application of any law other than the law
of the State of New York. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal
courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware, in
respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to herein, and in respect of the
Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any
action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or
thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding
shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or Federal court. The
parties hereto hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over
the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and
agree that delivering of process or other papers in connection with any such
action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 8.2_ or in such other
manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto agree that it will not bring, or support
the bringing of, any Legal Proceeding, action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise, against the
Debt Financing Source Related Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or
any of the Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in
any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum
other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or,
if under Applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal
courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
in the County of New York (and appellate courts thereof).

 

8.13 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Schedule
and each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any Applicable Law or
rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document. The parties hereto intend that each representation, warranty, and
covenant contained herein shall have independent significance (i.e., if any
