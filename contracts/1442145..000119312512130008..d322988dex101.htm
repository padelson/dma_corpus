Consideration") payable for such Warrant minus (ii) the sum of (A) an amount
equal to the product obtained by multiplying the Escrow Deposit Per Share by
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrant
and (B) any Taxes required to be withheld in connection with such payment. The
aggregate amount payable at Closing to the Company Stockholders, Company
Optionholders and Company Warrantholders as aforesaid is hereinafter referred
to as the "Aggregate Merger Consideration Closing Payment". All such Warrants,
when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and terminated and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
Warrant shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right,
subject to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement, to receive the Warrant
Consideration in accordance with this Article II.

 



15 Section 2.10 _Adjustments._ The Per Share Merger Consideration,
Option Consideration and Warrant Consideration, and all amounts payable as
hereinafter set forth in this Article II, shall be adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of any recapitalization, reorganization, cash or
stock dividend, forward or reverse stock split or other like change with
respect to the Company Common Stock occurring prior to the Effective Time (it
being acknowledged and agreed that the right of the Company to effect any of
the foregoing shall be subject to the provisions hereinafter set forth).

Section 2.11 _Exchange Procedures._

 

(a) (i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have sent the
Information Statement, a letter of transmittal in customary form and the
other Securityholder Documentation to each Securityholder advising such
holders of the terms of the exchange effected by the Merger and the procedure
for surrendering to the Parent such holders certificate(s) evidencing Company
Common Stock for exchange for the Common Stock Closing Payment to which it is
entitled and/or such holders certificate(s) or agreement(s) evidencing
Options or Warrants, for exchange for the Option Closing Payment or Warrant
Closing Payment, as applicable, to which such holder is entitled. In addition
to the foregoing, the Company also shall deliver to each holder of an Option a
notice describing the procedure for exercising such Option and the time period
in which such Option must be exercised if such holder plans to exercise any
Options prior to the Effective Time and a description of the Exchange Program
and cashless exercise program (as each such term is defined and used in the
Company Stock Plan) implemented by the Company. 

(ii) After the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate theretofore
evidencing shares of Company Common Stock, upon surrender of the same to the
Parent in accordance with such letter of transmittal and receipt by the Parent
of the other duly completed and validly executed and delivered Securityholder
Documentation, shall be entitled to receive, in exchange for such
certificate, an amount equal to (i) the Common Stock Closing Payment
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such certificate (such amount to be mailed or delivered by wire transfer of
funds to an account designated in writing by the Company Stockholder within
five (5) days of receipt of the duly completed and validly executed and
delivered Securityholder Documentation; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration payable to a Company
Stockholder as a result of the exercise of an Option for which the required
withholding has not been made, shall be deposited with the Companys payroll
processor as set forth in paragraph (vi) below), and the certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

(iii) Each holder of an agreement theretofore evidencing an Option, upon
surrender of an original or copy of the same to the Parent in accordance with
such letter of transmittal and receipt by the Parent of the other duly
completed and validly executed and delivered Securityholder Documentation,
shall be entitled to receive, in exchange for such Option, an amount in cash
equal to the Option Closing Payment for such Option (such amount to be paid
through the Companys payroll processor as set forth below) and the agreement
so surrendered shall be acknowledged as canceled.

 



16 (iv) Each holder of a certificate or an agreement thereto evidencing
a Warrant, upon surrender of an original or, in the case of an agreement, an
original or a copy of, such certificate or agreement to the Parent in
accordance with such letter of transmittal and receipt by the Parent of the
duly completed and validly executed and delivered Securityholder
Documentation, shall be entitled to receive, in exchange for such certificate
or agreement, an amount equal to the Warrant Closing Payment for such Warrant
(such amount to be mailed or delivered by wire transfer of funds to an
account designated in writing by the Company Warrantholder within five (5)
days of receipt of the duly completed and validly executed and delivered
Securityholder Documentation) and the certificate or agreement so
surrendered shall be acknowledged as canceled.

(v) With respect to any payments pursuant to this Agreement to any
Company Optionholder or to any Company Stockholder in exchange for shares of
Company Common Stock that were issued as a result of the exercise of an Option
in connection with this Agreement for which the required withholding has not
been made (other than payments from the Escrow Amount), at Closing the Parent
shall cause the amount payable to the Company Optionholders and to the
foregoing Company Stockholders, who have delivered their properly completed
and validly executed Securityholders Documentation to the Parent by Closing,
(including the amount of Taxes to be withheld in connection with such payment
but net of the amount to be deposited in the Escrow Amount at Closing) to be
deposited with the Companys payroll processor to be subsequently paid by
such payroll processor to the Company Optionholders and such Company
Stockholders. The Company shall have arranged with its payroll processor prior
to Closing for the distribution of such applicable net amounts payable
(net of Taxes to be withheld) to each Company Optionholder and the foregoing
Company Stockholders through a special payroll to be effected as soon as
practicable but in no event later than two (2) business days after the
Closing, provided that if such special payroll cannot be processed, the
Parent shall cause such payroll processor to make such payments as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than by the Companys next regularly
scheduled payroll, in any such case, consistent with past practices,
including accounting for all applicable withholding. The Company shall have
instructed and shall cause the payroll processor to withhold and remit any
Taxes to the appropriate Governmental Bodies. A similar procedure shall
be implemented with respect to payments to be made to any such Company
Stockholder or Company Optionholder who delivers its properly completed and
validly executed Securityholders Documentation to the Parent after the
Closing.

 

(b) If any payment for shares of Company Common Stock is to be made to a
Person other than the person in whose name such certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of such payment that the certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
payment amount of any stock transfer or similar Taxes (whether imposed on
the registered holder, transferee or otherwise) payable on account of the
transfer to such Person shall be deducted from the amount paid by the Parent,
or otherwise paid in full to the Parent, or the Parent may refuse to make
payment of any portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration unless
satisfactory evidence of any exemption from such Taxes is submitted.

(c) In the event any certificate or stock option agreement, as applicable,
representing any shares of Company Common Stock, or any Option or Warrant,
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in
form and substance reasonably 

 



17  satisfactory to the Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Parent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or agreement, as the
case may be, the amount of the applicable closing payment for each share
represented thereby payable in exchange therefor pursuant to Sections 2.7, 2.8
and 2.9, as applicable. The Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of any such lost, stolen or destroyed share certificate or agreement to
give the Parent or Surviving Corporation a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may reasonably be made
against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

Section 2.12 _Company Stock Transfer Ledger_. At the Effective Time, it shall
be deemed that the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, and no
transfer of Company Common Stock on the books of the Company shall thereafter
be made or consummated. Until surrendered and exchanged in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.11, the outstanding certificates evidencing shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and
after the Effective Time, be deemed for all purposes to evidence the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company
Common Stock theretofore evidenced by such certificate or certificates shall
have been so converted, as though such surrender and exchange had taken place.
Until surrendered and exchanged in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.11, each outstanding agreement or certificate representing an Option or
Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be deemed for all purposes to evidence the right to receive
the Option Consideration or Warrant Consideration into which the Option or
Warrant theretofore evidenced by such certificate or agreement shall have been
converted, as though such surrender and exchange had taken place. If, after
the Effective Time, certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
or agreements or certificates, representing Options or Warrants, are presented
to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

Section 2.13 _Escrow_. At the Closing, the Parent shall cause Seventeen
Million Dollars ($17,000,000) (the "Escrow Amount") of the Merger
Consideration to be deposited with Wells Fargo, N.A., as escrow agent (the
"Escrow Agent"), to be held in escrow, in accordance with the provisions of an
agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_
attached hereto which the Securityholders Representative, on behalf of itself
and each of the Securityholders, and the Parent shall execute and deliver at
the Closing. The Escrow Amount shall constitute security for the indemnity
set forth in Article XI and any Working Capital Deficiency, and the Escrow
Amount shall be held in escrow and distributed in accordance with the
provisions of the Escrow Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the
"Escrow Deposit Per Share" shall mean the quotient obtained by dividing the
amount calculated under the first sentence of this Section 2.13 by the Company
Common Stock Equivalents.

 

Section 2.14 _Third Party Closing Payments_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, at Closing, the Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, or prior
to the Closing the Company shall, make the following payments:

(i) to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement;

 



18 (ii) on behalf of the Company, as applicable, to the holders of
Company Indebtedness, the amounts set forth on the Company Indebtedness
Statement and in the corresponding pay-off letters in accordance with the
instructions provided by such holders of Company Indebtedness;

 

(iii) on behalf of the Company, as applicable, to the Persons entitled to be
paid any Transaction Fees, the amounts set forth on the Transaction Fees
Statement in accordance with the instructions set forth thereon; and

(iv) on behalf of the Company, to the holders of Phantom Options immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the amounts set forth on the Allocation Schedule
in accordance with the instructions set forth therein.

 

Section 2.15 _Allocation Schedule_.

(a) No later than five (5) days prior to the Closing, the Company shall
prepare and submit to the Parent and Merger Sub a schedule (the "Allocation
Schedule") (subject to updating prior to the Closing as provided in Section
2.15(b)) of:

(i) the Aggregate Phantom Option Payment, together with the Persons entitled
to a portion of such payment and the amount allocated to each such Person;

 

(ii) (A) the identity of each holder of shares of Company Common Stock and the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by each such holder thereof
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) the identity of each holder
of an Option or Warrant and the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Option and Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the exercise price and vesting schedule thereof, and the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to each such Option and Warrant that will be
exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

 

(iii) the Companys calculation of (A) the Pro Rata Share for each
Securityholder; (B) the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration Closing
Payment payable to each Securityholder; (C) the total indebtedness, if any,
owed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by each Securityholder; and (D)
any required Tax or other withholding with respect to each Securityholder;

which Allocation Schedule, when accepted by the Parent (such acceptance not to
be unreasonably withheld), shall be deemed to be the definitive calculation
of the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration Closing Payment
applicable to each Securityholder, the Aggregate Phantom Option Payment and
the portion of the Aggregate Phantom Option Payment allocated to each holder
of a Phantom Option. The Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to rely on the Allocation Schedule in connection with the payment of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration Closing Payment and the Aggregate Phantom
Option Payment; _provided_ , that, neither the Parent, nor Merger Sub, nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for any inaccuracies in the
Allocation Schedule.

 

(b) Concurrently with the delivery of the Allocation Schedule to the Parent
and Merger Sub, the Company also shall deliver to the Parent, in such detail
as shall be

 



19  reasonably acceptable to the Parent, all information on which the
calculations set forth on the Allocation Schedule are based. If there are any
changes between the date of delivery of the Allocation Schedule to the Parent
and Merger Sub and the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver an updated
Allocation Schedule to the Parent and Merger Sub setting forth the changes and
any details relating thereto. When delivered to the Parent by the Company at
the Closing, the Allocation Schedule shall be true and correct.

(c) Any adjustments to the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 12.3
hereof for any Working Capital Adjustment shall be paid to the Securityholders
or the Parent, as applicable, pursuant to Section 12.3.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
none of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be
liable for any amount paid to a public official in compliance with any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement.

Section 2.16 _Withholding_. Each of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement (i) such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provisions of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Legal
Requirement, including, without limitation, any required tax withholding
arising from the exercise, cashless or otherwise, of any Option or Warrant
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the amount of any outstanding loans
(including any accrued but unpaid interest thereon any other amounts in
respect thereof) owed by such Person to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing. If the Parent or Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, so withholds any such amounts, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect
of which the Parent or Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding; _provided_ , that the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall remit to the appropriate Governmental
Body amounts withheld under clause (i) in the immediately preceding sentence.
With respect to clause (ii) in the immediately preceding sentence, to the
extent such amounts withheld for such loans are less than the amount of the
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration Closing Payment payable to such
Securityholder, such withheld amount shall be deemed to satisfy and discharge
the respective loans owed by such holder to the Company or its Subsidiary,
as the case may be.

Section 2.17 _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, any Appraisal Share shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration provided for in Section 2.7, but
shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may
be determined to be due with respect to any such Appraisal Shares pursuant to
the DGCL. Each holder of Appraisal Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of
the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall receive
payment therefor in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL. After the
Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such shares as described in the
immediately preceding sentence. If, after the Effective Time, any Appraisal
Shares shall lose their status as Appraisal Shares, then any such shares
shall immediately be converted into the right to receive the applicable cash
payable pursuant to Section 2.7 in respect of such shares as if such shares
never

 



20  had been Appraisal Shares, and the Parent shall issue and deliver to the
holder thereof, following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set
forth in Section 2.11, the amount of cash to which such holder would be
entitled in respect thereof under Section 2.7 and Section 2.11 as if such
shares never had been Appraisal Shares. The Company shall give the Parent and
Securityholders Representative prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company.

Section 2.18 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action._ Without limiting
any other obligation contained in this Agreement, the Company, the Parent and
Merger Sub, respectively, shall take all such lawful action as may be
necessary or appropriate, and coordinate with each other, in order to
effectuate the Merger, the filing of the Certificate of Merger and the
additional transactions contemplated by this Agreement at Closing and at the
Effective Time. In case at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the Surviving Company with full title to all assets, rights,
privileges, powers, immunities, purposes and franchises of each of the Merger
Constituent Companies, the officers and directors of such corporation shall
take all such lawful and necessary action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and
for the avoidance of doubt, consummation of the Merger shall be subject to
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the obligations of the Company,
the Parent and Merger Sub set forth in, respectively, Articles VIII and IX
hereof in the manner set forth therein.

 

ARTICLE III

Subject to the exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Company

failure to so qualify would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. _Section
3.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate list
of all jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware in which it is qualified
to do business. The copies of the Organizational Documents of the Company
which have been delivered by the Company to the Parent are complete and

of any provisions of its Organizational Documents.

 



21 Section 3.2 _Authority._ The execution and delivery by the Company of

Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the additional Company Closing Documents, nor the performance
by the Company of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, will,
directly or indirectly, (with or without notice or lapse of time) conflict
with or violate any provisions of the Organizational Documents of the Company
or any Subsidiary thereof, or any Legal Requirement or Order, or conflict with

connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of, or performance
of its obligations under, this Agreement and the additional Company Closing
Documents, or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby or for any Applicable Contract required to be disclosed in

issued and outstanding. There are no other classes or series of capital stock
of the Company authorized or issued, and no shares issued or outstanding other

Schedule set forth a complete and accurate list of the record and beneficial
owners and holders of the capital stock of the Company with the number of
shares of Company Common Stock set forth opposite such holders name. Except
for 3,800,870 shares of Company Common Stock, no other shares of Company

any party. The treatment of Options in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.8 and 6.9 is consistent with the stock option agreements evidencing
Options and the Company Stock Plan and does not require consent of any of the
holders of the Company Options.

of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation and has the full power
and authority to own or hold under lease the assets and properties which it

Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each other jurisdiction wherein it is required to be so qualified

would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

commitments by or agreements to which the Company or any Subsidiary is bound
relating to the issuance, purchase, assignment or conveyance of any shares of
capital stock or the proprietary interest of any Subsidiary of the Company.
The copies of the Organizational Documents of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries, which have been made available to the Parent by the Company,
are complete and correct.

Section 3.6 _Financial Statements._

 

(a) The Company has made available to the Parent: (i) the consolidated balance
sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2009, 2010 and
2011, respectively, and the related statements of income, stockholders equity

sheets constituting a part of the Historical Financial Statements fully and
fairly present all liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries of the
types normally reflected in balance sheets as and at the respective dates
thereof. All adjustments necessary to present fully and fairly the financial
position and results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
the changes in its cash flows for such periods have been included in the

the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets
at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries maintains internal
control over financial reporting that the Company reasonably believes
provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP.

(i) There have been no formal internal investigations regarding financial
reporting or accounting policies and practices discussed with, reviewed by or
initiated at the direction of the chief executive officer, chief financial
officer (or equivalent thereof), senior vice president of finance, or general
counsel of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, the Board of Directors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any committee thereof. Neither the
Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their independent auditors
have identified (x) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the
system of internal accounting controls utilized by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the
management or other employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who
have a role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal

any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

(d) (i)  _Section 3.6(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a list

damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other
security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 6.5 and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth above by any Representative of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.5 by the
Company.

required at Closing to fully satisfy and discharge any and all Company
Indebtedness, including but not limited to any and all liabilities and
obligations consisting of term and revolver loans, construction and equipment
loans and costs and amounts owed to Affiliates of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Not later than five (5) days prior to Closing, the Company shall
prepare and deliver to the Parent and Merger Sub a statement of the Company

updated Company Indebtedness Statement to the Parent and Merger Sub setting
forth the changes and any details relating thereto. The Company shall afford

and every Securityholder to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries calculated
as and at Closing. If there are any changes between the date of the delivery
of the Securityholder Indebtedness Statement to the Parent and Merger Sub and

Indebtedness Statement to the Parent and Merger Sub setting forth the changes
and any details

 



56  relating thereto. The Company shall afford the Parent and Merger Sub the
opportunity to receive and review any information and any calculation relating

adopted, approved and implemented a cashless exercise program pursuant to the
terms of the Company Stock Plan and (iii) validly terminated and canceled any

Effective Time, all other outstanding Options, Warrants and any other rights
to purchase or convert into any capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and Phantom Options, whether vested or unvested, shall have been
validly canceled, exercised or converted.

Section 6.10 _280G Consent_. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain shareholder approval of any payments or benefits
that could be considered parachute payments for purposes of Section 280G of
the Code such that, if such approval is obtained, such payments and benefits

Section 6.11  _Benefit Arrangements_. (a) The Company shall terminate the
Companys 401(k) plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan") prior to the Closing by duly
adopted resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company required to
effect such termination. Prior to the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of
the Company shall adopt a resolution whereby the Company amends the Company
401(k) Plan, and such plans loan policy, to provide that (i) distributions
shall be made from the Company 401(k) Plan to all participants and
beneficiaries with accounts in the Company 401(k) Plan as soon as possible
following the Closing, with such distributions being made in accordance with
the terms of the Company 401(k) Plan and applicable Legal Requirements and
the tax requirements and qualifications of the Code, (ii) each employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who will continue as an employee of the
Company post-Closing (a "Continuing Employee") having an account in the
Company 401(k) Plan shall be permitted to elect a direct rollover of such
employees entire account under the Company 401(k) Plan including any note
evidencing a loan to such employee from such employees account in the
Company 401(k) Plan, and (iii) any plan loan of a Continuing Employee who
elects a direct rollover of his or her account to the Company 401(k) Plan
shall not become due and payable in full immediately as a result of a
distribution of such employees account under the Company 401(k) Plan. The
Company shall continue to administer the loan policy under the Company 401(k)
Plan in such a manner that a default of a Continuing Employees loan from
such employees account under the Company 401(k) Plan shall not occur until
the last day of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which
an employee fails to make a payment required under a note issued in
connection with any outstanding plan loan.

 



57 (b) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Parent, or an Affiliate of the
Parent, shall cause the ISO 401(k) Savings and Employee Stock Ownership Plan
of ISO (the "ISO 401(k) Plan") to accept qualified direct rollovers of
accounts of the Continuing Employees under the Company 401(k) Plan, including
any notes evidencing loans to Continuing Employees from their account balance
in the Company 401(k) Plan and all qualified domestic relations orders, within
the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the obligation of the ISO 401(k) Plan to accept a direct rollover of account
balances consisting of loans shall be limited as follows: (i) only loans to
participants who elect to rollover their entire account balances are required
to be accepted, and (ii) the ISO 401(k) Plan may impose such reasonable
procedural requirements as the Parent deems reasonably necessary or
appropriate to facilitate the rollovers (including requiring that such
rollovers take place during a specified time period). To the extent permitted
by applicable Legal Requirements and the tax qualification requirements under
the Code, and further, subject to any applicable break in service or similar
rule under the Code, the Parent, or an Affiliate of Parent, shall recognize
each Continuing Employees service with the Company prior to the Closing Date,
as service with the Parent, or an Affiliate of Parent, for purposes of
determining eligibility in and vesting under the ISO 401(k) Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no prior service shall be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits, and in
no event shall any Continuing Employee be eligible to participate in any
feature of the ISO 401(k) Plan that may consist of an employee stock ownership
plan.

(c) In addition, and without limiting the foregoing, from and after the
Closing Date and for a period of one (1) year from the Closing Date, the
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate of the
Parent to, provide to each Continuing Employee substantially similar health
and welfare employee benefits as those provided to such Continuing Employees
as of the date of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to the extent permissible by Legal Requirements and under the
applicable health and welfare benefit plans, each Continuing Employees prior
service with the Company will be recognized in connection with all employee
benefit plans under which the Continuing Employees are eligible
to participate, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and levels of benefits,
except to the extent such service credit will result in the duplication of
benefits. With respect to any group health plan maintained by the Company, the
Parent or an Affiliate of the Parent for the benefit of Continuing Employees,
the Parent will (i) to the extent permissible by Legal Requirements and under
the applicable benefit plans, cause there to be waived any eligibility
requirements or pre-existing condition limitations with respect to Continuing
Employees and their dependents, as applicable, and (ii) to the extent
permissible by Legal Requirements and under the applicable benefit plans, for
the plan year that includes the Closing, give effect, in determining any
deductible, co-payment, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations
amounts paid during the plan year that included the Closing by such Continuing
Employees or their dependents, as applicable, with respect to similar Benefit
Plans maintained by the Company.

(d) The Company and the Securityholders Representative acknowledge and agree
that all provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the
Parent and the Company, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, shall create any third-party beneficiary or

 



58  other rights in any other Person, including any current or former employee
of the Company or any or its Subsidiaries, any participant in any Benefit Plan
or any dependent or beneficiary thereof. No provision of this Agreement shall
constitute an amendment to any Benefit Plan or any employee benefit or
compensation plan, policy, agreement or arrangement of Parent or any of its
Affiliates.

 

(e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as: (i) requiring the
Surviving Corporation or the Parent or any of their Affiliates to continue
any particular Benefit Plan, any 409A Plan or other employee compensation or
benefit plan or arrangements or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof whether before or after the Closing; (ii) creating any
right to any compensation whatsoever on the part of any future, present or
former employee of the Surviving Corporation or the Parent or any of their
Affiliates; or (iii) constituting an amendment to any Benefit Plan, any 409A
Plan or other employee benefit or compensation plan or arrangement.

Section 6.12 _Landlord Estoppel Certificates._ The Company shall use its
reasonable commercial efforts to obtain, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Parent and Merger Sub, an estoppel certificate and consent
executed by each of the landlords under each of the real property leases to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

Section 6.13 _Review of Interim Financial Statements_ _._ The Company shall
cause the Companys consolidated Interim Financial Statement for the nine-
month period ended December 31, 2011 to be reviewed by the Companys
accountants and shall deliver a copy of the completed reviewed Interim
Financial Statement to the Parent prior to the Closing.

Section 11.3 _Time Limitations._ Except with respect to Damages resulting or
arising from or based upon (i) fraud, (ii) any breach of the representations
or warranties set forth in Section 3.13 (Tax Matters) or (iii) any matter set
forth in Section 11.2(f), the Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled
to indemnification or to be held harmless under Section 11.2 unless on or
before March 30, 2013 the Parent notifies the Securityholders Representative
in writing of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable
detail to the extent then known by the Parent Indemnified Parties. A claim
for Damages resulting or arising from or based upon fraud may be made at any
time during the applicable statute of limitations as the same may be extended
or waived and a claim for Damages resulting or arising from or in connection
with or based upon a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.13 or any matter set forth in Section 11.2(f) may be made at any
time before or on December 31, 2014, other than any such representations or
warranties fraudulently made (which shall not be subject to the foregoing
limitation survival).

 

Section 11.4 _Limitations on Amount_.

(a) Except with respect to claims resulting or arising from or based upon
fraud, the Parent Indemnified Persons shall not have any right to
indemnification or to be held harmless under Section 11.2(a) for the breach
of any of the Companys representations and warranties, except for breaches of
any of the representations or warranties in Sections 3.1 (Organization and
Good Standing), 3.2 (Authority), 3.3 (No Conflict), 3.4 (Capitalization), 3.5
(Subsidiaries), 3.13 (Tax Matters), 3.15 (Employee Benefits), 3.17 (Legal
Proceedings; Orders), 3.24 (Intellectual Property), 3.25 (Certain Payments) or
3.32 (HIPAA/HITECH Compliance) (collectively, the
"Fundamental Representations"), until the aggregate of all Damages exceeds
$250,000 (the "Deductible Amount"), in which event the Securityholders shall
be responsible for and the Parent Indemnified Persons shall be indemnified for
all Damages in excess of such amount. Any claim for indemnification for the
breach by the Company of any of the Fundamental Representations or any claim
for indemnification based upon any of Sections 11.2(b) through and including
11.2(m) and any of the matters set forth therein may be made regardless of
whether the amount of Damages exceeds or is less than the Deductible Amount
and the Securityholders shall be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless the
Parent Indemnified Persons for, the entire amount of such Damages up to the
aggregate limit set forth in this Section 11.4. A claim for Damages resulting
or arising or based upon fraud may be made regardless of whether the amount of
Damages exceeds or is less than the Deductible Amount and Securityholders
shall be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified
Person for the entire amount of such Damages.

 



68 (b) Except with respect to claims resulting or arising from or based upon
fraud, the Parent Indemnified Persons shall not have any right to
indemnification or to be held harmless under this Agreement except from
amounts available in the Escrow Fund.

(c) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification or other payment is
provided under this Article XI shall be net of any amounts actually recovered
by the Parent Indemnified Persons under insurance policies with respect to
such Damages arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages. Any
indemnity or hold harmless payment hereunder shall be treated as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes unless there is no reasonable basis
for doing so under the relevant Tax law.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
that any party shall have any obligation to indemnify or hold harmless any
other Person under this Agreement, such obligation shall not include any
obligation to indemnify for any consequential, special or punitive damages
whatsoever, even if advised of the possibility of such damages other than
consequential, special or punitive damages awarded to an unrelated third-
party.

(e) The Parent Indemnified Persons shall make commercially reasonably efforts
to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability for which indemnification may be
sought pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

(f) In no event shall any Parent Indemnified Person be entitled to a duplicate
indemnification, payment, reimbursement, adjustment or other remedy or
recovery from the Securityholders in respect of any Damages.

Section 11.5 _Procedure For Indemnification._

(a) A Parent Indemnified Person shall promptly notify the Securityholders
Representative of any claim, demand, action or proceeding for which
indemnification or being held harmless may be sought under Section 11.2, and,
if such claim, demand, action or proceeding by or on behalf of any Person
other than a party to this Agreement or its successors or assigns would
result in Damages (a "Third Party Claim"). Any omission so to notify the
Securityholders Representative as aforesaid shall not relieve any party from
any liability they may have to any Parent Indemnified Person to the extent
that such party is not prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) If the Parent gives notice to the Securityholders Representative of the
commencement of such Third Party Claim, the Securityholders Representative
shall have the right, at its sole expense to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Indemnified
Persons shall have the right in all respects to control the defense with
respect to such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , except as set
forth below, the Securityholders Representative, at its sole cost and
expense, may assume and manage the defense of such Third Party Claim, with
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Parent, if such Third Party Claim seeks
only monetary damages and the potential aggregate Damages arising from such
Third Party Claim, when taken together with all other outstanding claims for
indemnification by the Parent Indemnified Persons, would not reasonably be
expected to exceed the amount of Escrow Fund then held in the Escrow
Fund ("Permissible Third Party Claim").

 



69  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in no event shall the
Securityholders Representative have the right to assume or manage the defense
of any Third Party Claim (i) or matter that involves or is related to Taxes,
(ii) to which the Securityholders Representative or any Securityholder is
also a party to such Third Party Claim and the Parent determines in good faith
that joint representation would be inappropriate, (iii) if the potential
aggregate Damages arising from such Third Party Claim, when taken together
with all other outstanding claims for indemnification by the Parent
Indemnified Persons, could reasonably be expected to exceed the amount of
Escrow Fund then held by the Escrow Agent, (iv) if the Third Party Claim seeks
relief other than monetary damages, (v) if the subject matter of the Third
Party Claim relates to the ongoing business of the Surviving Corporation, any
of its Subsidiaries, or any of the Parent Indemnified Persons and, if decided
against the Surviving Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Parent Indemnified Persons, would adversely affect the ongoing business or
reputation of the Surviving Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
the Parent Indemnified Persons, or (vi) if the Securityholders Representative
does not or is not diligently defending against such Third Party Claim. If the
Securityholders Representative assumes the defense of a Permissible Third
Party Claim (i) it will be conclusively established for purposes of this
Agreement that the claims made in such Permissible Third Party Claim are
within the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no compromise or
settlement of such claims may be effected by the Securityholders
Representative without the Parents consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (iii) the Parent Indemnified Persons
will have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such
claims effected without its consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If notice is given to the
Securityholders Representative of the commencement of any Permissible Third
Party Claim and the Securityholders Representative does not, within twenty
(20) days (or, if earlier, by the tenth day preceding the day on which an
answer or other pleading must be served in order to prevent judgment by
default in favor of the Person asserting the claim) after the Parent
Indemnified Persons notice is given, give notice to the Parent of its
election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Securityholders
and the Securityholders Representative will be bound by any determination
made in such Third Party Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the
Parent Indemnified Persons. In the event that the Securityholders
Representative assumes and manages any Permissible Third Party Claim, the
Parent Indemnified Persons shall have the right to participate in the defense
thereof at its sole cost and expense, using counsel reasonably
satisfactory to it and, if the Securityholders Representative does not
diligently conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Parent
Indemnified Persons shall, upon written notice to the Securityholders
Representative, have the right to assume control thereof.

(c) A claim for indemnification or to be held harmless shall specify the
amount, or good faith estimate thereof, and nature of such claimed Damages
and include the request of the Parent Indemnified Persons for indemnification
of such amount. Upon receipt by the Securityholders Representative of such
written notice, the Securityholders Representative shall have twenty (20)
days (or, if earlier, by the tenth day preceding the day on which an answer or
other pleading must be served in order to prevent judgment by default in favor
of the Person asserting the claim) to review such notice and state whether he
has any objections to the matters stated therein. If the Securityholders
Representative has not objected in writing to any claim or claims made in such
notice within twenty (20) days (or, if earlier, by the tenth day preceding
the day on which an answer or other pleading must be served in order to
prevent judgment by default in favor of the Person asserting the claim) of
receipt of such notice, the amount of such Damages shall thereupon
become payable to such Parent Indemnified Persons from the Escrow Fund.

 



70 (d) In connection with any such Third Party Claim, the Securityholders
Representative and the Parent Indemnified Persons shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, cooperate with each other and provide each
other with reasonable access to relevant books and records in their
possession.

 

Section 11.6 _Subrogation._ To the extent that any Parent Indemnified Person
has been indemnified and held harmless by the Securityholders pursuant to
this Article XI, the Securityholders Representative shall be entitled to
exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including
rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of recovery)
that the Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Person may have against any
other third person with respect to any Damages, circumstances or matter to
which such indemnification is directly or indirectly related. Such Parent
Indemnified Persons shall cooperate with the Securityholders Representative
in a reasonable manner, and at the cost of the Securityholders
Representative, in presenting any subrogated right, defense or claim.

 

Section 11.7 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy; Management of Claims._ Except with
respect to claims resulting or arising from or based upon fraud, a request
for injunctive relief or specific performance or in connection with a dispute
under Section 12.2(b) (which shall be governed by Section 12.2(b)), from and
after the Closing the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent and all other
Parent Indemnified Persons with respect to any and all claims under or
relating to this Agreement, including without limitation under the Company
Disclosure Schedule and any Statements or secretaries or
officers certificates (other than the Non-Competition Agreements), delivered
by the Company pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (other than the enforcement of a
Securityholder Release), shall be to be indemnified or held harmless pursuant
to the provisions set forth in Section 11.2 solely from amounts then available
in the Escrow Fund. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Parent and
Merger Sub hereby waives, and agrees to cause its Affiliates and all other
Parent Indemnified Persons to waive, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action, except for claims or causes of action for fraud, injunctive relief or
specific performance, they may have against any other party hereto or any
Affiliate thereof arising under or based upon any statutory or common law or
otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification and hold harmless provisions
set forth in this Article XI) to the extent relating to this
Agreement, including without limitation under the Company Disclosure Schedule
or any Statements delivered by the Company pursuant to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (other than the Non-Competition
Agreements and Securityholder Releases). All claims for indemnity or to be
held harmless made by any Parent Indemnified Person shall be raised and
managed solely by and through the Parent.

ARTICLE XII

Section 12.1 _Pro Forma Working Capital Statement._

 

(a) No later than four (4) business days prior to Closing, the Company shall
prepare, based upon its good faith estimates and assumptions and in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied and using the same practices,
principles and methodologies used in preparing the Audited Financial
Statements, a statement setting forth the calculation of the 

 



71  estimated amount ("Estimated Working Capital") at Closing for the Company
and its Subsidiaries obtained by subtracting: (i) the amount of the current
liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including, without
limitation, the employer portion of all employment Taxes resulting from or
relating to the payment of any compensation arising from or related to any
periods prior to Closing including, without limitation, any bonus or any
payments in respect of any Options, Phantom Options or restricted stock, from
(ii) the amount of the current assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
excluding any income Tax assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; it
being acknowledged that, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, none of the following items shall be included in the calculation of
the Estimated Working Capital: (A) any amount outstanding from the Company to
any Affiliate of the Company, or from any Affiliate of the Company to the
Company; (B) Company Indebtedness; (C) Transaction Fees; or (D) the Aggregate
Phantom Option Payment, all of which items in clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D)
shall be paid and discharged prior to or at Closing; (E) the Companys unpaid
estimated tax payment otherwise due March 15, 2012 or (F) any FIN 48 current
reserves. The foregoing statement shall, consistent with this Agreement, be
reasonably acceptable to the Parent and is referred to herein as the "Pro
Forma Working Capital Statement".

(b) If Estimated Working Capital is greater than the Baseline Working Capital,
the amount by which Estimated Working Capital exceeds Baseline Working Capital
shall be referred to herein as the "Estimated Working Capital Surplus". If
Estimated Working Capital is less than Baseline Working Capital, the amount by
which the Baseline Working Capital exceeds Estimated Working Capital shall be
referred to herein as the "Estimated Working Capital Deficiency". The amount
of the Estimated Working Capital Surplus, if any, or Estimated Working Capital
Deficiency, if any, shall be used to calculate the Aggregate Merger
Consideration Closing Payment, Common Stock Closing Payment, Option Closing
Payment and Warrant Closing Payment. The Company shall afford the Parent the
opportunity to receive and review any information and any calculation relating
to the preparation of the Pro Forma Working Capital Statement.

 



72 Section 12.2 _Closing Working Capital Statement._

 

(a) Within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, the Parent shall
prepare, in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and using the same
practices, principles and methodologies used in preparing the Audited
Financial Statements, and shall deliver to the Securityholders
Representative, a statement setting forth the calculation of the amount
("Closing Working Capital") at Closing obtained by subtracting: (i) the
amount of the current liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including, without limitation, the employer portion of all employment Taxes
resulting from or related to the payment of any ordinary payroll compensation
arising from or related to any periods prior to Closing, including, without
limitation, any bonus or any payments in respect of any Options, Phantom
Options or restricted stock, from (ii) the amount of the current assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, excluding any income Tax assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; it being acknowledged that,
notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, none of the
following items shall be included in calculating the Closing Working Capital:
(A) any amount outstanding from the Company to any Affiliate of the Company,
or from any Affiliate of the Company to the Company; (B) Company
Indebtedness; (C) Transaction Fees; or (D) the Aggregate Phantom Option
Payment, all of which items in clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D) shall be paid and
discharged prior to or at Closing; (E) the Companys unpaid estimated tax
payment otherwise due March 15, 2012 or (F) any FIN 48 current reserves.

(b) Within thirty (30) days after its receipt of such statement, the
Securityholders Representative shall examine such statement, and any
determinations, computations, and decisions made in the preparation thereof.
In the event the Securityholders Representative shall disagree with any of
the determinations, computations or decisions relating to the preparation of
such statement, the Securityholders Representative shall, within thirty (30)
days after its receipt of such statement, serve notice of such disputed
item or items upon the Parent, and the Securityholders Representative and
the Parent shall thereupon endeavor to reach agreement with respect thereto.
Any failure by the Securityholders Representative to deliver such notice
within such period with respect to such statement shall be deemed conclusive
acceptance by the Securityholders Representative and the Company Stockholders
of such statement. If such agreement with respect to any item identified in a
notice as aforesaid shall not be reached within fifteen (15) days of the date
of such notice of disagreement, such disputed item or items shall be submitted
for determination to a firm of independent public accountants reasonably
acceptable to both the Securityholders Representative and the Parent (which
shall not be the Accountant or any accounting firm retained on a regular basis
by the Parent, or any Affiliate of the Parent, or the Securityholders
Representative, or any Affiliate of the Securityholders Representative), the
cost of which shall be borne equally by the Securityholders Representative
and the Parent. The determination of such independent public accountants shall
be made within forty-five (45) days of its selection and shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. The foregoing statement,
completed as aforesaid, is referred to herein as the "Closing Working Capital
Statement". If Closing Working Capital is greater than Estimated Working
Capital, the amount by which Closing Working Capital exceeds Estimated Working
Capital shall be referred to herein as the "Working Capital Surplus". If
Closing Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital, the
amount by which Estimated Working Capital exceeds Closing Working Capital
shall be referred to herein as the "Working Capital Deficiency".

 



73 Section 12.3 _Merger Consideration Adjustments._

 

(a) Within ten (10) days after the determination under Section 12.2 of all
disputed items contained in the Closing Working Capital Statement and the
calculation of the Working Capital Deficiency (if any) or Working Capital
Surplus (if any) or within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, whichever
is later, the parties shall recalculate the Merger Consideration as shall be
required to adjust any closing payments made pursuant to Sections 2.7, 2.8 and
2.9 for any Working Capital Surplus or any Working Capital Deficiency, as the
case may be (the "Working Capital Adjustment"), so that 

(i) in the case of any Working Capital Surplus, the amount of the Working
Capital Surplus shall be paid by the Parent to the Company Stockholders (who
have not exercised appraisal rights), the Company Optionholders and Company
Warrantholders, who have delivered to the Parent their duly completed and
validly executed Securityholder Documentation, in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares and the terms of Section 12.3(b) and any amount of
any Working Capital Surplus which would have been paid to a Company
Stockholder if such had not exercised appraisal rights shall be retained
by the Parent, and

(ii) in the case of any Working Capital Deficiency, the amount of such Working
Capital Deficiency shall be paid to the Parent from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with terms of Section 12.3(b).

(b) Except as set forth below, any amount due to the Securityholders under
this Section 12.3 as a result of a Working Capital Surplus shall be paid
within ten (10) days of such recalculation by the Parent to the Company
Stockholders who have not exercised appraisal rights, Company Optionholders
and Company Warrantholders and who have delivered to the Parent their duly
completed and validly executed Securityholder Documentation, at the Parents
election, by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the
accounts designated in writing by such Securityholders. With respect to any
payments due pursuant to this Section 12.3 to any Company Optionholder or to
any Company Stockholder in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock that
were issued as a result of the exercise of an Option in connection with this
Agreement, the Parent shall cause the amount payable to such Company
Optionholders and such Company Stockholders (including the amount of Taxes
to be withheld in connection with such payment) to be deposited with the
Companys payroll processor to be subsequently distributed by such payroll
processor to such Company Optionholders and Company Stockholders. If any
amount is due to the Parent under this Section 12.3 as a result of a Working
Capital Deficiency, such amount shall be paid to the Parent from the Escrow
Amount. The Securityholders Representative agrees that he shall not deliver
any objection notice with respect to a claim made by the Parent under the
Escrow Agreement for any amount due to the Parent under this Section 12.3.

 



74 ARTICLE XIII

(a) The indemnification obligations of the Securityholders with respect to
Taxes are provided in Article XI of this Agreement.

(b) In the case of any Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income, receipts, capital or revenues of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period (as defined in Section 11.2(f))
shall be determined and allocated based on an interim closing of the books as
of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, (i)
deductions in employment and payroll related Taxes, including the withholding
of all income Taxes, FICA and FUTA, and (ii) the Taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or any of its
stockholders holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such
time) and the amount of any other Taxes of the Company, its Subsidiaries and
any of its stockholders for a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

(c) (i) The Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to
be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries that will be
filed after the Closing Date, including, without limitation, the filing or
amendment of any Tax Returns that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. With
respect to any and all Tax Returns that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
and for which Parent may seek indemnification for Taxes pursuant to Article
XI, the Parent shall provide a draft copy of such Tax Returns to the
Securityholders Representative at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
Parents chosen filing date for such Tax Returns and the Parent shall consider
any and all reasonable comments provided by Securityholders Representative
with respect to such Tax Returns, provided that such comments are delivered in
writing by the Securityholders Representative to the Parent no less than
five (5) days prior to the Parents chosen filing date for such Tax Returns;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Parent shall fully control the preparation
and filing of all such Tax Returns and, notwithstanding the
Parents consideration of the Securityholders Representatives comments, the
Parent shall have no obligation to accept or incorporate into any such Tax
Returns any of the Securityholders Representatives comments.

 

(i) The parties hereto shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to Section 13.1(c) (including signing any such Tax Returns) above and
any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon any other partys request)
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Returns, audit, litigation, or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 



75 (ii) The Company and the Securityholders Representative, on behalf of the
Securityholders, agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any Taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Parent or the
Securityholders Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective
Taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements with any
Taxing authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying, or discarding any such books and records
and, if the other party so requests, the Company or the Securityholders
Representative, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take
possession of such books and records.

(iii) The Securityholders Representative, on behalf of the Securityholders.
and the Parent further agree, upon request, to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Body or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce, or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but
not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

(iv) The Securityholders Representative, on behalf of the Securityholders,
and the Parent further agree, upon request, to provide any other party hereto
with all information that any party may be required to report pursuant to
Code Sections 6043 or 6043A and all Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder.

(d) All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving the Company and any of its Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of
the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

(e) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, and other such
Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges, and other fees and charges

Section 14.1 _Appointment of the Securityholders  Representative as
Attorney-In-Fact._

(a) Upon the approval of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders in
accordance with the DGCL and the Organizational Documents of the Company and
the execution of this Agreement by the Company and the Securityholders
Representative, each Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder and
Company Warrantholder, without any further act of such Company Stockholder,
Company Optionholder and Company Warrantholder, hereby consents to and
appoints the Securityholders Representative, including any replacement of
such Securityholders Representative, as such Company Stockholder, Company
Optionholder and Company Warrantholders agent and attorney-in-fact, with full
power and authority in the name of and for and on behalf of such holders, to
serve as the Securityholders Representative under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and to exercise the power and authority granted to or
required by the Securityholders Representative hereunder and thereunder
(including the execution and delivery of the Escrow Agreement on behalf of
each such Securityholder).

(b) The Securityholders Representative is hereby granted the power and
authority by each Securityholder to negotiate and enter into amendments to
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement for himself, herself or itself and on
behalf of such holders, act on the behalf of such Securityholder in any
dispute, litigation or arbitration involving this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or any document delivered to the Securityholders Representative in
such capacity pursuant hereto or thereto and to do or refrain from doing all
such further acts and things, and execute all such documents as the
Securityholders Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, to object to indemnification claims under Article XI, to
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply
with orders of courts and with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts
with respect to, any other claim by any Parent Indemnified Persons against
any Securityholder or by any such Securityholder against any Parent
Indemnified Persons or any dispute between any Parent Indemnified Persons and
any such Securityholder, in each case relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are
either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholders
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically
mandated by the terms of this Agreement. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Securityholders Representative shall constitute a decision
of all of the Securityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive on
each Securityholder, and the Escrow Agent, the Parent and each of their
respective Representatives. All decisions, acts, consents or instructions of
the Securityholders Representative may be relied upon by any third party
as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of every Securityholder
and shall be conclusive and binding upon each Securityholder.

(c) In the event of the death, physical or mental incapacity, or resignation
of the Securityholders Representative or any successor Securityholders
Representative, the 

 



77  Securityholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of Company
Stock (calculated on a fully-diluted and as converted basis) immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including the personal representative of any deceased
or disabled Securityholder in the event of the death or disability of such
holder) shall promptly appoint a substitute Securityholders Representative
and shall notify the Parent and the Escrow Agent of such action.

(d) As between the Securityholders Representative and the Securityholders,
the Securityholders Representative shall not be liable for, and shall be
indemnified by the Securityholders against any good faith error of judgment on
his part or for any other act done or omitted by him in good faith in
connection with his duties as the Securityholders Representative, except for
fraud and willful misconduct. All expenses incurred by the Securityholders
Representative in performing his duties hereunder (including legal fees and
expenses of counsel thereto), and any indemnification to be provided to the
Securityholders Representative ("Securityholders Representative Expenses"),
shall be jointly and severally borne by the Securityholders; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Securityholders Representative shall have the right to,
and shall to the extent available, use up to One Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($150,000) of the Escrow Amount as such expenses are incurred for
reasonably and appropriately documented Securityholders Representative
Expenses and for reserves thereof.

(e) The authority conferred under this Section 14.1 is an agency coupled with
an interest and, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, all
authority conferred hereby is irrevocable and not subject to termination by
the undersigned or by operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of
any of the Securityholders, the termination of any trust or estate, or the
occurrence of any other event. If any Securityholder should die or become
incapacitated, if any trust or estate of any of the above should
be terminated, or if any other event shall occur, any action taken by the
Securityholders Representative pursuant to this Section 14.1 shall be valid
as if such death or incapacity, termination, or other event had not occurred,
regardless of whether or not the Securityholders Representative or the
Parent shall have received notice of such death, incapacity, termination, or
other event.

Section 14.2 _Expenses._ Each of the parties hereto shall bear and pay such
partys own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

14.3, public announcement or any publicity with respect to this Agreement or

written consent of the Parent, except as such release or announcement may be

release or announcement shall allow the other parties reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. Unless
consented to by the Parent in advance, or otherwise required by Legal
Requirements, until publicly disclosed by the Parent pursuant to Legal
Requirements, the Company shall and shall cause the Securityholders and
their respective Representatives to, keep this Agreement strictly
confidential and may not make any disclosure of this Agreement to any Person,
except to their respective Representatives. The Company and the Parent will
consult with each other concerning the means by which the Companys
employees, customers, and suppliers and others having dealings with the
Company will be informed of the transactions contemplated hereby. Between the
date of this Agreement and the Closing, the Parent agrees that it will
consult with the Company prior to contacting any

the Parent may issue a press release or announcement regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Agreement and agree that any information originally furnished by another party
or the Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be treated as "Evaluation Material" as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement, subject to the qualifications in paragraph 2

Section 14.7 _Jurisdiction; Service of Process._ Any action or proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising out of,
this Agreement may be brought against any of the parties in the courts of the
State of New York, or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and each of the
parties consents to and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding and
waives any objection to venue laid therein. Process in any action or
proceeding referred to in the preceding sentence may be served on any party
anywhere in the world.

Section 14.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14.8.

 

Section 14.9 _Governing Law._ This Agreement will be governed by the laws of
the State of New York without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.

 



81 Section 14.10 _Waiver._ The rights and remedies of the parties to
this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor
any delay by any party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this
Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a
waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise
of any such right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further
exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other
right, power, or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the documents
referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in
part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing
signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be
applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no
notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of
any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such notice
or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this
Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

 

Section 14.11 _Entire Agreement and Modification._ This Agreement supersedes
all prior agreements between the parties with respect to its subject matter
(including the Indication of Interest between Verisk Analytics, Inc. and the
Company dated January 23, 2012) and constitutes (along with the documents
referred to in this Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the
terms of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter.
This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by
the Parent, the Company and the Securityholders Representative. 

Section 14.12 _Assignments, Successors, and No Third-Party Rights._ No party
may assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that the Parent may assign any of its
rights under this Agreement to any Affiliate of the Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Parent shall remain primarily responsible for any obligations
to pay the Merger Consideration to the Securityholders in accordance with
Article II hereof and for any other obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects
upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the
parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed
to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or
equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or
any provision of this Agreement, except (i) for the rights of the
Securityholders to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Article
II hereof, as may be adjusted in accordance with Sections 12.2 and 12.3, (ii)
that each Parent Indemnified Person shall be a beneficiary of Article XI, and
(iii) each current or former director or officer of the Company shall be a
beneficiary of Section 7.2. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence,
this Agreement and all of its provisions and conditions are for the sole and
exclusive benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their successors and
assigns.

 

Section 14.13 _Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any
provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or
degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable.

Section 14.14 _Specific Performance_. The Company, the Parent, Merger Sub, and
the Securityholders Representative each recognize that any breach of the
terms of this Agreement

 



82  may give rise to irreparable harm for which money damages would not be an
adequate remedy, and accordingly agree that, in addition to other remedies,
any non-breaching party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance in any
action instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof, or
any other jurisdiction, having jurisdiction without the necessity of proving
the inadequacy as a remedy of money damages.

Section 14.15 _Time Of Essence._ With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

 

Section 14.16 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.

Section 14.17 _Waiver of Conflict._ Each of Parent and Company hereby
acknowledges that Morrison and Foerster LLP has represented the interests of the
Company in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and in order to avoid any conflict of interest that might be
deemed to arise from the Parents acquisition of the Company, the Parent and
the Company each hereby waive any conflict that might preclude Morrison and
Foerster LLP from representing the Securityholders Representative, any
Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or Company Warrantholder, or any of
their respective Affiliates (including the Company), including in connection
with any disputes arising from the Merger, the Escrow Fund, this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement.
