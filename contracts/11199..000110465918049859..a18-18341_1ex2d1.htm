converted into the right to receive 5.1 New Holdco Shares.

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Bemis (the " _Bemis Board of Directors_ ")

updates);

 



 

(e) Amcor shall consult with Bemis as to the content and presentation of the
Scheme Booklet, including (subject to _Section 5.5_):

Bemiss review is to be limited to a review for factual accuracy);

 



 

(ii) providing to Bemis a revised draft of the Scheme Booklet within a
reasonable time before its filing with ASIC and to enable Bemis to review the
draft Scheme Booklet before the date of its filing; and

accordance with paragraph 5 of Exhibit A) apply to the Court for orders
approving the Scheme as agreed to by the Amcor Shareholders at the Scheme
Meeting;

 



 

(i) At the Second Court Hearing, Amcor and New Holdco shall provide to the
Court a certificate confirming whether or not the Conditions (other than the
Condition relating to Court approval in paragraph 1(b) of Exhibit A) have been
satisfied or waived in accordance with paragraph 5 of Exhibit A;

 



 

(j) Amcor and New Holdco shall each procure that it is represented by counsel
at the Court hearing convened for the purposes of section 411(4)(b) of the
Corporations Act;

 



 

(k) Amcor shall lodge with ASIC an office copy of the Court Order in
accordance with subsection 411(10) of the Australian Act approving the Scheme

and Bemis);

 



 

(l) Amcor shall, if the Scheme Closing occurs, finalize and close the Amcor

the Scheme and the Deed Poll;

 



 

(m) New Holdco shall accept the transfer of the Amcor Shares;

New Holdco immediately before the Scheme Implementation, such buy-back,
redemption or cancellation to take effect immediately after the Scheme

Section 1.3 _Responsibilities of Bemis in Respect of the Scheme_. On the terms
set forth in the Scheme and this Agreement, Bemis shall:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) keep Amcor reasonably informed and consult with Amcor as to the
performance of the obligations and responsibilities required of Bemis pursuant
to this Agreement or the Scheme and as to any developments relevant to the
proper implementation of the Scheme;

 



 

(b) afford, in a timely manner, all such cooperation and assistance as may
reasonably be requested by Amcor in respect of the preparation and
verification of any document or in connection with any confirmation required
for the implementation of the Scheme, including the provision to Amcor of such
information and confirmations relating to it, the Bemis Subsidiaries and any
of its or their respective directors, officers or employees as Amcor may
reasonably request (including for the purposes of facilitating the delivery of
the IER and obtaining the ATO Ruling); and

 



 

(c) before the commencement of the Second Court Hearing, provide to Amcor for
provision to the Court at such hearing a certificate in the form of a deed
confirming whether or not, in respect of matters within Bemiss knowledge, the
Conditions (other than the Condition relating to Court approval in paragraph
1(b) of Exhibit A)) have been satisfied or waived in accordance with paragraph
5 of Exhibit A, a draft of which certificate shall be provided by Bemis to
Amcor at least five Business Days prior to the Second Court Hearing.

Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry
Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares
are registered. If any New Holdco Shares are to be delivered to a Person other
than the holder in whose name any Bemis Eligible Shares are registered, it
shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such delivery
shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
transfer of New Holdco Shares to a Person other than the registered holder of
any Bemis Eligible Shares, or shall establish to the satisfaction of New
Holdco and the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

 



 

(d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Bemis Shares_. At the

Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the 12
month anniversary of the Effective Time, New Holdco shall be entitled to

interest received with respect thereto) or New Holdco Shares remaining in the
Exchange Fund that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is
pending subject only to the Exchange Agents routine administrative
procedures, to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation and
New Holdco (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration, including any dividends or other distributions on New Holdco
Shares in accordance with _Section 2.8(g)_ and any Fractional Share
Consideration, payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.8(b)_, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) none of the Surviving
Corporation, New Holdco or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of
a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other
amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law and (ii) any portion of the Merger
Consideration or other cash that remains undistributed to the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of immediately prior to such time that

Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required
by New Holdco or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such holder of a bond in
such amount as New Holdco or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to any such Certificates, the applicable
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7_,
any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions on such New Holdco Shares in accordance with
_Section 2.8(g)_, in each case without any interest thereon.

 



 

(g) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to New Holdco Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to New Holdco Shares with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the New Holdco

instead be paid by New Holdco to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in
the Exchange Fund, in each case, until the surrender of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with
this Agreement. Subject to applicable Law and _Section 2.11_, following
surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest,

the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such New Holdco Shares to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with

(h) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional New Holdco Shares will be exchanged for
any Bemis Shares or Bemis Equity Awards. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, each holder of Bemis Shares or Bemis Equity Awards whose
Bemis Shares or Bemis Equity Awards were validly converted into the right to
receive New Holdco Shares and who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a New Holdco Share (after aggregating all Bemis Shares
represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder
and aggregating all Bemis Equity Awards of such holder) shall receive from the
Exchange

 



      
 

 



 

Agent, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) (the " _Fractional Share
Consideration_ ") in an amount representing such holders proportionate
interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent for the
account of all such holders of New Holdco Shares which would otherwise be
issued (the " _Excess Offer Shares_ "). The sale of the Excess Offer Shares by
the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE and shall be executed in
round lots to the extent practicable. The proceeds resulting from the sale of
the Excess Offer Shares shall be free of commissions, transfer Taxes and other
out-of-pocket transaction costs. The net proceeds of such sale will be
distributed to the holders of Bemis Shares or Bemis Equity Awards whose Bemis
Shares or Bemis Equity Awards were validly converted into the right to receive
New Holdco Shares with each such holder receiving an amount of such proceeds
proportionate to the amount of fractional interests which such holder would
otherwise have been entitled to receive. The net proceeds credited for any
fractional New Holdco Shares will be determined on the average net proceeds
per New Holdco Share. Any such sale shall be made within 10 Business Days
after the Effective Time, or such shorter period as may be required by
applicable Law.

a timely basis, all forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents
required to be filed or furnished by it with or to the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act since January 1, 2016 (the " _Applicable
Date_ ") (the forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents filed
with or furnished to the SEC since the Applicable Date and those filed with or
furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement, together with
any exhibits and schedules thereto and any information incorporated by
reference therein, in each case as amended since the date of their filing and
prior to the date hereof, collectively the " _Bemis Filings_ "). Each of the
Bemis Filings, at the time of its filing or being furnished complied or, if
not yet filed or furnished, will at the time of being filed or furnished
comply, in each case, in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the
Bemis Filings, and the applicable requirements of the NYSE. As of their
respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of
the date of such amendment), the Bemis Filings did not, and each Bemis Filing
filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement
will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, to Bemiss knowledge,
none of the Bemis Filings is the subject of ongoing SEC review, inquiry,
investigation or challenge or the subject of any outstanding or unresolved SEC
comments.

 



 

(b) Each of the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements
included in or incorporated by reference into the Bemis Filings (including the
related notes and schedules) fairly presents or, in the case of the Bemis
Filings filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in each
case, in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the
consolidated financial

 



      
 

 



 

position of Bemis and the Bemis Subsidiaries, as of the dates thereof and
their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject to, in the case of any unaudited interim financial statements,
normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments that are not and will not be
material in amount or effect).

 



 

Section 3.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Bemis has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) sufficient to comply in
all material respects with all legal and accounting requirements applicable to
Bemis and the Bemis Subsidiaries and as otherwise as required by Rule 13a-15
or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Bemiss disclosure controls and procedures
are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by Bemis in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Bemiss management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). Bemis, each Bemis
Subsidiary and each of their respective officers and directors in their
capacities as such are in material compliance with, and, since the Applicable
Date, have materially complied with, the applicable provisions of Sarbanes-
Oxley Act and the Exchange Act. Based on its most recent evaluation of
internal controls over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, Bemiss
management has disclosed to Bemiss auditors and the audit committee of the
Bemis Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect Bemiss ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Bemiss internal
control over financial reporting. Bemis has made available prior to the date
of this Agreement to Amcor (x) either materials relating to or a summary of
any disclosure of matters described in clauses (i) or (ii) in the preceding
sentence made by management of Bemis to its auditors and audit committee on or
after the Applicable Date and prior to the date of this Agreement and (y) any
material communication on or after the Applicable Date and prior to the date
of this Agreement made by management of Bemis or its auditors to the audit
committee as required by the listing standards of the NYSE, the audit
committees charter or professional standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board. Since the Applicable Date and prior to the date of this
Agreement, no complaints from any source regarding a material violation of
accounting procedures, internal accounting controls or auditing matters or
compliance with Law, including from any current or former employee of Bemis or
any Bemis Subsidiary regarding questionable accounting, auditing or legal
compliance matters have, to the knowledge of Bemis, been received by Bemis.

any disclosure set forth in one section or subsection of the Amcor Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to, and shall be deemed to
apply to and qualify, the section or subsection of this Agreement to which it
corresponds in number and each other section or subsection of this Agreement

with, related to or in contemplation of any Bemis Competing Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Bemis Competing Proposal;

 



 

(iv) amend, grant any waiver or release under or fail to enforce any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities
of Bemis or any of the Bemis Subsidiaries, unless the Bemis Board of Directors
determines after considering advice from outside legal counsel that the

applicable Law;

 



 

(v) approve any Person becoming an "interested shareholder" under Section

under Rule 14e-2(a) (any of the foregoing in this _Section 5.3(a)(vii)_, a "
_Bemis Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Bemis Board of Directors from (A)
complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with regard to a Bemis
Competing Proposal or (B) issuing "stop, look and listen" disclosure or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act; provided, however, that any such disclosure or statement that
constitutes or contains a Bemis Adverse Recommendation Change shall be subject
to the provisions of this _Section 5.3(a)_ (it being understood, for the
avoidance of doubt, that a disclosure that constitutes only a customary "stop,
look and listen" statement or similar communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not in and of itself be deemed
to be a Bemis Adverse Recommendation Change).

 



 

Bemis shall, and Bemis shall cause the Bemis Subsidiaries and each of its and
the Bemis Subsidiaries respective directors, officers and employees to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and the Bemis Subsidiaries
respective third-party consultants, financial advisors, accountants, legal
counsel, investment bankers and other third party agents, advisors and
representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Bemis Competing Proposal, or proposal or offer that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Bemis Competing Proposal. Bemis will promptly (and in
each case within 24 hours from the date of this Agreement) request from each
Person (and such Persons Representatives) that has executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of making a Bemis Competing
Proposal to return or destroy (as provided in the terms of such
confidentiality agreement) all confidential information concerning Bemis or
any Bemis Subsidiary and shall promptly (and in each case within 24 hours from
the date of this Agreement) terminate all physical and electronic data access
previously granted to each such Person.

 



 

(b) _Responding to Bemis Competing Proposals_. Prior to the time, but not
after, the Bemis Shareholder Approval is obtained, Bemis and its
Representatives may, in response to a bona fide written Bemis Competing
Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a
breach of this _Section 5.3_, (i) contact the Person who made such Bemis
Competing Proposal and its Representatives solely to (x) clarify the terms and
conditions thereof or (y) inform such Person of the existence of the
provisions contained in this _Section 5.3_; (ii) provide access to
information regarding Bemis or any of its Subsidiaries in response to a
request therefor to the Person who made such Bemis Competing Proposal and such
Persons Representatives; _provided_ that such information has previously
been, or is promptly (in no event later than 24 hours), made available to
Amcor and that, prior to furnishing any such non-public information, Bemis
receives from the Person making such Bemis Competing Proposal an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive in all
material respects on such Person with respect to confidentiality as the
Confidentiality Agreement (each such confidentiality agreement, a " _Bemis
Competing Proposal NDA_ "); and (iii) participate in discussions or
negotiations with any such Person and its Representatives regarding such Bemis
Competing Proposal, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in
clause (ii) or (iii) above, the Bemis Board of Directors determines in good
faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation that (A) the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and (B) such Bemis Competing Proposal either
constitutes a Bemis Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Bemis Superior Proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Notice_. Bemis shall promptly notify Amcor (in no event later than 24
hours) of (i) the receipt by Bemis (or any of its Representatives) of any
Bemis Competing Proposal or any inquiries, proposals or offers that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Bemis Competing Proposal, (ii) the receipt
by Bemis (or any of its Representatives) of any request for non-public
information relating to Bemis or any of its Subsidiaries from any Person who
has made or is reasonably likely to be seeking to make a Bemis Competing
Proposal, or (iii) any discussions or negotiations with respect to a Bemis
Competing Proposal sought to be initiated or continued by any Person with
Bemis, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives. Each such
notice shall indicate the name of such Person and the material terms and
conditions (including price) of any proposals, offers or requests (including,
if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements). Following delivery of the initial notice, Bemis shall
keep Amcor informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and material
terms of any such proposals, offers or requests (including any amendments
thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations. Neither Bemis
nor any of its Subsidiaries will enter into any agreement with any Person
which prohibits Bemis from providing any information to Amcor in accordance
with, or otherwise complying with, this _Section 5.3_.

 



 

(d) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" _Bemis Competing Proposal_ " means, other than the Transactions, any offer
or proposal from any Person or group of Persons, other than Amcor and its
Subsidiaries, relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase
of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of Bemis and its Subsidiaries or 20%
or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Bemis, in each case, by
such Person or group of Persons, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-
tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such
Person or group of Persons (or their stockholders) beneficially owning 20% or
more of any class of equity or voting securities of Bemis or (iii) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, sale of all or
substantially all of the assets, reorganization, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving Bemis or any
of its Subsidiaries that would result in such Person or group of Persons
beneficially owning 20% or more of the consolidated assets of Bemis and its
Subsidiaries or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
Bemis.

 



 

" _Bemis Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Bemis Competing
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.3_ (with
references to 20% being deemed to be replaced with references to 50%), which
the Bemis Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation to be (i) more favorable to the Bemis Shareholders from a financial
point of view than the Transactions and (ii) reasonably capable of being
completed as proposed, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), taking
into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of this
Agreement and the Transactions (including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement and the Transactions proposed by Amcor in response to such Bemis
Competing Proposal or otherwise) and such Bemis Competing Proposal.

 



 

(e) _Fiduciary Exception_. Notwithstanding _Section 5.3(a)(vi)_ and _Section
5.3(a)(vii)_, but subject (as applicable) to compliance with _Section
5.3(f)_, prior to the time, but not after, the Bemis Shareholder Approval is
obtained, the Bemis Board of Directors may (A) make a Bemis Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or (B) terminate this Agreement in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ in order to concurrently enter into a definitive
agreement for a Bemis Superior Proposal, in either case if (i)(x) in the case
of such an action taken in connection with a Bemis Competing Proposal, the
Bemis Competing Proposal is not withdrawn and the Bemis Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Bemis
Competing Proposal constitutes a Bemis Superior Proposal; or (y) in the case
of any such Bemis Adverse Recommendation Change taken other than in connection
with a Bemis Competing Proposal, there is a material event, development,
circumstance, occurrence or change in circumstances or facts (including any
material change in probability or magnitude of circumstances) that was not
known to the Bemis Board of Directors on the date of this Agreement (or if
known, the consequences of which were not known as of the date of this
Agreement) (an " _Intervening Event_ ") and (ii) the Bemis Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, and taking into account
any proposal by Amcor to amend the terms of this Agreement and the
Transactions in accordance with _Section 5.3(f)_, that the failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) _Last Look_. The Bemis Board of Directors shall not make a Bemis Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)(A)_ or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)(B)_ and _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ unless,
prior to making such Bemis Adverse Recommendation Change or such termination
of this Agreement, (i) Bemis notifies Amcor in writing of its intention to do
so at least four Business Days before taking such action, which such
notification shall attach, in the case of a Bemis Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)(A)_ in response to a Bemis Superior
Proposal or termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)(B)_ and
_Section 8.1(b)(ii)_, any proposed draft agreements (including financing
arrangements and other ancillary agreements) in Bemiss or its Subsidiaries
or its or their Representatives possession and other material definitive
documentation relating to such Bemis Competing Proposal in Bemiss or its
Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives possession and the identity of
the Person making the Bemis Competing Proposal, or, in the case of a Bemis
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, a
reasonably detailed description of the facts relating to such Bemis Adverse
Recommendation Change, (ii) during such four Business Day period, if requested
by Amcor, Bemis and its Representatives shall have discussed and negotiated in
good faith with Amcor and its Representatives regarding any proposal by Amcor
to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Transactions in response to such
Bemis Superior Proposal or other potential Bemis Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable, and (iii) after such four Business Day period, the
Bemis Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith, after
considering advice from outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, and taking into account any proposal by
Amcor to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Transactions made during
such period, that (A) in the case of a Bemis Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)(A)_ in response to a Bemis Superior Proposal or
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)(B)_ and _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_, such Bemis Competing Proposal continues to constitute a Bemis
Superior Proposal and (B) in any case, the failure to take such action would
continue to reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to the financial or other material terms of any such Bemis Superior Proposal
shall require a new written notification from Bemis and a new notice period
under _Section 5.3(f)(i)_ (except that such negotiation period shall be for
three Business Days),

 



      
 

 



 

during which period Bemis shall be required to comply with the other
requirements of this _Section 5.3(f)_ anew).

authorized committee thereof.

Competing Proposal pursuant to a publicly announced takeover bid under
Australian Law (any of the foregoing in this _Section 5.4(a)(vii)_, an "
_Amcor Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

making a customary statement that Amcor Shareholders should, with respect to
an unsolicited Amcor Competing Proposal and during a period of no more than
ten business days from the date of commencement of such Amcor Competing

all confidential information concerning Amcor or any Amcor Subsidiary and
shall promptly (and in each case within 24 hours from the date of this
Agreement) terminate all physical and electronic data access previously
granted to each such Person.

after, the Amcor Shareholder Approval is obtained, Amcor and its
Representatives may, in response to a bona fide written Amcor Competing
Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a
breach of this _Section 5.4_, (i) contact the Person who made such Amcor

request therefor to the Person who made such Amcor Competing Proposal and such
Persons Representatives; _provided_ that such information has previously
been, or is promptly (in no event later than 24 hours), made available to
Amcor and that, prior to furnishing any such non-public information, Amcor
receives from the Person making such Amcor Competing Proposal an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive in all
material respects on such

 



      
 

 



 

Person with respect to confidentiality as the Confidentiality Agreement (each
such confidentiality agreement, an " _Amcor Competing Proposal NDA_ "); and
(iii) participate in discussions or negotiations with any such Person and its
Representatives regarding such Amcor Competing Proposal, if, and only if,
prior to taking any action described in clause (ii) or (iii) above, the Amcor
Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation that
(A) the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B)
such Amcor Competing Proposal either constitutes an Amcor Superior Proposal or
would reasonably be expected to result in an Amcor Superior Proposal.

 



 

(c) _Notice_. Amcor shall promptly notify Bemis (in no event later than 24
hours) of (i) the receipt by Amcor (or any of its Representatives) of any
Amcor Competing Proposal or any inquiries, proposals or offers that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Amcor Competing Proposal, (ii) the
receipt by Amcor (or any of its Representatives) of any request for non-public
information relating to Amcor or any of its Subsidiaries from any Person who
has made or is reasonably likely to be seeking to make an Amcor Competing
Proposal, or (iii) any discussions or negotiations with respect to an Amcor
Competing Proposal sought to be initiated or continued by any Person with
Amcor, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives. Each such
notice shall indicate the name of such Person and the material terms and
conditions (including price) of any proposals, offers or requests (including,
if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements). Following delivery of the initial notice, Amcor shall
keep Bemis informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and material
terms of any such proposals, offers or requests (including any amendments
thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations. Neither Amcor
nor any of its Subsidiaries will enter into any agreement with any Person
which prohibits Amcor from providing any information to Bemis in accordance
with, or otherwise complying with, this _Section 5.4_.

 



 

(d) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" _Amcor Competing Proposal_ " means, other than the Transactions, any offer
or proposal from any Person or group of Persons, other than New Holdco and its
Subsidiaries, relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase
of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of Amcor and its Subsidiaries or 20%
or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Amcor, in each case, by
such Person or group of Persons, (ii) any takeover bid that, if completed,
would result in such Person or group of Persons (or their stockholders)
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
Amcor or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
sale of all or substantially all of the assets, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving Amcor or any of its Subsidiaries that would result in such Person or
group of Persons beneficially owning 20% or more of the consolidated assets of
Amcor and its Subsidiaries or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of Amcor.

 



 

" _Amcor Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide, written Amcor Competing
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.4_ (with
references to 20% being deemed to be replaced with references to 50%), which
the Amcor Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized

 



      
 

 



 

reputation to be (i) more favorable to Amcor Shareholders from a financial
point of view than the Transactions and (ii) reasonably capable of being
completed as proposed, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), taking
into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of this
Agreement and the Transactions (including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement and the Transactions proposed by Bemis in response to such Amcor
Competing Proposal or otherwise) and such Amcor Competing Proposal.

 



 

(e) _Fiduciary Exception_. Notwithstanding _Section 5.4(a)(vi)_ and _Section
5.4(a)(vii)_, but subject (as applicable) to compliance with _Section
5.4(f)_, prior to the time, but not after, the Amcor Shareholder Approval is
obtained, the Amcor Board of Directors may (A) make an Amcor Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or (B) terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ in order to concurrently enter into a definitive
agreement for an Amcor Superior Proposal, in either case if (i)(x) in the case
of such an action taken in connection with an Amcor Competing Proposal, the
Amcor Competing Proposal is not withdrawn and the Amcor Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Amcor
Competing Proposal constitutes an Amcor Superior Proposal; or (y) in the case
of any such Amcor Adverse Recommendation Change taken other than in connection
with an Amcor Competing Proposal, there is an Intervening Event (with
references to Bemis in such definition being references to Amcor and it being
understood that an opinion by the Independent Expert in the IER that the
Transactions are not in the best interests of Amcor Shareholders shall be
deemed to qualify as an Intervening Event in relation to Amcor) and (ii) the
Amcor Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, and taking into account any proposal by Bemis to amend the terms
of this Agreement and the Transactions in accordance with _Section 5.4(f)_,
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) _Last Look_. The Amcor Board of Directors shall not make an Amcor Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.4(e)(A)_ or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.4(e)(B)_ and _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ unless,
prior to making such Amcor Adverse Recommendation Change or such termination
of this Agreement, (i) Amcor notifies Bemis in writing of its intention to do
so at least four Business Days before taking such action, which such
notification shall attach, in the case of an Amcor Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to _Section 5.4(e)(A)_ in response to an Amcor Superior
Proposal or termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.4(e)(B)_ and
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, all proposed draft agreements (including financing
arrangements and other ancillary agreements) in Amcors or its Subsidiaries
or its or their Representatives possession and other material definitive
documentation relating to such Amcor Competing Proposal in Amcors or its
Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives possession and the identity of
the Person making the Amcor Competing Proposal, or, in the case of an Amcor
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event (with
references to Bemis in such definition being references to Amcor and it being
understood that an opinion by the Independent Expert in the IER that the
Transactions are not in the best interests of Amcor Shareholders shall be
deemed to qualify as an Intervening Event in relation to Amcor), a reasonably
detailed description of the facts relating to such Amcor Adverse
Recommendation Change, (ii) during such four Business Day period, if requested
by Bemis, Amcor and its Representatives shall have discussed and negotiated in
good faith with Bemis and its

 



       
 

 



 

Representatives regarding any proposal by Bemis to amend the terms of this
Agreement and the Transactions in response to such Amcor Superior Proposal or
other potential Amcor Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, and (iii)
after such four Business Day period, the Amcor Board of Directors shall have
determined in good faith, after considering advice from outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, and taking into
account any proposal by Bemis to amend the terms of this Agreement and the
Transactions made during such period, that (A) in the case of an Amcor Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.4(e)(A)_ in response to an Amcor
Superior Proposal or termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
5.4(e)(B)_ and _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, such Amcor Competing Proposal continues
to constitute an Amcor Superior Proposal and (B) in any case, the failure to
take such action would continue to reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed
that any amendment to the financial or other material terms of any such Amcor
Superior Proposal shall require a new written notification from Amcor and a
new notice period under _Section 5.4(f)(i)_ (except that such negotiation
period shall be for three Business Days), during which period Amcor shall be
required to comply with the other requirements of this _Section 5.4(f)_
anew).

 



 

(g) References in this _Section 5.4_ to the " _Amcor Board of Directors_ "
shall mean the Amcor Board of Directors or, to the extent applicable, a duly
authorized committee thereof.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Preparation of the Scheme Booklet, the Proxy Statement and the
Form S-4; Bemis Special Meeting; Amcor Scheme Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, each of
Amcor, New Holdco and Bemis shall cooperate in preparing and Amcor (in the
case of the Scheme Booklet) and New Holdco and Bemis (in the case of the Form
S-4) shall cause to be filed:

 



 

(i) with the SEC, (A) the proxy statement relating to the matters to be
submitted to the Bemis Shareholders at the Bemis Special Meeting, which will
be used as a prospectus of New Holdco with respect to the New Holdco Shares
issuable in the Merger (such proxy and prospectus materials, and any
amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and (B) a
registration statement on Form S-4 (of which the Proxy Statement will form a
part as a prospectus of New Holdco) pursuant to which the offer and sale of
New Holdco Shares in the Merger will be registered pursuant to the Securities
Act (together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Form
S-4_"); and

 



 

(ii) with ASIC (and, subsequently, the Court), the Scheme Booklet; _provided_
that the Scheme Booklet will be filed with ASIC as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the initial filing of the Form S-4 with the SEC (subject
to _Section 5.5(g)_).

 



 

Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC, have the
Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective by the
SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable (subject to, after consultation with
Bemis, postponement of such effectiveness if Amcor reasonably considers it
necessary or advisable in connection with a postponement of the Scheme Meeting
and/or the Bemis Special Meeting pursuant to this _Section 5.5_), keep the
Form S-4

 



      
 

 



 

effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Scheme and the Merger and
mail the Proxy Statement to the Bemis Shareholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective, and (ii) respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments from ASIC or the Court to
the Scheme Booklet and mail the Scheme Booklet to the Amcor Shareholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after its approval by the Court at the
First Court Hearing. Amcor and Bemis will cooperate in good faith to
coordinate the timing of the mailing of the Proxy Statement and the Scheme
Booklet with the objective of mailing the Proxy Statement and the Scheme
Booklet as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof
(subject to, after consultation with Bemis, postponement of such mailing if
Amcor reasonably considers it necessary or advisable in connection with a
postponement of the Scheme Meeting and/or the Bemis Special Meeting pursuant
to this _Section 5.5_).

 



 

(b) Each Party shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt
thereof, provide the other Parties with copies of any written comments with
respect to the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or the Scheme Booklet that are
received from the SEC or ASIC (as applicable). Each Party shall cooperate and
provide the other Party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 prior to
filing such with the SEC or the Scheme Booklet prior to its filing with the
Court or ASIC (other than any filing, amendment or supplement in connection
with a Bemis Adverse Recommendation Change or an Amcor Adverse Recommendation
Change, in each case that is made in accordance with _Section 5.3_ or
_Section 5.4_, as applicable) and consider such other Partys comments in
good faith, and each Party will promptly provide the other Party with a copy
of all such filings made with the SEC, the Court and ASIC. Amcor shall request
that the Court hold the First Court Hearing as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the conclusion of ASICs review of the Scheme Booklet
pursuant to section 411(2) of the Australian Act.

 



 

(c) Each Party shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, furnish all
information concerning such Party required to be included in the Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4 pursuant to the Securities Act and Exchange Act,
and the Scheme Booklet pursuant to the Australian Act, the Australian
Regulations, ASX Listing Rules and RG 60, including with respect to the
preparation and inclusion of any required pro forma or audited financial
information (including by preparing, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP or with a reconciliation to U.S.
GAAP), and shall provide any other information concerning such Person and its
Subsidiaries to the other Parties to be included therein and provide such
other assistance and cooperation as may be reasonably requested by such other
Party in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4, the Scheme
Booklet and the resolution of any comments to any of the foregoing received
from the SEC, the Court or ASIC. Without limiting the foregoing, Amcor shall
be responsible for preparing or causing to be prepared as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement any New Holdco
financial information or pro forma financial information required to be
included in the Form S-4 or the Scheme Booklet, and Bemis shall reasonably
cooperate with Amcor in the preparation of such information. Each Party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its independent registered public
accounting firm to consent to the inclusion or incorporation by reference of
its audit reports on the annual audited consolidated financial statements
included in the Form S-4 and, if requested by Amcor, the Scheme Booklet.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Each of Amcor and Bemis shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the information relating to Amcor and its Subsidiaries (including New
Holdco) in the case of Amcor, and relating to Bemis and the Bemis Subsidiaries
in the case of Bemis, contained in the Form S-4, the Proxy Statement and the
Scheme Booklet will not, (i) in the case of the Proxy Statement, on the date
the Proxy Statement (and any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed
to the Bemis Shareholders or at the time of the Bemis Special Meeting (as it
may be adjourned or postponed in accordance with the terms hereof), (ii) in
the case of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement, at the time the Form S-4
(and any amendment or supplement thereto) is declared effective or any post-
effective amendment thereto or to the Proxy Statement is declared effective,
or (iii) in the case of the Scheme Booklet, on the date the Scheme Booklet is
first mailed to Amcor Shareholders, or at the time of the Scheme Meeting, with
respect to each of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), contain any untrue
statement of any material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading and, in respect of the Scheme Booklet, be misleading or deceptive
in any material respect (whether by omission or otherwise), including in the
form and context in which it appears in the Scheme Booklet. If any information
relating to Bemis or Amcor, respectively, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, should be discovered by Bemis or Amcor which, in the reasonable
judgment of Bemis or Amcor, respectively, should be set forth in an amendment
of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4, the Proxy Statement or the Scheme
Booklet so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, or, in respect of the Scheme Booklet, not
be misleading or deceptive in any material respect (whether by omission or
otherwise), including in the form and context in which it appears in the
Scheme Booklet, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties, and Bemis or Amcor shall cooperate in the prompt
filing with (to the extent required by applicable Law) the SEC, ASIC or the
Court (as applicable) of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the
Scheme Booklet, the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and, to the extent
required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to the Amcor Shareholders or Bemis Shareholders (as applicable).
The Scheme Booklet shall contain a responsibility statement to the effect that
(A) Bemis is responsible for the information about Bemis and its Subsidiaries
contained in the Scheme Booklet and (B) Amcor is responsible for the
information about Amcor and the Amcor Subsidiaries (including New Holdco), the
Scheme Consideration and such other matters as Amcor is responsible for under
applicable Law, contained in the Scheme Booklet.

 



 

(e) Bemis shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Bemis Governing
Documents and subject to _Section 5.5(g)_, cause the Bemis Special Meeting to
be duly called and held as promptly as reasonably practicable after clearance
of the Form S-4 by the SEC for the purpose of obtaining the Bemis Shareholder
Approval. Subject to _Section 5.3_, Bemis shall, through the Bemis Board of
Directors, make the Bemis Board Recommendation, include such Bemis Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and solicit and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Bemis Shareholder Approval. Once Bemis has established a
record date for the Bemis Special Meeting, Bemis shall not, without the prior
written consent of Amcor (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), adjourn, postpone or otherwise delay the Bemis Special Meeting;
_provided_ that Bemis shall have the right, following consultation with Amcor,
to make one or more successive postponements, adjournments or other delays of
the Bemis Special Meeting of not more than 15 days individually (i) if, on a
date for which the

 



      
 

 



 

Bemis Special Meeting is scheduled, Bemis has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of Bemis Shares to obtain the Bemis
Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, or (ii) if
insufficient Bemis Shares would be represented at the Bemis Shareholder
Meeting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Bemis
Shareholder Meeting, (iii) if such adjournment, postponement or delay is
reasonably determined to be required by applicable Law, including to the
extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided or made available to Bemis Shareholders or to
permit dissemination of information which is material to the Bemis
Shareholders voting at the Bemis Special Meeting and to give Bemis
Shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any such supplement or amendment or
other information; _provided_ , that the 15-day period provided for in this
sentence will not apply to adjournment, postponement or delay pursuant to this
section (iii) and any such adjournment or postponement will allow for
reasonable additional time (as reasonably determined by Bemis in consultation
with outside legal counsel), or (iv) if the Scheme Meeting has been adjourned
or postponed by Amcor in accordance with _Section 5.5(f)_, to the extent
necessary to enable the Bemis Special Meeting and the Scheme Meeting to be
held within a single period of 24 consecutive hours as contemplated by
_Section 5.5(g)_. Other than pursuant to section (iii) or (iv) of the prior
sentence or with the prior written consent of Amcor, the Bemis Special Meeting
may not be adjourned or postponed to a date that is, in the aggregate, more
than 60 days after the date for which the Bemis Special Meeting was originally
scheduled. Once Bemis has established a record date for the Bemis Special
Meeting, Bemis shall not change such record date or establish a different
record date for the Bemis Special Meeting without the prior written consent of
Amcor (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (x)
following consultation with Amcor, required to do so by applicable Law or the
Bemis Governing Documents, (y) Bemis reasonably determines it is necessary or
advisable to obtain the Bemis Shareholder Approval or (z) it is required in
connection with any adjournment or postponement of the Bemis Special Meeting
permitted by the preceding sentences (it being understood that in the case of
this clause (z), Bemis shall consult with and consider in good faith the views
of Amcor in connection with setting such new record date). Without the prior
written consent of Amcor, the approval of this Agreement shall be the only
matter (other than (1) matters of procedure and matters required by applicable
Law to be voted on by the Bemis Shareholders in connection with the adoption
of this Agreement or the Transactions (including a "say-on-golden-parachute"
non-binding advisory vote) and (2) any required votes of the Bemis
Shareholders with respect to the contemplated governing documents of New
Holdco) that Bemis shall propose to be acted on by the Bemis Shareholders at
the Bemis Special Meeting. During the proxy solicitation period Bemis shall
keep Amcor reasonably informed of the number of proxy votes received in
respect of resolutions to be proposed at the Bemis Special Meeting. Bemis
agrees that, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section
8.1_, Bemiss obligations to cause the Bemis Special Meeting to be duly called
and held in accordance with this _Section 5.5_ shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to Bemis of any Bemis Competing Proposal or the making of any
Bemis Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

(f) Amcor shall, in accordance with applicable Law and as promptly as
reasonably practicable, apply for an order of the Court pursuant to subsection
411(1) of the Australian Act directing Amcor to convene the Scheme Meeting
and, as soon as reasonably practicable after such order is made by the Court,
request ASIC to register the explanatory statement included in the Scheme
Booklet in relation to the Scheme in accordance with section 412(6) of the

 



      
 

 



 

Corporations Act, and, subject to _Section 5.5(g)_, cause the Scheme Meeting
to be duly called and held in accordance with such order of the Court and as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Scheme Booklet
(as approved by the Court) for the purposes of obtaining the Amcor Shareholder
Approval. Subject to _Section 5.4_, Amcor shall, through the Amcor Board of
Directors, make the Amcor Board Recommendation, include such Amcor Board
Recommendation in the Scheme Booklet, and solicit and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Amcor Shareholder Approval. Once Amcor has established a
date for the Scheme Meeting, Amcor shall not, without the prior written
consent of Bemis (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
adjourn, postpone or otherwise delay the Scheme Meeting; _provided_ that Amcor
shall have the right, following consultation with Bemis, to make one or more
successive postponements, adjournments or delays of the Scheme Meeting of not
more than 15 days individually (i) if, on a date for which the Scheme Meeting
is scheduled, Amcor has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of Amcor Shares to obtain the Amcor Shareholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, (ii) if such adjournment, postponement or delay is
reasonably determined to be (x) required by applicable Law (including any
Order of the Court), including to the extent necessary to ensure that any
necessary supplement or amendment to the Scheme Booklet is provided or made
available to Amcor Shareholders or to permit dissemination of information
which is material to the Amcor Shareholders voting at the Scheme Meeting and
to give Amcor Shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any such supplement or
amendment or other information, or (y) necessary or advisable in the event
that one or more of the required Governmental Consents under Antitrust Laws
required to be obtained pursuant to Condition 2(d) and the status of which
would be material to Amcor Shareholders voting at the Scheme Meeting has not
be obtained at such time; _provided_ , that the 15-day period provided for in
this sentence will not apply to adjournment or postponement pursuant to this
section (ii) and any such adjournment or postponement will allow for
reasonable additional time (as reasonably determined by Amcor in consultation
with outside legal counsel), (iii) if insufficient Amcor Shares would be
represented at the Amcor Shareholder Meeting to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Amcor Shareholder Meeting or (iv) if the Bemis
Special Meeting has been adjourned or postponed by Bemis in accordance with
_Section 5.5(e)_, to the extent necessary to enable the Scheme Meeting and
the Bemis Special Meeting to be held within a single period of 24 consecutive
hours as contemplated by _Section 5.5(g)_. Other than pursuant to section
(ii) or (iv) of the prior sentence or with the prior written consent of Bemis,
the Amcor Shareholder Meeting may not be adjourned or postponed to a date that
is, in the aggregate, more than 60 days after the date for which the Amcor
Shareholder Meeting was originally scheduled. Once Amcor has established a
record date for the Amcor Shareholder Meeting, Amcor shall not change such
record date or establish a different record date for the Amcor Shareholder
Meeting without the prior written consent of Bemis (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (x) following consultation with
Bemis, required to do so by the Court, applicable Law or the Amcor Governing
Documents, (y) Amcor reasonably determines it is necessary or advisable to
obtain the Amcor Shareholder Approval or (z) it is required in connection with
any adjournment or postponement of the Amcor Shareholder Meeting permitted by
the preceding sentences (it being understood that in the case of this clause
(z), Amcor shall consult with and consider in good faith the views of Bemis in
connection with setting such new record date). Without the prior written
consent of Bemis, the approval of this Agreement shall be the only matter
(other than (1) matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to
be voted on by the Amcor Shareholders in connection with the approval of the

 



      
 

 



 

Scheme or the Transactions and (2) any required votes of the Amcor
Shareholders with respect to the contemplated governing documents of New
Holdco) that Amcor shall propose to be acted on by the Amcor Shareholders at
the Amcor Shareholder Meeting. During the proxy solicitation period, Amcor
shall keep Bemis reasonably informed of the number of proxy votes received in
respect of resolutions to be proposed at the Scheme Meeting. Amcor shall
request that the Court hold the Second Court Hearing as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Amcor Shareholder Approval. Amcor agrees that,
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, Amcors
obligations to cause the Scheme Meeting to be duly called and held in
accordance with this _Section 5.5_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected
by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
Amcor of any Amcor Competing Proposal or the making of any Amcor Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is the intention of
the Parties that, and each of the Parties shall cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to cause that, the date and time of the Bemis Special
Meeting and the Scheme Meeting shall be coordinated such that they occur
within a single period of 24 consecutive hours, and in any event as close in
time as possible, and at a time (taking into account scheduled Court recess)
such that the Second Court Hearing could be held promptly thereafter.

Subsidiaries be required to propose, commit to or effect any Restriction (and
Bemis and its Subsidiaries shall not propose, commit to or effect any
Restriction without the prior written consent of Amcor, which may, subject to

the Amcor Board of Directors has effected an Amcor Adverse Recommendation
Change in accordance with _Section 5.4_ and such release, announcement or

indemnification of officers, directors, employees and agents or other
fiduciaries and advancement of expenses, and no such provision shall be
amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights or protections thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time without the consent of such Indemnified Party.

 



 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Bemis shall be permitted to, and if

occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for an aggregate annual cost of
300% of the current annual premium.

shall be required to execute any definitive financing documents pursuant to
which Indebtedness is incurred prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the receipt of any written
request by Amcor to do so, Bemis shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to commence offers to purchase and/or consent solicitations related to any or
all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount and all other amounts due of
any or all series of notes, debentures or other debt securities of Bemis or
its Subsidiaries, including any Bemis Senior Notes, on such terms and
conditions, including pricing terms, that are specified and requested, from
time to time, by Amcor (each a " _Debt Tender Offer_ " and collectively, the "
_Debt Tender Offers_ ") and Amcor shall assist Bemis in connection therewith.
Bemis shall request that Bemiss counsel provide such legal opinions as may be
reasonably requested by Amcor that are customary or necessary in connection
with the Debt Tender Offers, if any. Amcor shall only request Bemis to conduct
any Debt Tender Offer in compliance with the documents governing the
applicable debt securities and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including
Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the

 



      
 

 



 

foregoing, the closing of each Debt Tender Offer, if any, shall be conditioned
on the occurrence of the Merger Closing. Subject to the preceding sentence,
Bemis shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives to,
provide all cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Amcor in connection
with any Debt Tender Offer, including using commercially reasonable efforts in
assisting with the preparation of the related offer to purchase and letter of
transmittal. Bemis (i) shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Tender
Offers (other than the occurrence of the Merger Closing) and make any change
to the Debt Tender Offers, in each case, as may be reasonably requested by
Amcor and (ii) shall not, without the written consent of Amcor, waive any
condition to any Debt Tender Offer or make any changes to any Debt Tender
Offer.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.13_ shall
require Bemis, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their directors or
officers to commit to any action that is not contingent upon the Merger
Closing or that would be effective prior to the Merger Closing, or bear any
cost or expense or incur any liability prior to the Merger Closing that is not
subject to reimbursement or indemnification under this _Section 6.13_. Amcor
shall (i) promptly, upon request by Bemis, reimburse Bemis for all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable outside
attorneys fees) incurred by Bemis pursuant to this _Section 6.13_ and (ii)
indemnify and hold harmless Bemis, the Bemis Subsidiaries and their respective
affiliates and their Representatives from and against any and all losses
suffered or incurred by any of them to the extent arising as a result of
Bemiss performance of its obligations under this _Section 6.13_, except to
the extent suffered or incurred as a result of gross negligence, bad faith,
willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement on the part of Bemis,
the Bemis Subsidiaries and their respective affiliates and their
Representatives.

 



 

Section 6.14 _Tax Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, none of Amcor, the
Amcor Subsidiaries, Bemis, the Bemis Subsidiaries, New Holdco, or Merger Sub
shall take or cause to be taken, or fail to take or cause to be taken, any
action, which action or failure to act could reasonably be expected to (i)
prevent the Merger and the Scheme from qualifying for the Intended Tax
Treatment or (ii) cause New Holdco to be treated as a "surrogate foreign
corporation" within the meaning of Section 7874(a)(2)(B) of the Code as a
result of the Transactions. The Parties shall cooperate and use reasonable
best efforts to obtain the opinions or written advice described in Condition
3(d) and Condition 4(d), respectively. Amcor and Bemis shall afford, in a
timely manner, all such cooperation and assistance as may reasonably be
requested by the other party to obtain an opinion or other advice from Amcor
Tax Advisor or Bemis Tax Advisor, as applicable, relating to the application
of Section 7874 of the Code, the Treasury Regulations (whether final,
temporary or proposed) promulgated thereunder, or official interpretations
thereof as set forth in published guidance by the IRS (" _Section 7874
Rules_"), to the Transactions; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt,
no opinion relating to the application of Section 7874 Rules is required for
Amcor or Bemis under this Agreement. In the event that (i) neither Amcor Tax
Advisor nor Bemis Tax Advisor is able to provide the opinions or written
advice described in Condition 3(d) and Condition 4(d) or (ii) Amcor Tax
Advisor is unable to provide to Amcor, or Bemis Tax Advisor is unable to
provide to Bemis, as a result of a Tax Law Change since the date of this
Agreement, an opinion or other written advice sought by Amcor or Bemis, as
applicable, at a "should" (or higher) level of comfort, that New Holdco would
not be treated as a United States domestic corporation for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a result of the Transactions (assuming for this purpose that
New Holdco would not

 



      
 

 



 

have been treated as a United States domestic corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes prior to the Tax Law Change), the Parties shall in good
faith discuss possible amendments and modifications to the Transactions in
order to permit either of Amcor Tax Advisor or Bemis Tax Advisor to deliver
such opinion or written advice, as applicable; provided that, nothing in this
_Section 6.14_ shall require a restructuring of the Transactions.

 



 

Section 6.15 _Treatment of Amcor Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) The Amcor Board of Directors may, as determined in its reasonable
discretion, at any time prior to the Scheme Closing, adopt such resolutions or
take such other actions (including procuring consent from holders of Amcor
Equity Awards, as required) as may be appropriate to adjust the terms of any
or all outstanding Amcor Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the
Scheme Implementation Date to provide that, at the Scheme Implementation, each
Amcor Equity Award shall be converted into a similar award denominated with
respect to, or settled in, an equal number of New Holdco Shares or CDIs (a "
_Converted Equity Award_ ").

 



 

(b) In addition to the foregoing, subject to the other terms of this Agreement
(including _Section 6.15(c)_), the Amcor Board of Directors may make any
additional adjustments to the terms of the Converted Equity Awards as it
reasonably deems advisable and appropriate.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.15_, each
Amcor Equity Award outstanding immediately prior to the Scheme Closing
entitling the holder thereof to a number of Amcor Shares shall be converted
into an award (i) denominated with respect to, or settled in, an equal number
of New Holdco Shares or CDIs and (ii) otherwise economically equivalent to
such Amcor Equity Award (including with respect to the exercise price of Amcor
Options); provided, that the foregoing clause (ii) shall not restrict Amcors
ability to modify the vesting criteria or schedule of any such Amcor Equity
Award.

 



 

Section 6.16 _Appeal Process_. If the Court refuses to make any orders
directing Amcor to convene the Scheme Meeting or approving the Scheme, Bemis
and Amcor shall:

 



 

(a) consult with each other in good faith as to whether to appeal the Courts
decision; and

 



 

(b) appeal the Court decision unless Bemis and Amcor agree otherwise or an
independent senior counsel opines that, in his or her view, an appeal would
have no reasonable prospect of success.

extent it would constitute a Material Restraint).

Antitrust Laws, such Law or Order will only result in a right to terminate

competent jurisdiction issues a final and non-appealable ruling upholding the
declination or refusal (as applicable) of the Court; provided that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this this _Section 8.1(i)_ shall not

to obtain from Amcor Tax Advisor or Bemis is unable to obtain from Bemis Tax
Advisor, as a result of a Tax Law Change since the date of this Agreement, an
opinion or other written advice sought by Amcor or Bemis, as applicable, at a
"should" (or higher) level of comfort, that New Holdco would not be treated as

Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ or (ii) Amcor from any
obligation to pay, if applicable, the Amcor Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.2(c)_; _provided_ further that no such termination shall relieve
or otherwise affect the lability of any Party for fraud or any Intentional
Breach of this Agreement by such Party prior to termination.

definitive agreement providing for a Bemis Competing Proposal, then Bemis
shall pay the Bemis Termination Fee concurrently with the earlier of such
entry or consummation; provided that solely for purposes of the second
sentence of this _Section 8.2(b)_, the term "Bemis Competing Proposal" shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 5.3(d)_, except that the
references to "20% or more" shall be deemed to be references to "more than
50%". In no event shall Bemis be required to pay the Bemis Termination Fee on
more than one occasion.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated (x) by Bemis pursuant to _Section
8.1(f)_, (y) by Amcor or Bemis pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section
8.1(i)_ in each case at a time when Bemis had the right to terminate pursuant

Amcor shall, within two Business Days after such termination in the case of
clause (x) or in the case of clause (y) with respect to a termination by
Bemis, or concurrently with such termination in the case of clause (y) with
respect to a termination by Amcor or in the case of clause (z), pay Bemis a

covenant of Amcor, (ii) prior to such termination referred to in clause (i) of
this sentence, but after the date of this Agreement, a bona fide Amcor
Competing Proposal shall have been publicly made to Amcor or any of its
Subsidiaries, shall have been made directly to the Amcor Shareholders
generally or shall have otherwise become public or any Person shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a bona
fide Amcor Competing Proposal or, in the case of termination by Bemis pursuant
to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_, an Amcor Competing Proposal shall have been made

months after the date of a termination in either of the cases referred to in
clauses (i)(A) and (i)(B) of this sentence of _Section 8.2(c)_, Amcor

(d) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, no Party would have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if Bemis fails to pay when due the Bemis Termination
Fee, if any, or if Amcor fails to pay when due the Amcor Termination Fee, if
any (any such amount, a " _Payment_ "), and, in order to obtain such Payment,
the Party entitled to receive such Payment (the " _Recipient_ ") commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the Party obligated to make such
Payment (the " _Payor_ ") for the applicable Payment, or any portion thereof,
the Payor shall pay to the Recipient its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the Payment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date
such Payment was required to be paid from such date through the date of full

upon payment of such amount, none of the Bemis Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) other than as

this Agreement resulted from, directly or indirectly,

 



       
 

 



 

an Intentional Breach of this Agreement by Bemis or such Intentional Breach by
Bemis shall cause the Scheme Closing or the Merger not to occur, Amcor shall
be entitled to the payment of the Bemis Termination Fee (to the extent owed
pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_) together with any costs, fees or expenses
payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(d)_, and to any Damages, to the extent
proven, resulting from or arising out of such Intentional Breach (as reduced

the Amcor Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) other than as contemplated by _Section 9.3_,
except that to the extent any termination of this Agreement resulted from,
directly or indirectly, an Intentional Breach of this Agreement by Amcor, New
Holdco or Merger Sub or such Intentional Breach by Amcor, New Holdco or Merger
Sub shall cause the Scheme Closing or the Merger not to occur, Bemis shall be
entitled to the payment of the Amcor Termination Fee (to the extent owed
pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_), together with any costs, fees or expenses
payable pursuant to _Section 6.13(c)_ or _Section 8.2(d)_, and to any

Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"

"without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall
have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The table of
contents and headings set forth in this Agreement or in the Amcor Disclosure

purposes only and shall not affect or be deemed to affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any term or provision hereof.
When reference is made herein to a Person, such reference shall be deemed to
include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise
indicated or the context otherwise requires. All references herein to the
Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect
Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context
otherwise requires. The Parties agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,

that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against
the Party drafting such agreement or document. The words "hereof", "herein"

refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise. The definitions contained in

thereunder, and any statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement
or instrument referred to herein shall mean (except where expressly noted)
such statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including

phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". With respect to the
determination of any period of time, the word "from" means "from and
including". All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The phrase "ordinary course
of business" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to mean "the ordinary

be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when a
counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered
to the other Parties. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
to this Agreement by facsimile transmission or by e-mail of a .pdf attachment
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this

Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement (including the Bemis Disclosure Letter and the Amcor
Disclosure Letter), and all annexes and exhibits hereto (including the Scheme
and the Deed Poll), constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior
agreements (except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended
hereby so that until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1_, Amcor, New Holdco and Merger Sub shall be permitted to take
the actions contemplated by this Agreement) and understandings, both written
and oral, among the Parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.

 



 

(b) This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person
other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, other than (i) as
provided in _Section 6.4_ (Directors and Officers Insurance and
Indemnification) (which shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties), (ii)
from and after the Effective Time, the right of Bemis Shareholders to receive
the Merger Consideration, and (iii) unless the Effective Time shall have
occurred, the right of Bemis, on behalf of the Bemis Shareholders, to pursue
claims for damages for any breach of this Agreement by Amcor, Merger Sub or
New Holdco that give rise to any such claim (including damages based on loss
of the economic benefits of the Transactions to the Bemis Shareholders,
including loss of premium offered to such Bemis Shareholders) and any damages,
settlements, or other amounts recovered or received by Bemis with respect to
such claims may, in Bemiss sole and absolute discretion, be (A) distributed,
in whole or in part, by Bemis to the holders of Bemis Shares of record as of
any date determined by Bemis; or (B) retained by Bemis for the use and benefit
of Bemis on behalf of its shareholders in any manner Bemis deems fit.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner adverse to any
Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are each fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with, and
any and all claims, controversies, and causes of action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort, or statute,
shall be governed by, the internal laws of the State of Delaware, including
its statutes of limitations, without giving effect to any laws or other rules
that would result in the application of the laws or statutes of limitations of

related thereto shall, solely to the extent required by the Laws of Victoria,
Australia be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
Victoria, Australia, (ii) the Deed Poll shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of Victoria, Australia and (iii) the Merger and the
fiduciary duties of the Bemis Officers and Board of Directors and any

solely to the extent required by the Laws of the State of Missouri, be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Missouri.

 



 

(b) Each Party, with respect to any Proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or relating to, this
Agreement or the Transactions (whether brought by any Party or any of its
affiliates or against any Party or its affiliates), (i) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle
County, Delaware or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal
court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court; (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion
or other request for leave from such court; and (iii) agrees that it will not
bring any such action in any court other than the Court of Chancery for the
State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, Delaware, or, if (and only if)
such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
MERGER AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 9.12_.

 



 

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their permitted successors and
assigns. No Party may assign or delegate, by operation of law or otherwise,
all or any portion of its rights, obligations or liabilities under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties, which any

 



      
 

 



 

such Party may withhold in its absolute discretion; _provided_ that Merger Sub
may assign, in Amcors and its sole discretion and without the consent of
Bemis, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or
more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of New Holdco; _provided_
that no such assignment shall be permitted without the prior written consent
of Bemis if such assignment could reasonably be expected to increase the risk
that any of the Conditions may not be timely satisfied or result in a breach
of any of covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement or adversely
affect Bemis.

 



 

Section 9.14 _Enforcement; Remedies; Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any
provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific
terms or is otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior
to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_, each Party
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a
decree or order of specific performance to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and to any further equitable relief.

 



 

(c) The Parties rights in this _Section 9.14_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section 9.14_ on the basis that there is an adequate
remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at Law or equity. For the avoidance of doubt, each Party agrees
that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a breach of this Agreement by
any Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy referred to in this
_Section 9.14_, such Party shall not be required to obtain, furnish, post or
provide any bond or other security in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any such remedy.

 



 

(d) To the extent any Party brings any Proceeding to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly
available to such Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the End Date
shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such
Proceeding is pending, plus 20 Business Days, or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such Proceeding.

 



 

(e) Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Bemis or Amcor to take
any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the
part of Bemis or Amcor, as applicable, to cause such Subsidiary to take such
action.

 ** _Exhibit A_**

 



 

 **CONDITIONS TO THE SCHEME**

 



 

1. The Scheme will be conditional upon:

 



 

(a) the Amcor Shareholder Approval being duly obtained at the Scheme Meeting
(or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, in each case at which a vote
on such approval was taken); and

 



 

(b) the approval by the Court (or any court of competent jurisdiction on
appeal therefrom) (without material modification) of the Scheme pursuant to
Section 411(4)(b) of the Australian Act (the date on which the condition in
this paragraph 1(b) is satisfied, the " _Sanction Date_ ").

 



 

2. The Parties have agreed that, subject to paragraph 5 of this Exhibit A, the Scheme will also be conditional upon each of the following matters having been satisfied on or before the Sanction Date:

 



 

(a) the Bemis Shareholder Approval being duly obtained at the Bemis Special
Meeting (or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, in each case at which
a vote on such approval was taken);

 



 

(b) (i) the NYSE having approved the listing of the New Holdco Shares to be
issued to the holders of Bemis Shares and the New Holdco Shares underlying the
CDIs to be issued to holders of Amcor Shares pursuant to the Scheme and the
Merger, subject to official notice of issuance, and (ii) ASX having provided
approval for the admission of New Holdco to the official list of ASX and the
approval for official quotation of the CDIs, whether or not such approval is
subject to conditions;

 



 

(c) the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the Scheme shall have expired or been earlier
terminated;

 



 

(d) all required Governmental Consents under the Antitrust Laws of the
jurisdictions set forth in _Exhibit B_ (as the same may be amended with the
written consent of Amcor and Bemis) shall have been obtained and remain in
full force and effect and all applicable waiting periods shall have expired,
lapsed or been terminated (as appropriate);

 



 

(e) the Form S-4 shall have become effective under the Securities Act and
shall not be the subject of any stop order or Proceedings initiated by the SEC
seeking any stop order;

 



 

(f) no Governmental Entity of a competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law or Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and enjoins or otherwise prohibits
or makes illegal consummation of the Merger or the Scheme (it being understood
that if any such Law or Order arises out of or relates to Antitrust Laws, such
Law or Order will only constitute a Condition under this Condition 2(f) to the
extent it would constitute a Material Restraint);

 



      
 

 



 

(g) one of the following has occurred: (i) New Holdco has received written
notice under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) (" _FATA_
"), by or on behalf of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia ("
_Treasurer_ "), advising that the Commonwealth Government of Australia has no
objections to the Scheme, either unconditionally or on conditions that are
acceptable to New Holdco acting reasonably; (ii) the Treasurer becomes
precluded by passage of time from making an order or decision under Part 3 of
the FATA in relation to the Scheme and the Scheme is not prohibited by section
82 of the FATA; or (iii) where an interim order is made under section 68 of
the FATA in respect of the Scheme, the subsequent period for making an order
or decision under Part 3 of the FATA elapses without the Treasurer making such
an order or decision; and

 



 

(h) the Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 



 

3. The Parties have agreed that, subject to paragraph 5 of this Exhibit A, Amcors and New Holdcos obligations to effect the Scheme will also be conditional upon each of the following matters having been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived by Amcor) on or before the Sanction Date:

 



 

(a) (i) The representations and warranties of Bemis set forth in _Section
3.2(a)_, _Section 3.2(b)_, _Section 3.2(c)(i)_, _Section 3.2(c)(iv)_ (only
in respect of securities of Bemis), and _Section 3.2(c)(v)_ shall be true and
correct, subject only to _de minimis_ inaccuracies (A) on the date of this
Agreement and (B) at the Sanction Date as though made on the Sanction Date (in
each case except to the extent that any such representation and warranty
speaks as of a particular date, in which case such representation and warranty
shall be so true and correct as of such date), (ii) the representations and
warranties of Bemis set forth in (x) the first sentence of _Section 3.10(a)_
(Absence of Certain Changes or Events) shall be true and correct in all
respects and (y) _Section 3.3(a)_, _Section 3.16_ and _Section 3.17_ shall
be true and correct in all material respects (in the case of this clause (y),
without any materiality, Bemis Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualification), in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), (A) on the date of
this Agreement and (B) at the Sanction Date as though made on the Sanction
Date (in each case except to the extent that such representation and warranty
speaks as of a particular date, in which case such representation and warranty
shall be so true and correct as of such date); and (iii) the other
representations and warranties of Bemis set forth in _Article III_ shall be
true and correct (A) on the date of this Agreement and (B) at the Sanction
Date as though made on the Sanction Date (in each case except to the extent
that any such representation and warranty speaks as of a particular date, in
which case such representation and warranty shall be so true and correct as of
such date); _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the condition set forth in this paragraph 3(a)(iii) shall be deemed to have
been satisfied even if any representations and warranties of Bemis are not so
true and correct unless the failure of such representations and warranties of
Bemis to be so true and correct (read for purposes of this paragraph 3(a)(iii)
without any materiality, Bemis Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualification), individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a Bemis Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Bemis shall have in all material respects performed the obligations and
complied with the covenants required by the Agreement to be performed or
complied with by it prior to the Sanction Date;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Bemis shall have delivered to Amcor a certificate, dated as of the
Sanction Date and signed by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial
Officer of Bemis, certifying on behalf of Bemis to the effect that the
conditions set forth in paragraphs 3(a) and 3(b) have been satisfied; and

 



 

(d) Amcor shall have received from a "Big 4" accounting firm or nationally
recognized tax counsel (" _Amcor Tax Advisor_ "), an opinion or written advice
dated as of the Sanction Date to the effect that, since the date of this
Agreement, there is no Tax Law Change, the effect of which is to cause the
Merger and the Scheme to fail to qualify, at a "should" (or higher) level of
comfort, for the Intended Tax Treatment (assuming for this purpose that the
Merger and the Scheme would have qualified for the Intended Tax Treatment
prior to the Tax Law Change), it being understood that in rendering such
opinion or written advice, Amcor Tax Advisor may rely upon customary
assumptions and representations; _provided_ , that in the event that Amcor Tax
Advisor is unable to deliver such opinion or written advice, Bemis shall be
entitled to appoint an alternative Bemis Tax Advisor to deliver such opinion
or written advice to Amcor instead.

 



 

4. The Parties have agreed that, subject to paragraph 5 of this Exhibit A, the Scheme will also be conditional upon each of the following matters having been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived by Bemis) on or before the Sanction Date:

 



 

(a) (i) The representations and warranties of Amcor set forth in _Section
4.2(a)_, _Section 4.2(c)(ii)_, _Section 4.2(e)_ (only in respect of
securities of Amcor and New Holdco), and _Section 4.2(f)_ (only in respect of
securities of Amcor and New Holdco) shall be true and correct, subject only to
_de minimis_ inaccuracies, (A) on the date of this Agreement and (B) at the
Sanction Date as though made on the Sanction Date (in each case except to the
extent that any such representation and warranty speaks as of a particular
date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be so true and
correct as of such date); (ii) the representations and warranties of Amcor set
forth in (x) _Section 4.9_ (Absence of Certain Changes and Events) shall be
true and correct in all respects and (y) _Section 4.3(a)_ shall be true and
correct in all material respects (in the case of this clause (y), without any
materiality, Amcor Material Adverse Effect or similar qualification), in the
case of each of clauses (x) and (y), (A) on the date of this Agreement and (B)
at the Sanction Date as though made on the Sanction Date (in each case except
to the extent that any such representation and warranty speaks as of a
particular date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be so
true and correct as of such date); and (iii) the other representations and
warranties of Amcor set forth in _Article IV_ shall be true and correct in
all respects (A) on the date of this Agreement and (B) at the Sanction Date as
though made on the Sanction Date (in each case except to the extent that any
such representation and warranty speaks as of a particular date, in which case
such representation and warranty shall be so true and correct as of such
date); _provided_ that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
condition set forth in this paragraph 4(a)(iii) shall be deemed to have been
satisfied even if any representations and warranties of Amcor are not so true
and correct unless the failure of such representations and warranties to be so
true and correct (read for purposes of this paragraph 4(a)(iii) without any
materiality, Amcor Material Adverse Effect or similar qualification),
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have an Amcor Material Adverse Effect

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each of Amcor, New Holdco and Merger Sub shall have in all material
respects performed the obligations and complied with the covenants required by
the Agreement to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Sanction
Date;

 



 

(c) Amcor shall have delivered to Bemis a certificate, dated as of the
Sanction Date and signed by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial
Officer of Amcor, certifying on behalf of Amcor, New Holdco and Merger Sub to
the effect that the conditions set forth in paragraphs 4(a) and 4(b) have been
satisfied; and

 



 

(d) Bemis shall have received from Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP or
other nationally recognized tax counsel or a "Big 4" accounting firm (" _Bemis
Tax Advisor_ "), an opinion or written advice dated the Sanction Date to the
effect that, since the date of this Agreement, there is no Tax Law Change, the
effect of which is to cause the Merger and the Scheme to fail to qualify, at a
"should" (or higher) level of comfort, for the Intended Tax Treatment
(assuming for this purpose that the Merger and the Scheme would have qualified
for the Intended Tax Treatment prior to the Tax Law Change), it being
understood that in rendering such opinion or written advice, such Bemis Tax
Advisor may rely upon customary assumptions and representations; _provided_ ,
that in the event that Bemis Tax Advisor is unable to deliver such opinion or
written advice, Amcor shall be entitled to appoint an alternative Amcor Tax
Advisor to deliver such opinion or written advice to Bemis instead.

 



 

5.

 



 

(a) Amcor and Bemis reserve the right (but shall be under no obligation) to
waive (to the extent permitted by applicable Law), in whole or in part, all or
any of the conditions in paragraph 2 of this _Exhibit A_ ( _provided_ that
all Parties agree to any such waiver);

 



 

(b) Amcor reserves the right (but shall be under no obligation) to waive, in
whole or in part, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, all or any of the
conditions in paragraph 3; and

share register) by an appropriate authority from the Ineligible Foreign
Shareholder;

amount on trust, but any benefit accruing from the amount will be to the
benefit of New Holdco. An amount credited to the account is to be treated as
having been paid to the Ineligible Foreign Shareholder when credited to the
account. New Holdco must maintain records of the amounts paid, the people who
are entitled to the amounts, and any transfer of the amounts.

 



 

(d) If New Holdco receives professional advice that any withholding or other
tax is required by Law or by a Governmental Entity to be withheld from a
payment to an Ineligible Foreign Shareholder, New Holdco is entitled to
withhold the relevant amount before making the payment to the Ineligible
Foreign Shareholder (and payment of the reduced amount shall be taken to be
full payment of the relevant amount for the purposes of this Scheme, including
clause 5.3(a)(4)). New Holdco must pay any amount so withheld to the relevant
taxation authorities within the time permitted by law, and, if requested in
writing by the relevant Ineligible Foreign Shareholder, provide a receipt or
other appropriate evidence of such payment (or procure the provision of such
receipt or other evidence) to the relevant Ineligible Foreign Shareholder.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Each Ineligible Foreign Shareholder appoints New Holdco as its agent to
receive on its behalf any financial services guide (or similar or equivalent
document) or other notices (including any updates of those documents) that the
Sale Agent is required to provide to Ineligible Foreign Shareholders under the
Corporations Act or any other applicable law.

 



 

(f) Payment of the amount calculated in accordance with clause 5.3(a) to an
Ineligible Foreign Shareholder in accordance with this clause 5.3 satisfies in
full the Ineligible Foreign Shareholders right to Scheme Consideration.

 



 

(g) New Holdco, in complying with the terms of clause 5.3(a) in respect of an
Ineligible Foreign Shareholder, will be taken to have satisfied and discharged
its obligations to the Ineligible Foreign Shareholders under the Scheme. An
Ineligible Foreign Shareholder will have no claim against New Holdco for any
entitlement they would have had to the CDIs but for the terms of this Scheme.

 



 

 **5.4** **Orders of a court or Governmental Entity**

 



 

If written notice is given to Amcor (or the Amcor Registry) or New Holdco (or
the New Holdco registry) of an Order or direction made by a court of competent
jurisdiction or by another Governmental Entity that:

 



 

(a) requires consideration to be provided to a third party (either through
payment of a sum or the issuance of a security) in respect of Scheme Shares
held by a particular Scheme Shareholder, which would otherwise be payable or
required to be issued to that Scheme Shareholder by Amcor or New Holdco in
accordance with this clause 5, then Amcor or New Holdco shall be entitled to
procure that provision of that consideration is made in accordance with that
order or direction; or

 



 

(b) prevents Amcor or New Holdco from providing consideration to any
particular Scheme Shareholder in accordance with this clause 5, or the payment
or issuance of such consideration is otherwise prohibited by applicable law,
Amcor New Holdco shall be entitled to (as applicable) retain an amount, in
Australian dollars, equal to the number of Scheme Shares held by that Scheme
Shareholder multiplied by the Scheme Consideration direct CDN not to issue, or
to issue to a trustee or nominee, the CDIs that Scheme Shareholder would
otherwise be entitled to under clause 5.1,

 



 

until such time as provision of the Scheme Consideration in accordance with
this clause 5 is permitted by that (or another) order or direction or
otherwise by law.

 



 

 **5.5** **Status of New Holdco Shares and CDIs**

 



 

Subject to this Scheme becoming Effective, New Holdco must:

 



 

(a) issue the New Holdco Shares required to be issued by it under this Scheme
on terms such that each such New Holdco Share will rank equally in all
respects with each other such New Holdco Share;

 



 

(b) ensure that each such New Holdco Share is duly and validly issued in
accordance with all applicable laws and New Holdcos memorandum of association
and articles of incorporation, fully paid and free from any mortgage, charge,
lien, encumbrance or other security interest (except for any lien arising
under New Holdcos articles of incorporation);

 



 

(c) take steps to have the CDIs quoted for trading on the ASX in accordance
with the terms of the Transaction Agreement; and

 



      
 

 



 

(d) take steps to have the New Holdco Shares quoted for trading on the NYSE in
accordance with the terms of the Transaction Agreement.

 



 

6 Dealings in Amcor Shares

 



 

 **6.1** **Determination of Scheme Shareholders**

 



 

To establish the identity of the Scheme Shareholders, dealings in Amcor Shares
or other alterations to the Amcor Share Register will only be recognised if:

 



 

(a) in the case of dealings of the type to be effected using CHESS, the
transferee is registered in the Amcor Share Register as the holder of the
relevant Amcor Shares before the Scheme Record Date; and

 



 

(b) in all other cases, registrable transfer or transmission applications in
respect of those dealings, or valid requests in respect of other alterations,
are received before the Scheme Record Date at the place where the Amcor Share
Register is kept,

 



 

and Amcor must not accept for registration, nor recognise for any purpose
(except a transfer to New Holdco pursuant to this Scheme and any subsequent
transfer by New Holdco or its successors in title), any transfer or
transmission application or other request received after such times, or
received prior to such times but not in registrable or actionable form, as
appropriate.

 



 

 **6.2** **Register**

 



 

(a) Amcor must register registrable transmission applications or transfers of
the Scheme Shares in accordance with clause 6.1(b) before the Scheme Record
Date provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this clause 6.2(a)
requires Amcor to register a transfer that would result in an Amcor
Shareholder holding a parcel of Amcor Shares that is less than a marketable
parcel (for the purposes of this clause 6.2(a) marketable parcel has the
meaning given in the Operating Rules).

 



 

(b) If this Scheme becomes Effective, a holder of Scheme Shares (and any
person claiming through that holder) must not dispose of, or purport or agree
to dispose of, any Scheme Shares or any interest in them on or after the
Scheme Record Date otherwise than pursuant to this Scheme, and any attempt to
do so will have no effect and Amcor shall be entitled to disregard any such
disposal.

 



 

(c) For the purpose of determining entitlements to the Scheme Consideration,
Amcor must maintain the Amcor Share Register in accordance with the provisions
of this clause 6.2 until the Scheme Consideration in accordance with clause 5
has been paid to the Scheme Shareholders. The Amcor Share Register in this

Immediately upon the provision of the Scheme Consideration to each Scheme

New Holdco in each such capacity) to appoint any director, officer, secretary

appropriate, corporate representative to attend shareholders meetings,
exercise the votes attaching to the Scheme Shares registered in their name and

be made by the Scheme Shareholder to New Holdco and to be a binding
instruction, notification or election to, and accepted by, New Holdco in
respect of the New Holdco Shares issued to that Scheme Shareholder until that
instruction, notification or election is revoked or amended in writing
addressed to New Holdco at its registry.

 



 

 **8.6** **Binding effect of Scheme**

 



 

This Scheme binds Amcor and all of the Scheme Shareholders (including those
who did not attend the Scheme Meeting to vote on this Scheme, did not vote at
the Scheme Meeting, or voted against this Scheme at the Scheme Meeting) and,

Scheme Shareholder, may sub-delegate its functions, authorities or powers
under this clause 8.7 to all or any of its directors, officers, secretaries or
employees (jointly, severally or jointly and severally).

 **Quorum for General Meetings** : A quorum at any general meeting shall

 **Size of Board:** The Board will consist of 11 members until the date of the
first annual general meeting of shareholders following the Merger Closing,
after which the Board will consist of not less than three or more than 12
members, the exact number of which shall be fixed from time to time by the
Board.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Annual Election** : Directors will be elected for one year terms at each
annual general meeting of shareholders. Directors will be elected by a
majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at
which a quorum is present, provided that if the number of candidates properly
nominated for election exceeds the number of directors to be elected at a
meeting, directors will be elected by a plurality of votes cast at such
meeting.

 



 

 **Removal** : Directors may only be removed by shareholders and shareholders
may only remove directors for cause.

counted in the quorum of any Board meeting at which the conflicted transaction
is considered, but cannot cast a vote in respect of the matter.

 



 

 ** _4\. Other_**

 



 

 **Disclosure of Interests** : To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
law, New Holdco may, by written notice, require any person who New Holdco has
reasonable cause to believe to be interested in Ordinary Shares or to have
previously been so interested to disclose details of that interest.

 



 

 **Indemnification of Directors and Officers** : To the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law, every present or former director or officer of
New Holdco shall be indemnified by New Holdco against any loss or liability
incurred by him by reason of being or having been such a director or officer.
The Board may authorize the purchase or maintenance by New Holdco for any
current or former director or officer of such insurance as is permitted by
applicable law in respect of any liability which would otherwise attach to
such current or former director or officer.

 



 

 **Freeze-Out Provision** : New Holdco will prohibited from engaging in any
business combination with any "interested shareholder" for a period of three
years following the time that such shareholder became an interested
shareholder (subject to certain specified exceptions), unless (in addition to
other exceptions) prior to such business combination the Board approved either
the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the shareholder
becoming an "interested shareholder." An "interested shareholder" is (subject
to certain specified exceptions) any person (together with its affiliates and
associates) that (i) owns more than 15% of New Holdcos voting stock or (ii)
is an affiliate or associate of New Holdco and owned more than 15% of New
Holdcos voting stock within three years of the date on which it is sought to
