AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the " _Agreement_ ") is made and
entered into as of May 19, 2017, between UNION BANKSHARES CORPORATION, a
Virginia corporation (" _UBSH_ "), and XENITH BANKSHARES, INC., a Virginia
corporation (" _XBKS_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of UBSH and XBKS have approved, and deem it
advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders to
consummate, the business combination transaction provided for herein in which
XBKS will merge with and into UBSH (the " _Merger_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of UBSH and XBKS have each determined that
the Merger is consistent with and will further their respective business
strategies and goals; and

  



  

WHEREAS, as an inducement for each party to enter into this Agreement,
certain shareholders of each of UBSH and XBKS have simultaneously herewith
entered into voting agreements in connection with the Merger; and

  



  

WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that, for federal income tax
purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), and the Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code
(and any future amendments to such regulations and any corresponding
provisions of succeeding regulations) (the "Treasury Regulations"), and that
this Agreement shall constitute, and is adopted as, a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for purposes
of Sections 354, 356 and 361 of the Code (and any comparable provision of
state law) for federal and applicable state income tax purposes.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE 1 
 The merger and related matters

  



  

Section 1.1 The Merger.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with
the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (the " _VSCA_ "), at the Effective Time
(as defined in _Section 1.3_ ), XBKS will be merged with and into UBSH
pursuant to the Plan of Merger, substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit 1.1_ and made a part hereof (the " _Plan of Merger_ "). The
separate corporate existence of XBKS thereupon shall cease, and UBSH will be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (UBSH is referred to herein as the "
_Continuing Corporation_ " whenever reference is made to it as of the
Effective Time or thereafter). The Merger will have the effect set forth in
Section 13.1-721 of the VSCA.

  



    

 | 1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 1.2 Closing.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. at the offices of
Troutman Sanders LLP, 1001 Haxall Point, Richmond, Virginia on a date, which
date shall be no later than three (3) business days following the
satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of
the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature only can be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless accelerated or extended as both
parties may agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ "). All documents required
by this Agreement to be delivered at or prior to the Closing Date will be
exchanged by the parties at the Closing.

  



  

Section 1.3 Effective Time.

  



  

On the Closing Date, UBSH and XBKS will execute and file articles of merger
meeting the requirements of Section 13.1-720 of the VSCA, including
containing the Plan of Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), with the
Virginia State Corporation Commission (the " _SCC_ "). The Merger shall
become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger is issued by the SCC
(or at such later time as may be specified by mutual agreement of the parties
in the Articles of Merger), as provided in Sections 13.1-720 and 13.1-606 of
the VSCA (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ "). Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Article 6_ , the parties will use their reasonable best efforts
to cause the Effective Time to occur at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on January 1,
2018, and the parties agree that in no event shall the Effective Time occur on
a date before January 1, 2018. Notwithstanding that the Closing Date may
occur prior to the date of the Effective Time, the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the Merger shall not be effective until the occurrence of the
Effective Time.

  



  

Section 1.4 Corporate Governance and Related Matters.

  



  

On or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of UBSH shall cause
two (2) directors of XBKS (the " _XBKS Directors_ ") to be appointed as
directors of the Continuing Corporation as of the Effective Time to serve
until the next annual meeting of the shareholders of the Continuing
Corporation following the Effective Time. The XBKS Directors shall be chosen
by mutual agreement of UBSH and XBKS. Subject to compliance by the Board of
Directors of the Continuing Corporation with its fiduciary duties (including
compliance with the Continuing Corporation's Organizational Documents and
Corporate Governance Guidelines), the Continuing Corporation shall nominate
each XBKS Director for reelection to the Board of Directors of the Continuing
Corporation at the first annual meeting of the shareholders of the Continuing
Corporation following the Effective Time, and the Continuing Corporation's
proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting shall include the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Continuing Corporation
that its shareholders vote to reelect each XBKS Director to the same extent
as recommendations are made with respect to other directors on the Board of
Directors of the Continuing Corporation.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 1.5 Banking Operations.

  



  

(a) After the Effective Time, Xenith Bank, Richmond, Virginia ("
_Xenith Bank_ "), the wholly owned subsidiary of XBKS, shall merge with and
into Union Bank and Trust, Richmond, Virginia (" _Union Bank_ "), the wholly
owned subsidiary of UBSH (the " _Bank Merger_ "), pursuant to the terms and
conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger substantially in the form
attached as _Exhibit 1.5(a)_ (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ ") and the
separate existence of Xenith Bank shall cease and Union Bank shall survive
and continue to exist as a bank incorporated and chartered under the laws of
the Commonwealth of Virginia. UBSH may at any time change the method or
timing of effecting the combination of Xenith Bank and Union Bank if and to
the extent UBSH deems such changes necessary, appropriate or desirable for any
reason in its discretion (including, without limitation, to ensure that the
Merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code);  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of Merger Consideration (as defined herein), (ii)
adversely affect the ability of the Merger to quality as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (iii) materially impede or
delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iv)
result in the Bank Merger occurring prior to the Merger of XBKS and UBSH; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that (x) UBSH shall provide XBKS with five days'
prior written notice of such change and the reasons therefor, and (y) UBSH
shall not make any change that would materially affect the tax consequences
to XBKS or its shareholders without the prior written consent of XBKS (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(b) On or prior to the effective time of the Bank Merger, UBSH as
the sole shareholder of Union Bank shall cause the XBKS Directors to be
appointed as directors of Union Bank as of the effective time of the Bank
Merger to serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders of Union
Bank following the Effective Time. Provided that each XBKS Director continues
to be eligible to serve as a director of UBSH, and subject to compliance by
the Board of Directors of Union Bank with its fiduciary duties (including
compliance with Union Bank's Organizational Documents and Corporate
Governance Guidelines) Union Bank shall nominate each XBKS Director for
reelection to the Board of Directors of Union Bank at the first annual meeting
of the shareholder of Union Bank following the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 1.6 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Continuing
Corporation.

  



  

As of the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of UBSH,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the Articles
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Continuing Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable law.

  



  

Section 1.7 Tax Consequences.

  



  

It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and that this Agreement shall constitute
a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
for purposes of Sections 354, 356 and 361 of the Code (and any comparable
provision of state law) for federal and applicable state income tax purposes.
XBKS and UBSH shall prepare and file with each of their respective Tax Returns
all information required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-3 and related
provisions of the Treasury Regulations in a manner consistent with treating
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a reorganization described
in Section 368(a) of the Code and shall take no position (whether in audits,
Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with this treatment unless
required to do so by applicable law.

Section 1.8 Appraisal Rights.

  



  

In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA, no appraisal rights shall be

Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

the Continuing Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

  



  

(b) All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of XBKS

held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third
parties) (any such shares, the " _XBKS Cancelled Shares_ ") shall no longer
be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) Each share of XBKS Common Stock, except for XBKS Cancelled
Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will cease to be outstanding and will be converted automatically into and
exchanged for the right to receive 0.9354 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ")
of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par
value $1.33 per share, of the Continuing Corporation (" _Continuing
Corporation Common Stock_ ") (with respect to a given share of XBKS Common
Stock, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.6_ , the " _Merger
Consideration_ "); it being understood that upon the Effective Time, pursuant
to _Section 2.1(a)_ , UBSH Common Stock, including the shares issued to
former holders of XBKS Common Stock, shall be the Continuing Corporation
Common Stock.

or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar change in
capitalization, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made to
the Exchange Ratio, and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, UBSH shall for the benefit of
holders of shares of XBKS Common Stock and the holders of XBKS Stock Options,
XBKS Restricted Stock Awards, XBKS RSU Awards and the XBKS Warrants
(collectively, " _XBKS Equity Awards_ ") and for exchange in accordance with
this _Article 2_ , (i) deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent an amount of cash sufficient to pay (A) the cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock and (B) the cash
payable with respect to the XBKS Equity Awards (such cash deposited pursuant
to this clause (i), the " _Exchange Fund_ "), and (ii) evidence of shares in
book-entry form, representing the shares of the Continuing Corporation Common
Stock to be issued and paid pursuant to this _Article 2_.

  



  

(c) _Letter of Transmittal_. UBSH shall prepare appropriate and
customary transmittal materials on which UBSH and XBKS shall mutually
agree (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). The Letter of Transmittal shall
specify that delivery of the Letter of Transmittal and, as applicable, title
and risk of loss with respect to (i) an outstanding Certificate or outstanding
Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represent
outstanding shares of XBKS Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ "), and
(ii) uncertificated shares of XBKS Common Stock represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case other than XBKS Cancelled Shares, shall
be effected only upon proper delivery of the completed Letter of Transmittal
and, as applicable and subject to _Section 2.3(d)_ , the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent. UBSH shall make
available and mail the Letter of Transmittal not more than five (5) business
days after the Effective Time to all persons who were record holders of
shares of XBKS Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and use
its reasonable best efforts to make the Letter of Transmittal available to
any such shareholder who requests such Letter of Transmittal.

  



  

Section 2.3 Exchange of Shares.

  



  

(a) Each holder of an outstanding share of XBKS Common Stock who has
properly surrendered such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent (or has complied with _Section 2.3(d)_ ), together with a Letter of
Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documentation as the Exchange Agent and
UBSH may reasonably require, shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect to such share of XBKS Common Stock in accordance
with _Section 2.3(b)_.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Whenever a holder of an outstanding share of XBKS Common Stock
shall become entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.3(a)_ , in addition to the rights of such holder set forth in
_Section 2.4_ , any such holder shall be entitled to receive:

  



  

(i) evidence of issuance in book-entry form the number of whole
shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which the aggregate
number of shares of XBKS Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement; and

  



  

(ii) the amount of cash, if any, into which the aggregate number of
shares of XBKS Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to _Section
2.6_ of this Agreement.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, the Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to
deliver the Merger Consideration to which any holder of XBKS Common Stock is
entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders his, her or
its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, or otherwise complies with
_Section 2.3(d)_ , for exchange as provided in _Section 2.3(a)_. Whenever a
holder of an outstanding share of XBKS Common Stock shall become entitled to
receive any Merger Consideration, the Continuing Corporation shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to deliver such Merger
Consideration to such holder within two (2) business days thereafter.

  



  

(c) _Abandoned Property._ Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, neither the Continuing Corporation nor the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to a holder of XBKS Common Stock for any amounts paid
or property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property law.

  



  

(d) _Lost Certificates_. A holder of XBKS Common Stock whose
Certificates have been lost, destroyed, stolen or are otherwise missing
shall be entitled to receive its portion of the Merger Consideration and
dividends or distributions to which such shareholder shall be entitled, if
any, upon compliance with reasonable conditions imposed by the Continuing
Corporation and the Exchange Agent pursuant to applicable law and as required
in accordance with the Continuing Corporation's and the Exchange Agent's
standard policy (including the requirement that the shareholder furnish an
affidavit of lost certificate, surety bond or other customary indemnity).

  



  

(e) _Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Continuing Corporation;
_provided_ , that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
Merger Consideration, and the Continuing Corporation shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of XBKS
Common Stock or XBKS Equity Awards in the amount of any such losses to the
extent necessary for payment of the cash portion of the Merger Consideration.
Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
the Continuing Corporation or as directed by the Continuing Corporation. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the former holders of XBKS Common Stock or
XBKS Equity Awards for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, to
the extent permitted by law, be paid to the Continuing Corporation. Any
former holder of XBKS Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article 2_ shall thereafter look only to the Continuing Corporation for
payment of the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on Continuing Corporation Common Stock deliverable in respect
of each former share of XBKS Common Stock such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon.

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) _Rounding_. All dollar amounts payable to any registered holder
of XBKS Common Stock pursuant to this _Article 2_ shall be rounded to the
nearest whole cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward), based on the
aggregate amount payable for all shares of XBKS Common Stock registered in
such shareholder's name.

  



  

Section 2.4 Rights of Former Holders of XBKS Common Stock.

  



  

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of XBKS shall be closed as to
holders of XBKS Common Stock, and no transfer of XBKS Common Stock by
any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for
exchange in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.3(a)_ , each Book-
Entry Share or Certificate shall from and after the Effective Time represent
for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration in exchange therefor. To the extent permitted by law,
former holders of record of XBKS Common Stock shall be entitled to vote after
the Effective Time at any meeting of Continuing Corporation shareholders the
number of whole shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which their
respective shares of XBKS Common Stock are converted, regardless of whether
such holders have surrendered their Book-Entry Shares or Certificates for
exchange as provided in _Section 2.3(a)_ , but beginning thirty (30) days
after the Effective Time, no such holder shall be entitled to vote on any
matter until such holder surrenders such Certificate or Book-Entry Share for
exchange as provided in _Section 2.3(a)_. Whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by the Continuing Corporation on Continuing
Corporation Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other distributions
on all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but no dividend or other
distribution payable to the holders of record of XBKS Common Stock, if any, as
of any time subsequent to the Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder
of any Book-Entry Share or Certificate issued and outstanding at the
Effective Time until such holder surrenders such Book-Entry Share or
Certificate for exchange as provided in _Section 2.3(a)_. However, upon
surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate representing XBKS Common
Stock, the Merger Consideration, together with all such undelivered dividends
or other distributions without interest, shall be delivered and paid with
respect to each Book-Entry Share or other share represented by such
Certificate.

  



  

Section 2.5 XBKS Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

  



  

(a) _Section 2.5(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter of XBKS lists all of
the equity or equity-based compensation plans maintained by XBKS under which
awards are currently outstanding or any awards may be made thereunder
(collectively, a " _XBKS Stock Plan_ "). At the Effective Time, each option
to purchase shares of XBKS Common Stock (an " _XBKS Stock Option_ ")
granted under an XBKS Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease, at the Effective Time, to represent a right to acquire XBKS Common
Stock and shall be automatically converted at the Effective Time without any
action on the part of the holder thereof into the right to receive a cash
payment in an amount equal to the product of (i) the difference between (A)
the product of the average of the closing sale prices of UBSH Common Stock
on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the ten (10) full trading days ending
on the trading day immediately preceding (but not including) the Effective
Time and the Exchange Ratio (the " _Conversion Price_ ") and (b) the per share
exercise price of the XBKS Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (B) the number of shares of XBKS Common Stock subject to such
XBKS Stock Option, subject to any applicable withholdings authorized by
_Section 2.8_. If the exercise price of an XBKS Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time is greater than the Conversion Price, then at the
Effective Time such XBKS Stock Option shall be cancelled without any payment
made in exchange therefor.

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock award granted under
an XBKS Stock Plan, which is unvested or contingent and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (an " _XBKS Restricted
Stock Award_ "), shall vest fully and shall be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect
of each share of XBKS Common Stock underlying such XBKS Restricted Stock
Award, and the shares of XBKS Common Stock subject to such XBKS Restricted
Stock Award will be treated in the same manner as all other shares of XBKS
Common Stock for such purposes.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in
respect of shares of XBKS Common Stock that is outstanding and
unsettled, unvested or contingent immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
" _XBKS RSU Award_ ") shall vest fully and shall be converted into the right
to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
this Agreement in respect of each share of XBKS Common Stock underlying such
XBKS RSU Award.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, XBKS shall take all actions
necessary to cause each XBKS Stock Plan to terminate effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the consummation of the
Merger.

  



  

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
XBKS or a committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions
of this _Section 2.5_, including, but not limited to, delivering written
notice (in form reasonably approved by UBSH) to each holder of an XBKS Stock
Option, XBKS Restricted Stock Award, or XBKS RSU Award of the treatment of
such award pursuant to this _Section 2.5_.

  



  

Section 2.6 No Fractional Shares.

  



  

Each holder of shares of XBKS Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger
which would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Continuing Corporation Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock multiplied
by the product of (i) the average of the closing sale prices of UBSH Common
Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the ten (10) full trading days
ending on the trading day immediately preceding (but not including) the
Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

Section 2.7 XBKS Warrants.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase shares of XBKS
Common Stock (an " _XBKS Warrant_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease, at the Effective Time, to
represent a right to acquire XBKS Common Stock and shall be automatically
converted at the Effective Time without any action on the part of the holder
thereof into the right to purchase shares of Continuing Corporation Common
Stock upon exercise of such XBKS Warrant, with the exercise price of each
share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock subject to such XBKS Warrant and
the number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock subject to such
XBKS Warrant determined as provided below:

  



  

(i) the number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock to
be subject to the XBKS Warrant shall be equal to the product of the number of
shares of XBKS Common Stock subject to the XBKS Warrant immediately prior to
the Effective Time and the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional
shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share; and

  



  

(ii) the exercise price per share of Continuing Corporation Common
Stock under the XBKS Warrant shall be equal to the exercise price per share
of Continuing Corporation Common Stock under the XBKS Warrant immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that if
the exercise price resulting from such division includes a fractional cent,
the exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.

  



  

(b) XBKS, in consultation with UBSH, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to repurchase the XBKS Warrant originally issued pursuant to
the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program and held by the
U.S. Department of the Treasury prior to or concurrent with the Effective
Time (the " _Warrant Purchase_ "). The method of funding the Warrant Purchase
shall be mutually agreed to by XBKS and UBSH.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, XBKS and UBSH shall take all other
actions necessary to give effect to this _Section 2.7_.

  



  

Section 2.8 Withholding Rights.

  



  

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person
such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax (as defined herein) law. The Continuing Corporation will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable by it pursuant to
_Article 2_ of this Agreement to any person such amounts, if any, as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax (as defined
herein) law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to
the appropriate Governmental Authority by the Exchange Agent or by the
Continuing Corporation, such amounts withheld will be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to such person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or the
Continuing Corporation, respectively.

party has delivered to the other party a letter (its " _Disclosure Letter_ ")
setting forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary

party's representations or warranties contained in _Section 3.3_ , or to one
or more of its covenants or agreements contained in _Article 4_ or  _Article
5_ , or as required pursuant to _Article 6_ ; provided, that (i) no such item
is required to be set forth in a party's Disclosure Letter as an exception to
any representation or warranty of such party if its absence would not
result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect under the standard established by _Section 3.2_ , and (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in a party's Disclosure Letter as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by that party
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
(as defined herein) with respect to such party.

  



  

(b) Any disclosures made with respect to a subsection of _Section
3.3_ shall be deemed to qualify (i) any subsections of _Section 3.3_
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (ii) other subsections of
_Section 3.3_ to the extent it is reasonably apparent (notwithstanding the
absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that
such disclosure (x) applies to such other subsections and (y) contains
sufficient detail to enable a reasonable person to recognize the relevance of
such disclosure to such other subsections.

incorrect, including for purposes of _Section 6.2(a)_ and _Section 6.3(a)_

as a consequence of the existence or absence of any fact, event or
circumstance unless such fact, event or circumstance, individually or taken
together with all other facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any
representation or warranty contained in _Section 3.3_ has had or is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on such party (it being understood
that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and
warranties, all materiality and "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and

(a) _Organization, Standing and Power_. It is a Virginia
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of Virginia. It has the corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now conducted and to own, lease and operate its assets,
properties and business. It is duly registered as a bank holding company
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. It is duly licensed
or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of any provision of the Organizational Documents or such articles
or certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) of such Subsidiary, as applicable. True and complete copies of its
Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or other similar governing instruments (the
" _Organizational Documents_ "), in each case as amended to the date hereof
and as in full force and effect as of the date hereof have been made
available to the other party.

corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and to
own, lease and operate its assets, properties and business, and (iii) is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The outstanding shares of capital stock
or equity interests of each of its Subsidiaries are validly issued and
outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable and all such shares or equity
interests are directly or indirectly owned by it free and clear of all liens,
claims and encumbrances or preemptive rights of any person. No rights are
authorized, issued or outstanding with respect to the capital stock or equity
interests of any of its Subsidiaries and there are no agreements,
understandings or commitments relating to the right to vote or to dispose of
the capital stock or equity interests of any of its Subsidiaries. There are
no restrictions on the ability of any of its Subsidiaries to pay dividends or
distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity,
for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all
such regulated entities. The deposits of each of its Subsidiaries that is a
commercial bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") to the maximum extent
permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in
connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the
termination of such insurance are pending or threatened. A true and complete
list of its direct and indirect Subsidiaries as of the date hereof is set
forth in _Section 3.3(b)_ of its Disclosure Letter that shows each
Subsidiary's jurisdiction of incorporation, each jurisdiction in which each
Subsidiary is qualified and/or licensed to do business, its form of
organization (corporate, partnership, joint venture), and lists the owner(s)
and percentage ownership (direct or indirect) of each Subsidiary.

unincorporated, at least a majority of the securities or other interests of
which that have by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of
the board of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to
such corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such party or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries.

other party, this Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation,

rights of creditors or by general principles of equity. UBSH represents and
warrants that the Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger, when issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

  



  

(iii) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by it, nor
the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by it with any of the provisions hereof will: (A) conflict with,
violate or result in a breach or default of any provision of
its Organizational Documents; (B) constitute or result in the breach of any
term, condition or provision of, or constitute a default under, or give rise
to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration with respect to, or
result in the creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon, any property
or asset of it or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any (1) note, bond,
mortgage or indenture, or (2) any material license, agreement or other
instrument or obligation, to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or by which it or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets
may be bound; or (C) subject to the receipt of all required regulatory and

(iii) It and each of its Subsidiaries has devised and maintains a
system of "internal controls over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules

management's general or specific authorizations; (B) transactions are recorded

as such party or other criteria applicable to such financial statements, and

and its Subsidiaries' properties and assets is permitted only in accordance

SEC's rules and forms, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to its management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer required under the Exchange Act
with respect to such reports. It has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to its auditors and the audit committee
of its Board of Directors and on _Section 3.3(f)(iv)_ of its Disclosure

made in writing by management to its auditors and the audit committee of its
Board of Directors and a copy has previously been made available to the other
party. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and

required to be filed pursuant to the laws of the United States, any state or
any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable
in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such Bank Report or
to pay such fees and assessments, would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it. Any
such Bank Report regarding it or any of its Subsidiaries filed with or
otherwise submitted to any Regulatory Agency complied in all material
respects with relevant legal requirements, including as to content. Except for
normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course
of its and its Subsidiaries business, there is no pending proceeding before,
or, to its Knowledge, examination or investigation by, any Regulatory Agency
into the business or operations of it or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no

by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency with respect to
the business, operations, policies or procedures of it or any of its

payment, right or other benefit to any current or former employee, leased
employee, independent contractor, officer, director or other service provider
of it or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) result in any (1) requirement to

merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Benefit Plan or
related trust. It has previously delivered to the other party its preliminary

individuals identified in _Section 5.8(e)_ of its Disclosure Letter
(whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by it or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in
conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and to its Knowledge and
subject to the assumptions and methods described or set forth in those
materials, such estimates are true, correct and complete. With respect to
individuals who are not identified in _Section 5.8(e)_ of its Disclosure
Letter neither it nor its Subsidiaries are required to make any payments or
provide any benefits that will be an "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code. In addition to the foregoing, except as
otherwise set forth in _Section 3.3(o)(ix)_ of its Disclosure Letter, no

deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code. Except as set forth in
_Section 3.3(o)(ix)_ of its Disclosure Letter, no Benefit Plan maintained by

Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code, or otherwise.

benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA that is not
qualified under Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code is exempt from Parts 2,

(xii) Each Benefit Plan of it and its Subsidiaries that is a health or
welfare plan has terms that are in compliance with and has been
administered in accordance with the requirements of the ACA. It and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all respects with the requirements of Section
4980H of the Code so as to avoid the imposition of any taxes or assessable
payments thereunder. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability
or obligation to provide postretirement health, medical or life insurance
benefits to any employees or former employees, leased employees, independent
contractors, officers, or directors, or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof, except as otherwise required under state or federal benefits
continuation laws. In the case of any such required continuation
coverage, except as set forth in _Section 3.3(o)(xii)_ of its Disclosure
Letter, the covered individual is required to pay the full cost of coverage.
No tax under Code Sections 4980B, 4980H or 5000 has been incurred with respect
to any Benefit Plan and to its Knowledge no circumstance exists which could
give rise to such tax.

respects with applicable laws and regulations, and each UBSH Benefit Plan has
been administered in accordance with its terms and applicable laws and

(iv) Each UBSH Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal
Revenue Service to be so qualified, as reflected in a current favorable
determination letter or is maintained under a prototype or volume submitter

applicable issued by the Internal Revenue Service, or a filing for the same
has been made with the Internal Revenue Service seeking such a determination
letter and that request is still awaiting decision by the Internal Revenue
Service (based on Internal Revenue Service permitted determination

has no reason to believe that existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as

negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an unsolicited, bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal with respect to such party (that did not result
from a material breach of this _Section 5.5_ ) if (i) such party's board of

result in a violation of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under
applicable law, (ii) before furnishing any confidential or nonpublic
information, such party receives from such person or entity an executed

of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries
whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of
the consolidated assets of the party. Solely for purposes of _Section 7.4(a)_
, all references to "20% or more" in such definition shall be deemed to be
references to "50% or more."

  



  

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means
an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a person or
entity (or group of persons or entities acting in concert within the meaning
of Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) that the Board of Directors of XBKS or
UBSH, as the case may be, concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial and legal advisors, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition
Proposal, including the likelihood of obtaining financing, and including the
terms and conditions of this Agreement (as it may be proposed in writing to
be amended by XBKS or UBSH, as applicable) would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable to the shareholders of XBKS or UBSH, as
the case may be, from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (as it may be proposed in writing to be
amended by XBKS or UBSH, as applicable); provided that, for purposes of this
definition of "Superior Proposal," "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in _Section 5.5(c)_ , except the reference to
"20% or more" in such definition shall be deemed to be a reference to "50% or
more" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to a
transaction involving UBSH or XBKS or one of their respective banking
Subsidiaries.

(e) Except as provided in _Section 5.5(f)_ , neither the Board of
Directors of XBKS, the Board of Directors of UBSH, nor, in each case, any
committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to
the other party, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify in any
manner adverse to the other party, the approval or recommendation of the Board
of Directors of XBKS or UBSH, as applicable, or any such committee thereof
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (a "
_Change in XBKS Recommendation_ " or a " _Change in UBSH Recommendation_ ,"
respectively).

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Board of Directors of XBKS or UBSH, as applicable, may either:

  



  

(i) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ or
_Section 7.1(j)_ , as the case may be, and enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal provided that such party shall
pay the Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to _Section 7.4(b)_ or
_Section 7.4(c)_ , as the case may be; or

  



  

(ii) make a Change in XBKS Recommendation or a Change in UBSH
Recommendation, as applicable,

  



  

(iii) if and only if in the case of both clause (i) and (ii) above,
(A) an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (that did not
result from a breach of this _Section 5.5_ ) is made to XBKS or UBSH, as
applicable, by a third party, and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn,
(B) the Board of Directors of XBKS or UBSH, as applicable, has concluded in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C)
the Board of Directors of XBKS or UBSH, as applicable, have concluded in good
faith (after consultation with their outside legal counsel) that failure to
do so would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties to its shareholders under applicable law, (D) five (5) business days
shall have elapsed since the party proposing to take such action has given
written notice to the other party advising such other party that the
notifying party intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable
detail the reasons therefor, including, the terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action (a " _Notice of
Change_ ") (it being understood that any amendment to any material term of
such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Notice of Change, except that,
in such case, the five (5) business day period referred to in this
_clause (D)_ and in _clauses (E)_ and _(F)_ shall be reduced to three (3)
business days following the giving of such new Notice of Change), (E) during
such five (5) business day period, the notifying party has considered and, at
the reasonable request of the other party, engaged in good faith discussions
with such party regarding, any adjustment or modification of the terms of
this Agreement proposed in writing by the other party, and (F) the board of
directors of the party proposing to take such action, following such five (5)
business day period, again reasonably determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, and
taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by the other party by the conclusion of such
five (5) business day period) that such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties to its shareholders under applicable law.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit XBKS, UBSH or
their respective Boards of Directors or any committee thereof from at any
time taking and disclosing to XBKS's or UBSH's shareholders, as applicable, a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a), or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided that any such
disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change in XBKS Recommendation or a Change
in UBSH Recommendation, as applicable, unless the Board of Directors
reaffirms the XBKS Board Recommendation, in the case of XBKS, or the UBSH
Board Recommendation, in the case of UBSH, in such statement
without qualification, and shall have the consequences provided for in this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.6 Applications and Consents.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their reasonable best
efforts to prepare as promptly as possible all documentation, to effect all
filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
each Regulatory Agency or Governmental Authority and all third parties
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Regulatory Approvals_ ") and will make all necessary filings, including
supplemental responses thereto, in respect of the Regulatory Approvals as soon
as practicable.

  



  

(b) Each party hereto will promptly furnish to the other party
copies of applications filed with all Regulatory Agencies or
Governmental Authorities and copies of written communications received by
such party from any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Authority with respect

other party with respect to the obtaining of all Regulatory Approvals and
other material consents from third parties advisable to consummate the

other party apprised of the status of material matters relating to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. All documents that the
parties or their respective Subsidiaries are responsible for filing with any
Regulatory Agency or Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (including to obtain Regulatory Approvals)
will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of
applicable law.

  



  

Section 5.7 Public Announcements.

  



  

Prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto will consult with each other
as to the form and substance of any press release or other public
statement materially related to this Agreement prior to issuing such press
release or public statement or making any other public disclosure related
thereto (including any broad based employee communication that is reasonably
likely to become the subject of public disclosure); provided, that nothing in
this _Section 5.7_ or _Section 5.5_ shall prohibit any party from making any
disclosure necessary in order to satisfy such party's disclosure obligations
imposed by applicable law or the rules established by the NASDAQ Stock Market
or any other self-regulatory organization.

Section 5.8 Employee Benefit Plans.

  



  

(a) As of the Effective Time and for a period of one year
thereafter, the Continuing Corporation shall provide to employees of XBKS
and its Subsidiaries, who after the Effective Time become employees of the
Continuing Corporation or its Subsidiaries (" _XBKS Continuing Employees_ ")
(i) base salary or wages that are comparable to the base salary or wages
provided to similarly situated employees of the Continuing Corporation and
its Subsidiaries; (ii) incentive compensation opportunities that are
comparable to the incentive compensation opportunities provided to similarly
situated employees of the Continuing Corporation and its Subsidiaries and
(iii) employee benefits which are, in the aggregate, comparable to the
employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of the Continuing
Corporation and its Subsidiaries; provided that the Continuing Corporation may
provide such benefits to XBKS Continuing Employees under the Benefit Plans of
XBKS or a Subsidiary, under benefit plans maintained by the Continuing
Corporation (" _Continuing Corporation Plans_ ") or by a combination thereof.

  



  

(b) For purposes of eligibility and participation, but not benefit
accrual, service with or credited by XBKS or any of its
Subsidiaries (including service with any predecessor of XBKS or any of its
Subsidiaries) shall be treated as service with the Continuing
Corporation. For purposes of vacation and sick leave under the Union Time
Away From Work Policy (" _Union PTO Policy_ "), XBKS Continuing Employees
will receive benefit credit for prior service and will be eligible to
rollover, for short-term disability leave only, into the "PTOR" subaccount of
the Union PTO Policy, up to a maximum of 40 hours of unused amounts that were
carried over from the prior year under XBKS's paid time off policy.

  



  

(c) To the extent permitted under applicable law, the Continuing
Corporation shall cause welfare Continuing Corporation Plans that cover the
XBKS Continuing Employees after the Effective Time to (i) waive any waiting
period and restrictions and limitations for preexisting conditions or
insurability (except for pre-existing conditions that were excluded, or
restrictions or limitations that were applicable, under the corresponding
Benefit Plans of XBKS or a Subsidiary), and (ii) cause any deductible, co-
insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the XBKS Continuing
Employees under welfare Benefit Plans maintained by XBKS to be credited to
such XBKS Continuing Employees under welfare Continuing Corporation Plans, so
as to reduce the amount of any deductible, co-insurance, or maximum out-of-
pocket payments payable by such XBKS Continuing Employees under welfare
Continuing Corporation Plans.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, XBKS shall vest one hundred percent
all accrued benefits for affected participants under the Virginia
Bankers Association Master Defined Contribution Plan for Xenith Bankshares
(the " _XBKS 401(k) Plan_ "), effective on and subject to the consummation of
the Merger. On or within four months following the Effective Time, UBSH shall
cause the XBKS 401(k) Plan to be merged into the 401(k) plan maintained by
UBSH (the " _UBSH 401(k) Plan_ " and together with the XBKS 401(k) Plan, each
a " _401(k) Plan_ "). Each party agrees to amend its 401(k) Plan to the extent
necessary to ensure that there is no duplication of participation or benefits
under the 401(k) Plans and XBKS agrees to amend its 401(k) Plan
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, to provide that no
additional amounts under the XBKS 401(k) Plan may be invested in the XBKS
stock fund under the XBKS 401(k) Plan on or after the Effective Time. No XBKS
Continuing Employee shall be eligible to participate in the 2017 UBSH/Union
Bank profit sharing program, which amounts are (if any) payable in 2018.

  



    

 | 44| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) All employees of XBKS or a Subsidiary with employment agreements
are listed in _Section 5.8(e)_ of the XBKS Disclosure Letter and XBKS and
UBSH agree that _Section 5.8(e)_ of the XBKS Disclosure Letter shall apply to
such employees. UBSH will decide prior to the Effective Time which of those
employees will receive an offer of employment with the Continuing Corporation.
Any such employee who receives and accepts an offer of employment will be
employed by the Continuing Corporation or a Subsidiary as an at-will employee
and pursuant to terms established by the Continuing Corporation and will be an
XBKS Continuing Employee. Any such XBKS Continuing Employee shall be
eligible, immediately following the Effective Time, to become a participant in
a Continuing Corporation severance plan, which plan shall be determined based
on his or her position and shall be similar to the plan applicable to
similarly situated employees of the Continuing Corporation.

  



  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, UBSH and XBKS shall consult with
respect to how benefits will be provided to the XBKS Continuing Employees, 
_e.g._ , by continued participation in the Benefit Plans of XBKS or a
Subsidiary, by participation in Continuing Corporation Plans or a combination
thereof. In consultation with UBSH, XBKS shall terminate any Benefit Plan of
XBKS or a Subsidiary (other than the XBKS 401(k) Plan), in accordance with
applicable law and effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, if the
XBKS Continuing Employees will become eligible to participate in the
corresponding Continuing Corporation Plan at the Effective Time, and pay any
benefits due thereunder in accordance with the terms of any such plan.

  



  

(g) Nothing in this _Section 5.8_ shall be construed to limit the
right of the Continuing Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, from and
after the Effective Time, to amend or terminate any of the benefit plans
maintained by UBSH or XBKS or their respective Subsidiaries before the
Effective Time to the extent that such benefit plans permit any such amendment
or termination.

  



  

Section 5.9 Reservation of Shares; NASDAQ Listing.

  



  

(a) UBSH shall take all corporate action as may be necessary to
authorize and reserve for issuance such number of shares of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement, and to
cause all such shares, when issued pursuant to this Agreement, to be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

  



  

(b) UBSH shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause the shares
of the Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, subject to official
notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable, and in any event before the
Effective Time.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 5.10 Indemnification.

  



  

(a) Following the Effective Time, the Continuing Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall jointly and severally
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to any person who
has rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses from XBKS or any of
its Subsidiaries (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") (in any capacity), to the same
extent and on the same conditions as such person was entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to applicable law and
XBKS's Organizational Documents or any XBKS Subsidiary's Organizational
Documents, as the case may be, or any indemnification agreements to which an
Indemnified Party is a party as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
subject, in the case of advancement of expenses, to the Indemnified Party
providing a written undertaking to repay such advancements as contemplated by
Section 13.1-699A of the VSCA. Without limiting the foregoing, in any case or
proceeding in which corporate approval may be required to effectuate any
indemnification, the Continuing Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary
shall direct, if any Indemnified Party elects, that the determination
of permissibility of indemnification shall be made by independent counsel
mutually agreed upon between the Continuing Corporation or such Subsidiary
and such Indemnified Party.

  



  

(b) The Continuing Corporation shall, at or prior to the Effective
Time, purchase a six (6) year "tail" prepaid policy on the same terms and
conditions as the existing directors' and officers' liability (including
fiduciary and cyber coverage) insurance maintained by XBKS from insurance
carriers with comparable credit ratings, covering, without limitation, the
Merger; provided, however, that the cost of such "tail" policy shall in no
event exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the amount of the last annual
premium paid by XBKS for such existing directors' and officers' liability (and
fiduciary) insurance. If, but for the proviso to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Continuing Corporation would be required to expend more than
three hundred percent (300%) of current annual premiums, the Continuing
Corporation will obtain the maximum amount of that insurance obtainable by
payment of annual premiums equal to three hundred percent (300%) of current
annual premiums.

  



  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to
or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to XBKS or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this  _Section 5.10_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  



  

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her respective heirs and
legal representatives. The rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses and the other rights provided for herein shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

  



  

(e) If the Continuing Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not
the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfers
all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or
engages in any similar transaction, then in each case, the Continuing
Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Continuing Corporation will expressly assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.10_. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent
required by any agreement previously entered into by XBKS in connection with
a merger, acquisition or other business combination, the provisions of this
_Section 5.10_ shall apply to directors, officers, employees and fiduciaries
of predecessor entities previously acquired by XBKS.

Section 5.11 Employment and Other Arrangements.

  



  

Except for employees of XBKS or a Subsidiary listed in _Section 5.8(e)_ of
the XBKS Disclosure Letter, XBKS and UBSH agree that each employee of
XBKS and its Subsidiaries who is involuntarily terminated by XBKS following
the date of this Agreement and before the Effective Time shall receive
severance payments pursuant to the severance practice in use by XBKS as of the
date of this Agreement, subject to the execution of a release by such
employee. Except for employees of XBKS or a Subsidiary listed in _Section
5.8(e)_ of the XBKS Disclosure Letter, XBKS and UBSH agree that each employee
of XBKS and its Subsidiaries who is involuntarily terminated by the
Continuing Corporation or a Subsidiary on and after the Effective Time and
through the first anniversary after the Effective Time shall receive
severance payments pursuant to the Xenith Bank Severance Pay Plan, subject to
the execution of a release by such employee. Employees of XBKS or a
Subsidiary who are not listed in _Section 5.8(e)_ of the XBKS Disclosure
Letter shall not be eligible to receive severance benefits under any
UBSH/Union Bank severance plan during the one-year period after the
Effective Time.

  



  

Section 5.12 Consent to Assign and Use Leased Premises.

  



  

On _Section 5.12_  of its Disclosure Letter, XBKS has provided a list of all
leases with respect to real or personal property used by it or any
Subsidiary. With respect to the leases disclosed in _Section 5.12_ of its
Disclosure Letter, XBKS and each of its Subsidiaries will use commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents necessary or appropriate to
transfer and assign, as of the Effective Time, all right, title and interest
of XBKS and each of its Subsidiaries to the Continuing Corporation and to
permit the use and operation of the leased premises by the Continuing
Corporation.

  



  

Section 5.13 Change of Method.

  



  

UBSH and XBKS shall be empowered, upon their mutual agreement and at any time
prior to the Effective Time, to change the method or structure of
effecting the combination of UBSH and XBKS (including the provisions of
_Article 1_ and _Article 2_ ), if and to the extent they both deem such
change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; _provided_ that no such
change shall (i) alter or change the Exchange Ratio or Merger Consideration,
(ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of XBKS's or UBSH's
shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) adversely affect the tax
treatment of XBKS or UBSH pursuant to this Agreement or (iv)
materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby in a timely manner; and _provided_ _further_  that no such change
shall be made that would materially affect the tax consequences to XBKS or its
shareholders without the prior written consent of XBKS (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The parties hereto agree to
reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement
executed by both parties in accordance with _Section 8.2_.

  



  

Section 5.14 Takeover Laws.

  



  

If any Takeover Laws may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, each party hereto and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary and legally permissible (other than as
contemplated by _Section 5.4_ ) so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any such laws or regulations on any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



    

 | 47|

Section 5.15 Supplemental Indentures.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, XBKS and UBSH shall take all
actions necessary for UBSH to enter into a supplemental indenture or
other documents with the trustee of XBKS's trust preferred securities to
evidence the succession of UBSH as the obligor on those securities as of the
Effective Time and the parties hereto shall provide any opinion of counsel to
the trustee required to make such assumptions effective. UBSH shall be
responsible for the form of supplemental indenture, which form shall be
reasonably acceptable to XBKS. UBSH agrees to assume XBKS's obligations under
the above indentures and related subordinated debentures as well as under
guaranty agreements related to the trust preferred securities issued by XBKS's
trust subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, XBKS and UBSH shall take all
actions necessary for UBSH to enter into a supplemental indenture or
other documents with the trustee of XBKS's subordinated notes to evidence the
succession of UBSH as the obligor on those securities as of the Effective
Time and the parties hereto shall provide any opinion of counsel to the
trustee required to make such assumptions effective. UBSH shall be
responsible for the form of supplemental indenture, which form shall be
reasonably acceptable to XBKS. UBSH agrees to assume XBKS's obligations under
the above indenture.

  



  

Section 5.16 Shareholder Litigation.

  



  

XBKS shall give UBSH prompt notice of any shareholder litigation against such
party or its directors or affiliates (or combination thereof) relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall give UBSH the
opportunity to consult in the defense of any shareholder litigation relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall give UBSH the
right to review and comment on all filings or responses to be made by XBKS in
connection with any such litigation, and the right to consult on the
settlement with respect to any such litigation, and XBKS will in good faith
take such comments into account. In addition, no such settlement by XBKS
shall be agreed to without UBSH's prior written consent, and no such consent
of UBSH shall be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

Section 5.17 Section 16 Matters.

  



  

XBKS and UBSH agree that, to most effectively compensate and retain XBKS
Insiders (as defined below), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it
is desirable that XBKS Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of XBKS Common
Stock and XBKS Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and
retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this _Section 5.17_. XBKS shall
deliver to UBSH in a reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time
accurate information regarding those officers and directors of XBKS subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the "
_XBKS Insiders_ "), and the Board of Directors of UBSH and of XBKS, or a
committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly
thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps
as may be required to cause (in the case of XBKS) any dispositions of XBKS
Common Stock or XBKS Equity Awards (including the conversion of XBKS Warrants
into warrants to purchase Continuing Corporation Common Stock) by the XBKS
Insiders, and (in the case of UBSH) any acquisitions of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock or warrants to purchase Continuing Corporation Common
Stock by any XBKS Insiders who (if any), immediately following the Merger,
will be officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt
from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law.

Section 7.1 Termination.

  



  

This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby abandoned at any time before the Effective Time, whether
before or after the approval of the Merger by the shareholders of UBSH or
XBKS, as provided below:

  



  

(a) By the mutual consent in writing of UBSH and XBKS;

  



  

(b) By either UBSH or XBKS, evidenced by written notice, if the
Merger has not been consummated by March 31, 2018, provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be available to
any party whose action or failure to act has been the cause of or resulted in
the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date and such
action or failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

  



  

(c) By either UBSH or XBKS in the event any Regulatory Approval
required to be obtained pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)_ has been denied by the
relevant Governmental Authority and such denial has become final and
nonappealable or any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued a final, nonappealable injunction permanently enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated

this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants or agreements of such
party set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

(d) By either UBSH or XBKS (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation or warranty contained in

this Agreement) in the event of a breach or inaccuracy of any representation,
warranty or obligation of the other party contained in this Agreement which is
not cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to the
breaching party or by its nature cannot be cured within such time period and
which breach or inaccuracy would provide the terminating party the ability to
refuse to consummate the Merger under _Section 6.2(a)_  and _(b)_ in the case
of UBSH and _Section 6.3(a)_ and _(b)_ in the case of XBKS;

In the event of termination of this Agreement by either party as provided in
_Section 7.1_ , none of UBSH, XBKS, any of their respective Subsidiaries
or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability

Section 7.4 Termination Fee.

  



  

(a) In the event that (i) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to

the shareholders, senior management or Board of Directors of XBKS, or any
person or entity shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to XBKS after the
date of this Agreement, (ii) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (A) by

transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then XBKS shall, on the
earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement or the date of
consummation of such transaction, pay UBSH a fee equal to $26,500,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated by UBSH.

  



  

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by UBSH pursuant to

(d) Each of UBSH and XBKS acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 7.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, UBSH and XBKS,
respectively, would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if UBSH or
XBKS, as applicable, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this
_Section 7.4_ , and, in order to obtain such payment, UBSH or XBKS, as
applicable, commences a suit which results in a judgment against the other
party for the fee set forth in this _Section 7.4_ , UBSH or XBKS, as
applicable, shall pay to the other party its fees and expenses (including
attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate
published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was required to
be made. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and
are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have
hereunder.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without
limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out
of the other party's willful and material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, in the event that this Agreement is terminated as provided in
_Section 7.1_ , the maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or
damages payable by a single party under this Agreement shall be equal to the
Termination Fee, and neither party shall be obligated to pay the Termination
Fee on more than one occasion.

  



  

Section 7.5 Expenses.

  



  

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense;
provided, however, that the costs and expenses of printing and mailing the
Joint Proxy Statement and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC and other
Governmental Authorities in connection with the Merger shall be borne equally
by UBSH and XBKS.

Section 8.6 Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries.

  



  

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations shall
be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law
or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party. Any
purported assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided, including
without limitation _Sections 5.8_, _5.10_ and _5.11_ , this Agreement
(including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended
to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are
for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance herewith without notice or liability (but specifically excluding
the obligations set forth in _Sections 5.8_ , _5.10_ and _5.11_ ) to any other
person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely
upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations
of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of
any other date.

  



  

Section 8.7 Specific Performance.

  



  

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof
and, accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties'
obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby
further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post
security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  



  

Section 8.8 Waiver of Jury Trial.

  



  

Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under
this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues,
and therefore each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation,
directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party certifies and
acknowledges that (i) it understands and has considered the implications of
this waiver and (ii) it makes this waiver voluntarily.

  



  

Section 8.9 Severability.

  



  

In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable any other provisions hereof. Any provision
of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall
remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable. Further, the parties agree that a court of competent
jurisdiction may reform any provision of this Agreement held invalid or
unenforceable so as to reflect the intended agreement of the parties hereto.

ARTICLE 1

  

Terms of the Merger

  



  

1.1 The Merger.

  



  

Xenith Bankshares, Inc., a Virginia corporation (" _XBKS_ "), shall, at the
time of issuance of the Certificate of Merger by the State Corporation
Commission (the " _SCC_ ") of the Commonwealth of Virginia (or at such later
time as may be specified in the Articles of Merger filed with the SCC) (such
time being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ "), be merged (the "
_Merger_ ") with and into Union Bankshares Corporation, a Virginia
corporation (" _UBSH_ "). UBSH shall be the surviving corporation (the "
_Continuing Corporation_ ") in the Merger and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the separate
corporate existence of XBKS shall terminate.

  



  

1.2 Effects of the Merger.

  



  

At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section
13.1-721 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (the " _VSCA_ "). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of

ARTICLE 2

  

Merger Consideration; Exchange Procedures

  



  

2.1 Manner and Basis of Converting Shares.

  



  

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of UBSH or XBKS or the holder of any of the following securities:

  



    

 | Ex. 1.1-1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $1.33 per share, of UBSH
(" _UBSH Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of
the Continuing Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

  



  

(b) All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of XBKS
(" _XBKS Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are owned, directly or indirectly, by UBSH or XBKS (other
than shares of XBKS Common Stock held in trust accounts (including grantor or
rabbi trust accounts), managed accounts and similar accounts, or otherwise
held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third
parties) (any such shares, the " _XBKS Cancelled Shares_ ") shall no longer
be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) Each share of XBKS Common Stock, except for XBKS Cancelled
Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will cease to be outstanding and will be converted automatically into and
exchanged for the right to receive 0.9354 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ")
of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par
value $1.33 per share, of the Continuing Corporation (" _Continuing
Corporation Common Stock_ ") (with respect to a given share of XBKS Common
Stock, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.6, the "
_Merger Consideration_ ") it being understood that upon the Effective Time,
pursuant to Section 2.1(a), UBSH Common Stock, including the shares issued to
former holders of XBKS Common Stock, shall be the Continuing Corporation
Common Stock.

  



  

(d) If, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of UBSH Common Stock or XBKS Common Stock shall have
been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number
or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar change in
capitalization, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made to
the Exchange Ratio, and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Plan of
Merger.

  



  

2.2 Exchange Procedures.

  



  

(a) _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time,
UBSH shall appoint an exchange and paying agent reasonably acceptable to
XBKS (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment and exchange of the Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, UBSH shall for the benefit of
holders of shares of XBKS Common Stock and the holders of XBKS Stock Options,
XBKS Restricted Stock Awards, XBKS RSU Awards and the XBKS Warrants ( each as
defined herein and collectively, " _XBKS Equity Awards_ ") and for exchange
in accordance with this Article 2, (i) deposit, or cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent an amount of cash sufficient to pay (A) the cash payable
in lieu of fractional shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock and (B)
the cash payable with respect to the XBKS Equity Awards (such cash deposited
pursuant to this clause (i), the " _Exchange Fund_ "), and (ii) evidence of
shares in book-entry form, representing the shares of the
Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be issued and paid pursuant to this
Article 2.

  



    

 | Ex. 1.1-2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Letter of Transmittal_. UBSH shall prepare appropriate and
customary transmittal materials on which UBSH and XBKS shall mutually
agree (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). The Letter of Transmittal shall
specify that delivery of the Letter of Transmittal and, as applicable, title
and risk of loss with respect to (i) an outstanding Certificate or outstanding
Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represent
outstanding shares of XBKS Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ "), and
(ii) uncertificated shares of XBKS Common Stock represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case other than XBKS Cancelled Shares, shall
be effected only upon proper delivery of the completed Letter of Transmittal
and, as applicable and subject to Section 2.3(d), the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent. UBSH shall make
available and mail the Letter of Transmittal not more than five (5) business
days after the Effective Time to all persons who were record holders of
shares of XBKS Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and use
its reasonable best efforts to make the Letter of Transmittal available to
any such shareholder who requests such Letter of Transmittal.

  



  

2.3 Exchange of Shares.

  



  

(a) Each holder of an outstanding share of XBKS Common Stock who has
properly surrendered such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent (or has complied with Section 2.3(d), together with a Letter of
Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documentation as the Exchange Agent and
UBSH may reasonably require, shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect to such share of XBKS Common Stock in accordance
with Section 2.3(b).

  



  

(b) Whenever a holder of an outstanding share of XBKS Common Stock
shall become entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.3(a), in addition to the rights of such holder set forth in Section
2.4, any such holder shall be entitled to receive:

  



  

(i) evidence of issuance in book-entry form the number of whole
shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which the aggregate
number of shares of XBKS Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been
converted pursuant to this Plan of Merger; and

  



  

(ii) the amount of cash, if any, into which the aggregate number of
shares of XBKS Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to Section
2.6 of this Plan of Merger.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, the Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to
deliver the Merger Consideration to which any holder of XBKS Common Stock is
entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders his, her or
its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, or otherwise complies with Section
2.3(d), for exchange as provided in Section 2.3(a). Whenever a holder of an
outstanding share of XBKS Common Stock shall become entitled to receive any
Merger Consideration, the Continuing Corporation shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to deliver such Merger
Consideration to such holder within two (2) business days thereafter.

  



    

 | Ex. 1.1-3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Abandoned Property._ Any other provision of this Plan of
Merger notwithstanding, neither the Continuing Corporation nor the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to a holder of XBKS Common Stock for any amounts paid
or property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property law.

  



  

(d) _Lost Certificates_. A holder of XBKS Common Stock whose
Certificates have been lost, destroyed, stolen or are otherwise missing
shall be entitled to receive its portion of the Merger Consideration and
dividends or distributions to which such shareholder shall be entitled, if
any, upon compliance with reasonable conditions imposed by the Continuing
Corporation and the Exchange Agent pursuant to applicable law and as required
in accordance with the Continuing Corporation's and the Exchange Agent's
standard policy (including the requirement that the shareholder furnish an
affidavit of lost certificate, surety bond or other customary indemnity).

  



  

(e) _Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Continuing Corporation;
_provided_ , that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
Merger Consideration, and the Continuing Corporation shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of XBKS
Common Stock or XBKS Equity Awards in the amount of any such losses to the
extent necessary for payment of the cash portion of the Merger Consideration.
Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
the Continuing Corporation or as directed by the Continuing Corporation. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the former holders of XBKS Common Stock or
XBKS Equity Awards for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, to
the extent permitted by law, be paid to the Continuing Corporation. Any
former holder of XBKS Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Continuing Corporation for
payment of the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions
on Continuing Corporation Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former
share of XBKS Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to
this Plan of Merger, in each case, without any interest thereon.

  



  

(f) _Rounding_. All dollar amounts payable to any registered holder
of XBKS Common Stock pursuant to this Article 2 shall be rounded to the
nearest whole cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward), based on the
aggregate amount payable for all shares of XBKS Common Stock registered in
such shareholder's name. 

  



    

 | Ex. 1.1-4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.4 Rights of Former Holders of XBKS Common Stock.

  



  

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of XBKS shall be closed as to
holders of XBKS Common Stock, and no transfer of XBKS Common Stock by any such
holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange
in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3(a), each Book-Entry Share or
Certificate shall from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes
only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
in exchange therefor. To the extent permitted by law, former holders of record
of XBKS Common Stock shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at

shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which their respective
shares of XBKS Common Stock are converted, regardless of whether such holders
have surrendered their Book-Entry Shares or Certificates for exchange as
provided in Section 2.3(a), but beginning thirty (30) days after the
Effective Time, no such holder shall be entitled to vote on any matter until
such holder surrenders such Certificate or Book-Entry Share for exchange as
provided in Section 2.3(a). Whenever a dividend or other distribution
is declared by the Continuing Corporation on Continuing Corporation Common
Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the

distribution payable to the holders of record of XBKS Common Stock, if any, as
of any time subsequent to the Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder
of any Book-Entry Share or Certificate issued and outstanding at the
Effective Time until such holder surrenders such Book-Entry Share or
Certificate for exchange as provided in Section 2.3(a). However,
upon surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate representing XBKS
Common Stock, the Merger Consideration, together with all such undelivered
dividends or other distributions without interest, shall be delivered and paid
with respect to each Book-Entry Share or other share represented by such
Certificate.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of XBKS
Common Stock (an " _XBKS Stock Option_ ") granted under any equity or equity-
based compensation plans maintained by XBKS under which awards are currently
outstanding or any awards may be made thereunder (collectively, a " _XBKS
Stock Plan_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease, at the
Effective Time, to represent a right to acquire XBKS Common Stock and shall
be automatically converted at the Effective Time without any action on the
part of the holder thereof into the right to receive a cash payment in an
amount equal to the product of (i) the difference between (A) the product of
the average of the closing sale prices of UBSH Common Stock on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market for the ten (10) full trading days ending on the trading
day immediately preceding (but not including) the Effective Time and the
Exchange Ratio (the " _Conversion Price_ ") and (b) the per share exercise
price of the XBKS Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(B) the number of shares of XBKS Common Stock subject to such XBKS Stock
Option, subject to any applicable withholdings authorized by Section 2.8. If
the exercise price of an XBKS Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time is greater than the Conversion Price, then at the Effective Time such
XBKS Stock Option shall be cancelled without any payment made in exchange
therefor.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock award granted under
an XBKS Stock Plan, which is unvested or contingent and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (an " _XBKS Restricted
Stock Award_ "), shall vest fully and shall be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Plan of Merger in
respect of each share of XBKS Common Stock underlying such XBKS Restricted
Stock Award, and the shares of XBKS Common Stock subject to such XBKS
Restricted Stock Award will be treated in the same manner as all other shares
of XBKS Common Stock for such purposes.

  



    

 | Ex. 1.1-5|

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in
respect of shares of XBKS Common Stock that is outstanding and

" _XBKS RSU Award_ ") shall vest fully and shall be converted into the right
to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
this Plan of Merger in respect of each share of XBKS Common Stock underlying
such XBKS RSU Award.

  



  

2.6 No Fractional Shares.

  



  

Each holder of shares of XBKS Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger
which would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock
multiplied by the product of (i) the average of the closing sale prices of
UBSH Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the ten (10) full
trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding (but not
including) the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

  



  

2.7 XBKS Warrants.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase shares of XBKS
Common Stock (an " _XBKS Warrant_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease, at the Effective Time, to
represent a right to acquire XBKS Common Stock and shall be automatically
converted at the Effective Time without any action on the part of the holder
thereof into the right to purchase shares of Continuing Corporation Common
Stock upon exercise of such XBKS Warrant, with the exercise price of each
share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock subject to such XBKS Warrant and
the number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock subject to such
XBKS Warrant determined as provided below:

  



  

(i) the number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock to
be subject to the XBKS Warrant shall be equal to the product of the number of
shares of XBKS Common Stock subject to the XBKS Warrant immediately prior to
the Effective Time and the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional
shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share; and

  



  

(ii) the exercise price per share of Continuing Corporation Common
Stock under the XBKS Warrant shall be equal to the exercise price per share
of Continuing Corporation Common Stock under the XBKS Warrant immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that if
the exercise price resulting from such division includes a fractional cent,
the exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.

2.8 Withholding Rights.

  



  

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Plan of Merger to any person
such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in
the Agreement) law. The Continuing Corporation will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts payable by it pursuant to Article 2 of this Plan of
Merger to any person such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority by

THIS AFFILIATE AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 19, 2017, is
by and among UNION BANKSHARES CORPORATION, a Virginia corporation (" _UBSH_
"), XENITH BANKSHARES, INC., a Virginia corporation (" _XBKS_ "), and the
undersigned shareholder of XBKS (the " _Shareholder_ "). All terms used
herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the
Merger Agreement (defined below).

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of UBSH and XBKS have approved a business
combination of their companies through the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of XBKS
with and into UBSH pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization, dated as of May 19, 2017, between UBSH and XBKS, and
a related Plan of Merger (together referred to herein as the " _Merger
Agreement_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Shareholder is the beneficial or registered owner of, and has
the sole power to vote or direct the disposition of the number of shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of XBKS (" _XBKS Common Stock_ ")
set forth opposite the Shareholder's name on _Schedule A_ hereto (such
shares, together with all shares of XBKS Common Stock subsequently acquired by
the Shareholder during the term of this Agreement and over which such
Shareholder has the sole power to vote or direct the disposition, are referred
to herein as the " _Shares_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to UBSH and XBKS entering into the
Merger Agreement, the Shareholder has agreed to enter into and perform this
Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, and
other good and valuable consideration (including the merger consideration set
forth in Article 2 of the Merger Agreement), the receipt and sufficiency of
which are acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound
hereby, agree as follows:

  



  

1 _._ Agreement to Vote; Revocable Proxy.

  



  

(a) During the term of this Agreement and at such time as XBKS
conducts the XBKS Shareholders Meeting, the Shareholder agrees to vote or
cause to be voted all of the Shares, and to cause any holder of record of the
Shares to vote all such Shares, in person or by proxy: (i) in favor of the
Merger Agreement at the XBKS Shareholders Meeting; and (ii) against (A) any
Acquisition Proposal, (B) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement
which could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
XBKS under the Merger Agreement or of the Shareholder under this Agreement
and (C) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that could reasonably
be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely affect or
inhibit the timely consummation of the Merger or the fulfillment of UBSH's
or XBKS's conditions under the Merger Agreement.

  



    

 | Ex. 6.2(e)-1|

(b) Shareholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies granted
with respect to the Shareholder's Shares. By entering into this
Agreement, Shareholder hereby grants a revocable proxy appointing UBSH as
such Shareholder's attorney-in-fact and proxy, with full power of
substitution, for and in such Shareholder's name, to vote, express consent or
dissent, or otherwise to utilize such voting power in the manner contemplated
by Section 1(a) above as UBSH or its proxy or substitute shall, in UBSH's sole
discretion, deem proper with respect to the Shareholder's Shares. The proxy
granted by Shareholder pursuant to this Section 1 is revocable and is granted
in consideration of UBSH entering into this Agreement and the Merger Agreement
and incurring certain related fees and expenses. The proxy granted by
Shareholder shall be revoked upon termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms.

this Agreement, the term " _beneficial ownership_ " shall be interpreted in
accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

  



  

(b) _Restrictions on Transfer._ During the term of this Agreement,

interest in, transfer or otherwise dispose of or encumber any of the Shares
and will not enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (other
than a proxy for the purpose of voting the Shareholder's Shares in accordance
with Section 1 hereof) which would during that term (i) restrict, (ii)
establish a right of first refusal to, or (iii) otherwise relate to, the
transfer or voting of the Shares.

  



  

(c) _Authority. _ The Shareholder has full power, authority and
legal capacity to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement and to

duly and validly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Shareholder, enforceable against
the Shareholder in accordance with its terms.

  



  

(d) _No Breach._ None of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation by the Shareholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby will result in a violation of, or a default under, or
conflict with, any contract, loan and credit arrangements, Liens (as defined
in Section 2(e) below), trust, commitment, agreement, understanding,
arrangement or restriction of any kind to which the Shareholder is a party or
bound or to which the Shares are subject.

the Shares are now, and at all times during the term of this Agreement, will
be, held by the Shareholder, or by a nominee or custodian for the benefit of
the Shareholder, free and clear of all pledges, liens, security interests,
claims, proxies, voting trusts or agreements, understandings or arrangements
or any other encumbrances whatsoever (each, a " _Lien_ "), except for (i) any
Liens arising hereunder, and (ii) Liens, if any, which have been disclosed on
_Schedule B_ attached hereto.

  



    

 | Ex. 6.2(e)-2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) _Consents and Approvals_. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Shareholder does not, and the performance by the
Shareholder of his or her obligations under this Agreement and the
consummation by him or her of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
require the Shareholder to obtain any consent, approval, authorization or
permit of, or to make any filing with or notification to, any Governmental
Authority.

  



  

(g) _Absence of Litigation_. There is no suit, action,
investigation or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Shareholder,
threatened against or affecting the Shareholder or any of his or her
affiliates before or by any Governmental Authority that could reasonably be
expected to materially impair the ability of the Shareholder to perform his or
her obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

(h) _No Solicitation_. During the term of this Agreement, the
Shareholder shall not, nor shall he or she permit any investment
banker, attorney or other adviser or representative of the Shareholder to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of
any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect
to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(i) _Statements_. Except in connection with a Change in XBKS
Recommendation, the Shareholder shall not make any public statement, written
or oral, to the effect that he or she does not support the Merger or that
other shareholders of XBKS should not support the Merger.

  



  

3. No Prior Proxies.

  



  

The Shareholder represents, warrants and covenants that any prior proxies or
voting rights previously given in respect of the Shares are revocable, and
that any such proxies or voting rights are hereby irrevocably revoked.

  



  

4. Certain Events. 

  



  

The Shareholder agrees that this Agreement and the obligations hereunder
shall attach to the Shares and shall be binding upon any person or entity to
which legal or beneficial ownership of the Shares shall pass, whether by
operation of law or otherwise, including the Shareholder's successors or
assigns. In the event of any stock split, stock dividend, merger, exchange,
reorganization, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of
XBKS affecting the Shares, the number of Shares subject to the terms of this
Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted, and this Agreement and the
obligations hereunder shall attach to any additional securities of XBKS issued
to or acquired by the Shareholder.

5. Capacity; Obligation to Vote.

the event that the Board of Directors of XBKS is permitted to engage in
negotiations or discussions with any person who made an unsolicited _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section 5.5 of the
Merger Agreement, the Shareholder shall be permitted, at the request of the
Board of Directors of XBKS, to respond to inquiries from, and discuss such
Acquisition Proposal with, the Board of Directors of XBKS. With respect to the
terms of this Agreement relating to the Shares, this Agreement relates solely
to the capacity of the Shareholder as a shareholder or other beneficial owner
of the Shares and is not in any way intended to affect or prevent the
exercise by the Shareholder of his or her responsibilities as a director or
officer of XBKS, including actions permitted to be taken in compliance with
Section 5.5 of the Merger Agreement. The term "Shares" shall not include any

EXHIBIT 6.3(d)

  



  

AFFILIATE AGREEMENT

  



  

THIS AFFILIATE AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 19, 2017, is
by and among UNION BANKSHARES CORPORATION, a Virginia corporation (" _UBSH_
"), XENITH BANKSHARES, INC., a Virginia corporation (" _XBKS_ "), and the
undersigned shareholder of UBSH (the " _Shareholder_ "). All terms used
herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the
Merger Agreement (defined below).

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of UBSH and XBKS have approved a business
combination of their companies through the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of XBKS
with and into UBSH pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization, dated as of May 19, 2017, between UBSH and XBKS, and
a related Plan of Merger (together referred to herein as the " _Merger
Agreement_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Shareholder is the beneficial or registered owner of, and has
the sole power to vote or direct the disposition of the number of shares of
common stock, par value $1.33 per share, of UBSH (" _UBSH Common Stock_ ")
set forth opposite the Shareholder's name on _Schedule A_ hereto (such
shares, together with all shares of UBSH Common Stock subsequently acquired by
the Shareholder during the term of this Agreement and over which such
Shareholder has the sole power to vote or direct the disposition, are referred
to herein as the " _Shares_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to XBKS and UBSH entering into the
Merger Agreement, the Shareholder has agreed to enter into and perform this
Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, and
other good and valuable consideration (including the merger consideration set
forth in Article 2 of the Merger Agreement), the receipt and sufficiency of
which are acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound
hereby, agree as follows:

  



  

1 _._ Agreement to Vote; Revocable Proxy.

  



  

(a) During the term of this Agreement and at such time as UBSH
conducts the UBSH Shareholders Meeting, the Shareholder agrees to vote or
cause to be voted all of the Shares, and to cause any holder of record of the
Shares to vote all such Shares, in person or by proxy: (i) in favor of the
Merger Agreement at the UBSH Shareholders Meeting; and (ii) against (A) any
Acquisition Proposal, (B) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement
which could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
UBSH under the Merger Agreement or of the Shareholder under this Agreement
and (C) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that could reasonably
be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely affect or
inhibit the timely consummation of the Merger or the fulfillment of XBKS's
or UBSH's conditions under the Merger Agreement.

  



    

 | Ex. 6.3(d)-1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Shareholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies granted
with respect to the Shareholder's Shares. By entering into this
Agreement, Shareholder hereby grants a revocable proxy appointing XBKS as
such Shareholder's attorney-in-fact and proxy, with full power of
substitution, for and in such Shareholder's name, to vote, express consent or
dissent, or otherwise to utilize such voting power in the manner contemplated
by Section 1(a) above as XBKS or its proxy or substitute shall, in XBKS's sole
discretion, deem proper with respect to the Shareholder's Shares. The proxy
granted by Shareholder pursuant to this Section 1 is revocable and is granted
in consideration of XBKS entering into this Agreement and the Merger Agreement
and incurring certain related fees and expenses. The proxy granted by
Shareholder shall be revoked upon termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms.

  



  

2. Covenants of Shareholder. 

  



  

The Shareholder represents, warrants, covenants and/or agrees as follows:

  



  

(a) _Ownership._  The Shareholder is the beneficial or registered
owner of the Shares as set forth opposite the Shareholder's name on
_Schedule A_ hereto. Except for the Shareholder's Shares, the Shareholder is
not the beneficial or registered owner of any other shares of UBSH Common
Stock or rights to acquire shares of UBSH Common Stock and for which
Shareholder has sole right and power to vote and/or dispose. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _beneficial ownership_ " shall be interpreted in
accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

  



  

(b) _Restrictions on Transfer._ During the term of this Agreement,
the Shareholder will not sell, pledge, hypothecate, grant a security
interest in, transfer or otherwise dispose of or encumber any of the Shares
and will not enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (other
than a proxy for the purpose of voting the Shareholder's Shares in accordance
with Section 1 hereof) which would during that term (i) restrict, (ii)
establish a right of first refusal to, or (iii) otherwise relate to, the
transfer or voting of the Shares.

  



  

(c) _Authority. _ The Shareholder has full power, authority and
legal capacity to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform fully the Shareholder's obligations hereunder (including the
revocable proxy described in Section 1(b) hereof). This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Shareholder, enforceable against
the Shareholder in accordance with its terms.

  



  

(d) _No Breach._ None of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation by the Shareholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby will result in a violation of, or a default under, or
conflict with, any contract, loan and credit arrangements, Liens (as defined
in Section 2(e) below), trust, commitment, agreement, understanding,
arrangement or restriction of any kind to which the Shareholder is a party or
bound or to which the Shares are subject.

  



  

(e) _No Liens._ The Shares and the certificates representing any of
the Shares are now, and at all times during the term of this Agreement, will
be, held by the Shareholder, or by a nominee or custodian for the benefit of
the Shareholder, free and clear of all pledges, liens, security interests,
claims, proxies, voting trusts or agreements, understandings or arrangements
or any other encumbrances whatsoever (each, a " _Lien_ "), except for (i) any
Liens arising hereunder, and (ii) Liens, if any, which have been disclosed on
_Schedule B_ attached hereto.

  



    

 | Ex. 6.3(d)-2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) _Consents and Approvals_. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Shareholder does not, and the performance by the
Shareholder of his or her obligations under this Agreement and the
consummation by him or her of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
require the Shareholder to obtain any consent, approval, authorization or
permit of, or to make any filing with or notification to, any Governmental
Authority.

  



  

(g) _Absence of Litigation_. There is no suit, action,
investigation or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Shareholder,
threatened against or affecting the Shareholder or any of his or her
affiliates before or by any Governmental Authority that could reasonably be
expected to materially impair the ability of the Shareholder to perform his or
her obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

(h) _No Solicitation_. During the term of this Agreement, the
Shareholder shall not, nor shall he or she permit any investment
banker, attorney or other adviser or representative of the Shareholder to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of
any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect
to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(i) _Statements_. Except in connection with a Change in UBSH
Recommendation, the Shareholder shall not make any public statement, written
or oral, to the effect that he or she does not support the Merger or that
other shareholders of UBSH should not support the Merger.

  



  

3. No Prior Proxies.

  



  

The Shareholder represents, warrants and covenants that any prior proxies or
voting rights previously given in respect of the Shares are revocable, and
that any such proxies or voting rights are hereby irrevocably revoked.

  



  

4. Certain Events. 

  



  

The Shareholder agrees that this Agreement and the obligations hereunder
shall attach to the Shares and shall be binding upon any person or entity to
which legal or beneficial ownership of the Shares shall pass, whether by
operation of law or otherwise, including the Shareholder's successors or
assigns. In the event of any stock split, stock dividend, merger, exchange,
reorganization, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of
UBSH affecting the Shares, the number of Shares subject to the terms of this
Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted, and this Agreement and the
obligations hereunder shall attach to any additional securities of UBSH issued
to or acquired by the Shareholder.

Board of Directors of UBSH, to respond to inquiries from, and discuss such
Acquisition Proposal with, the Board of Directors of UBSH. With respect to the
terms of this Agreement relating to the Shares, this Agreement relates solely
to the capacity of the Shareholder as a shareholder or other beneficial owner
of the Shares and is not in any way intended to affect or prevent the
