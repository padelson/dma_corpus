Rights</I>. Union shall, and the Shareholder may, at its option, enter into by no later than thirty (30) days following the Effective
Time a registration rights agreement (the &ldquo;<U>Registration Rights Agreement</U>&rdquo;) among Union, the Shareholder and
certain other shareholders of Union who have entered into a voting agreement with Union that is substantially identical to and
of even date with the Agreement (Shareholder and such other shareholders, collectively, the &ldquo;<U>Institutional Shareholders</U>&rdquo;).
The Registration Rights Agreement shall apply to up to all shares of Union Common Stock which the Institutional Shareholders, as
of the Effective Time, own or have the right to receive pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (the &ldquo;<U>Registrable
Securities</U>&rdquo;). The Registration Rights Agreement shall contain customary terms and conditions, including, but not limited
to the following: (i) an obligation of Union, upon the request of any of the Institutional Shareholders, at any time on and after
the 20<SUP>th</SUP> Business Day prior to the expiration of the Lock-Up Period, to prepare and file a shelf registration statement
with respect to the Registrable Securities (the &ldquo;<U>Registration Statement</U>&rdquo;), and to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to keep the Registration Statement continuously effective for twelve (12) months following the effective date of the Registration
Statement (such period, the &ldquo;<U>Registration Period</U>&rdquo;); (ii) demand rights for underwritten offerings of Registrable
Securities under the Registration Statement, which rights may be exercised one (1) time by each Institutional Shareholder during
the Registration Period upon the request of such Institutional Shareholder; (iii) lockup provisions; (iv) Union-initiated blackout
periods; and (v) indemnification; <I>provided</I> that the foregoing provisions shall not prohibit or restrict the Shareholder
from making a distribution of Registrable Securities at any time following the Lock-Up Period to any of its limited partners or
other investors for no consideration. The Registration Rights Agreement shall also provide for the following: (a) all expenses
of any registration and Registration Statement described in clause (i) above and in connection with any underwritten offering described
in clause (ii) above, including in both cases attorneys&rsquo; fees, shall be borne by Union; <I>provided, however</I>, that Union
shall have no obligation with respect to any discounts, selling commissions, or stock transfer taxes applicable to the sale of
Registrable Securities; (b) sales of Registrable Securities shall be conditioned such that any purchaser thereof (other than an
underwriter or any investment bank or broker executing a block trade) shall not own more than 4.9% of the total Union Common Stock
outstanding at the time of such sale; and (c) Union shall provide commercially reasonable assistance with any underwritten offering
or unregistered block trades of Registrable Securities, including, but not limited to, making senior officers and representatives
available for investor and diligence meetings and calls, provided Union is given reasonable notice of such meetings and calls and
such meetings and calls are conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of Union&rsquo;s
business.</P>
