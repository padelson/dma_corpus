Section 2.03. Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment. Not later than five
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a
statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth (a) Seller's good faith
estimate of (i) Closing Cash (provided that, solely for purposes of such
estimate, Domestic Cash shall be assumed to be zero), (ii) Closing
Indebtedness and (iii) Closing Working Capital and (b) using the amounts set
forth in the preceding clause (a), Seller's calculation of the Aggregate
Purchase Price (such calculation, the "Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price").
Upon delivery of the Closing Statement, Seller shall (x) permit Buyer and its
Representatives to have reasonable access to the books, records and other
documents (including work papers, schedules, financial statements, and
memoranda) pertaining to or used in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Statement and Seller's calculation of the Estimated Aggregate Purchase
Price and provide Buyer with copies thereof and (y) provide Buyer and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice to Seller's and the Company's executive officers and,
subject to Buyer and its Representatives satisfying any customary conditions
imposed by the external accountants, accountants (including making the
Company's Chief Financial Officer and, subject to Buyer and its
Representatives satisfying any customary conditions imposed by the external
accountants, accountants available during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice to respond to reasonable written or oral inquiries of Buyer
or its Representatives). Not less than two Business Days prior to the Closing,
Buyer shall notify Seller of its good faith objections, if any, to the Closing
Statement. Seller shall consider in good faith Buyer's objections to the
Closing Statement calculations and shall revise such calculations, if, based
on its good faith assessment of Buyer's comments, such changes are warranted,
which revised calculations shall become the applicable Closing Statement. If
Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Closing
Statement, such dispute shall not under any circumstance delay the Closing,
and the Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price shall be calculated as set forth in
the Closing Statement (as modified to reflect the resolution of any objection
by Buyer with which Seller has agreed, if any), for the purposes of the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing three sentences, in no event will any
of Buyer's rights under Section

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.04 or the remaining provisions of this Agreement be considered waived,
impaired or otherwise limited as a result of Buyer not making an objection
prior to the Closing or its making an objection that is not fully implemented
in a revised Closing Statement.

  

  

Section 2.04. Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment. (a) As promptly as
practicable, but no later than 75 days, after the Closing Date, Seller will
cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a statement (the "Post-Closing
Statement") setting forth (a) Seller's calculations of (i) Closing Cash, (ii)
Closing Indebtedness and (iii) Closing Working Capital and (b) using the
amounts set forth in the preceding clause (a), Seller's calculation of the
Aggregate Purchase Price.

  

  

(b) If Buyer disagrees with Seller's calculation of any of the items set forth
in the Post-Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a), Buyer
may, within 30 days after delivery of the documents referred to in Section
2.04(a), deliver a notice to Seller disagreeing with such calculation and
which specifies Buyer's calculation of such amount and the resulting
calculation of Aggregate Purchase Price and, in reasonable detail, Buyer's
grounds for such disagreement. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify
those items or amounts as to which Buyer disagrees, and Buyer shall be deemed
to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Post-Closing
Statement delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a).

  

  

(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.04(b), Buyer and Seller shall, during the 30 days following such delivery,
use their reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine the amount of the Aggregate Purchase Price. If
Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement during such period, they
shall promptly thereafter cause independent accountants of nationally
recognized standing in the United States reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and
Seller (who shall not have any material relationship with Buyer or Seller or
any of their respective Affiliates), promptly to review this Agreement and the
disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the amount of the
Aggregate Purchase Price. In making such calculation, such independent
accountants shall consider only those items or amounts in the Post-Closing
Statement as to which Buyer and Seller were unable to resolve. In making its
determination the independent accountant shall (A) be bound by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation, the definitions of
Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash and Closing Indebtedness and the terms
of this Section 2.04, and (B) may not assign any value with respect to a
disputed amount that is greater than the highest value for such amount claimed
by either Buyer or Seller or that is less than the lowest value for such
amount claimed by either Buyer or Seller. Such independent accountants shall
deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable, a report setting
forth such calculation. Absent manifest error, such report shall be final and
binding upon Buyer and Seller. The cost of such review

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

and report shall be borne (i) by Seller if the difference between the Final
Aggregate Purchase Price and Seller's calculation of the Aggregate Purchase
Price delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a) is greater than the difference
between the Final Aggregate Purchase Price and Buyer's calculation of the
Aggregate Purchase Price delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b), (ii) by Buyer
if the first such difference is less than the second such difference and (iii)
otherwise equally by Buyer and Seller.

  

  

(d) Buyer and Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause their respective
independent accountants and the Company and each other Transferred Entity to,
reasonably cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Post-Closing
Statement, the calculation of the Aggregate Purchase Price, and in the conduct
of the reviews referred to in this Section 2.04, including the making
available to the extent reasonably necessary of books, records, work papers
and personnel (subject to reasonable confidentiality restrictions and to
providing such assurances, releases, indemnities or other agreements as
accountants may customarily require in such circumstances).

  

  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, neither Section 2.03 nor Section 2.04 is
intended to be used to adjust for errors or omissions that may be found with
respect to the Statement of Financial Condition or the Base Working Capital,
for which Article 11 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy. No fact or event,
including any market or business development, occurring after the Closing
Date, and no change in GAAP or Applicable Law after the date hereof, shall be
taken into consideration in the calculations to be made pursuant to Section
2.04. It is understood that (i) the Illustrative Working Capital Statement set
forth in Exhibit A is attached only for the purposes set forth in the
definition of "Closing Working Capital" and (ii) the Base Working Capital is a
negotiated number derived independently of the Illustrative Working Capital
Statement.

  

  

Section 2.05. Purchase Price Adjustment. (a) If the Estimated Aggregate
Purchase Price exceeds the Final Aggregate Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to
Buyer, as an adjustment to the Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price, in the
manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.05(b), the amount of such
excess. If the Final Aggregate Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Aggregate
Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay to Seller, in the manner and with interest as
provided in Section 2.05(b), the amount of such excess. "Final Aggregate
Purchase Price" means the Aggregate Purchase Price (i) as shown in Seller's
calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a), if no notice of
disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.04(b); or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed
by Buyer and Seller pursuant to Section 2.04(c) or (B) in the absence of such
agreement, as shown in the independent accountant's calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 2.04(c); provided that in no event shall the Final
Aggregate Purchase Price be more than Seller's calculation of the Aggregate
Purchase Price delivered pursuant to Section

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.04(a) or less than Buyer's calculation of the Aggregate Purchase Price
delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b).

  

  

(b) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.05(a) shall be made at a mutually
convenient time and place within 10 days after the Final Aggregate Purchase
Price has been determined, by delivery by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be,
of a wire transfer of immediately available funds to the other party or as
directed thereby. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this
Section 2.05 shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but
excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as
published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect from time to
time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such
interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates
and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the
actual number of days elapsed.

misappropriation of Intellectual Property Rights of any third person (which,
in the latter case, is covered exclusively in Section 3.17).

intention to terminate the employment of any Key Executive.

  

  

(b) Seller and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) have
materially complied with all Applicable Law relating to labor and employment

to Applicable Law, must be notified, consulted or with which negotiations need

Agreement. Seller and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities)
have complied in all material respects with respect to each collective
bargaining agreement or other similar labor agreement set forth on the Section
3.20(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and Seller has provided to Buyer
prior to the date hereof copies of each such agreement and any ancillary

made available to Buyer a true and complete copy of each Employee Plan (and,
if applicable, related trust or funding agreements or insurance policies), and
all amendments thereto, together with the most recent annual report (Form
5500), prepared prior to the date hereof. For purposes hereof, an "Employee
Plan" means each material "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA), each material employment,
individual consulting, retention, change-in-control, severance or similar
contract, plan, program, arrangement or policy and each other material
contract, plan, program, arrangement or policy (written or oral) providing for

Transferred

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Entities) and any of their ERISA Affiliates and which covers any current or
former employee, director, consultant or other service provider of the
Transferred Entities or any Company Employee or (B) with respect to which the
Transferred Entities have or will have any liability (including contingent
liability) following the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Employee
Plans shall not include any plan, arrangement or policy maintained or
established by a Governmental Authority.

  

  

(b) Neither the Transferred Entities nor any ERISA Affiliate of the
Transferred Entities (or any of their respective predecessors), sponsors,
maintains or contributes to (or is required to contribute to), or has in the
past six years sponsored, maintained or contributed to (or has been required
to contribute to), or in any way has any liability, directly or indirectly,
with respect to (i) any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section
412, 430 or 4971 of the Code, (ii) any "multiemployer plan", as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA, (iii) any "multiple employer plan," as described in
Section 413 of the Code, or (iv) any plan maintained in connection with any
trust described in Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No event has occurred and no
condition exists that could reasonably be expected to subject any of the
Transferred Entities to liability under ERISA or the Code as a consequence of
any Transferred Entity being considered an ERISA Affiliate with any other
Person prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

(c) Each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter, or has pending or
has time remaining in which to file, an application for such determination
from the Internal Revenue Service, any such determination letter issued has
not been revoked and the Company is not aware of any reason why any such
determination letter should be revoked or not be reissued. Each Employee Plan
has been established, maintained, funded and administered in material
compliance with its terms and in all material respects with the requirements
prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including
ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such Employee Plan. Other than
routine benefit claims there are no pending or, to the knowledge of Seller,
threatened actions, claims or lawsuits against or relating to an Employee
Plan. All premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding
any Employee Plan sponsored or maintained by the Transferred Entities for any
period through the date hereof have been made in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or prior to the date hereof, have been properly
accrued. No Employee Plan is presently the subject of an examination or audit
by a Governmental Authority or is the subject of an application or filing
under, or is a participant in, a government sponsored amnesty, voluntary
compliance, self-correction or similar program.

  

  

(d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, alone or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

together with any other event, (i) accelerate the time of vesting, timing,
funding or payment of any compensation or benefit, or increase the amount of
compensation or benefits due to any current or former employee, director,
officer or independent contractor of the Transferred Entities or any Company
Employee, or (ii) result in any severance or other payment becoming due to any
current or former employee, director, officer or independent contractor of the
Transferred Entities or any Company Employee. No Company Employee or other
service provider of the Transferred Entities is entitled to any gross-up,
make-whole or other additional payment in respect of any Tax (including Taxes
imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code) or interest or penalty related
thereto. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not constitute a "change in ownership," a "change in effective control"
or a "change in ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of Seller
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

  

  

(e) No Employee Plan provides post-employment or post-retirement health or
medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees of
the Company or any other Transferred Entity, or Company Employee except as may
be required by Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA or any other
Applicable Law.

other than the United States (a "Foreign Benefit Plan"): (i) the Foreign
Benefit Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable
Laws, (ii) if intended or required to be qualified, approved or registered
with a Governmental Authority, the Foreign Benefit Plan is and has been so
qualified, approved or registered and the Company is not aware of any event
that could reasonably be expected to result in the loss of such qualification,
approval or registration, as applicable, (iii) if intended to qualify for
special tax treatment, the Foreign Benefit Plan has met all requirements for
such treatment, and (iv) if intended to be funded and/or book reserved
pursuant to the plan terms or Applicable Law, are funded and/or book reserved,
as appropriate, in accordance with the plan terms or Applicable Law (as
applicable).

penalty has been received by Seller, Shareholder, the Company or any other
Transferred Entity, and (ii) there are no judicial, administrative or other
actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Seller,

directly or indirectly related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing (including any flex provisions) other than the conditions

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

precedent set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters and as of the date
hereof, Buyer has no reason to believe that it will not be able to satisfy any
term or condition of closing of the Financing that is required to be satisfied
as a condition of the Financing, or that the full amount of the Financing will
not be made available to Buyer on the Closing Date. Other than the Financing
Commitment Letters, there are no side letters or other contracts, arrangements
or understandings (written or oral) directly or indirectly related to the
Financing (except for customary fee letters and engagement letters relating to
the Debt Financing, a copy of each of which has been provided to Seller prior
to the date hereof, with only the fee amounts redacted, and non-disclosure
agreements relating to the Debt Financing that do not impact the
conditionality or amount of the Financing). Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions to Buyer's obligations to consummate the Closing, the aggregate
proceeds of the Financing are in an amount sufficient to (i) consummate the
Closing upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) pay all other
amounts payable by Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to the other Transaction
Documents to which any such Person is a party and (iii) pay all related fees
and expenses of Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives. Buyer has fully
paid, or caused to be paid, any and all commitment fees and any and all other
fees and expenses, in each case as are required to be paid as of the date
hereof pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitment Letters.

  

  

(c) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the consummation of the Financing shall not be a
condition to the obligation of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 4.06. Solvency. Assuming (i) the satisfaction of the conditions to the
obligation of Buyer to consummate the Closing, (ii) the accuracy in all
material respects of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in
Article 3 of this Agreement and, after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, the payment of the
Aggregate Purchase Price and the payment of all related fees and expenses, and
(iii) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and the
Transferred Entities have been prepared in good faith based on assumptions
that were and continue, as of the date hereof, to be reasonable, the Company
on a consolidated basis will be Solvent immediately after the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Solvent" when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of
determination, (A) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of
such Person will, as of such date, exceed (1) the value of all "liabilities of
such Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as
such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (2)
the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such
Person on its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and matured, (B) such Person will not have, as of such date,
an

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date and (C) such
Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature.

  

  

Section 4.07. Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Buyer has caused Guarantor to deliver to Seller a duly executed guarantee of
Vestar Capital Partners VI, L.P. (the "Guarantor") with respect to certain
matters as, and on the terms, specified therein (the "Guarantee"). The
execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor of the Guarantee and the
consummation by the Guarantor of the transactions contemplated thereby have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary limited partnership action
on the part of the Guarantor. As of the date hereof, the Guarantee is in full
force and effect and is a valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor,
enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms (subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions) and, as of the date hereof, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default on the part of the Guarantor under such Guarantee. The Guarantor and
its Affiliates are the direct or indirect beneficial owners of 100% of all
outstanding capital stock and any other outstanding equity interests of Buyer.

  

  

Section 4.08. Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
action, suit, investigation or proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge
of Buyer as of the date of this Agreement, threatened against or affecting,
Buyer or any of its Affiliates before any arbitrator or any Governmental
Authority which in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent or materially
delay the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party.

  

  

Section 4.09. Investment Advisers Act. Neither Buyer nor, to Buyer's
knowledge, any other Person that is "associated" (as such term is used in
Section 202(a)(17) of the Investment Advisers Act) with the Buyer is
disqualified pursuant to Section 203(e) or 203(f) of the Investment Advisers
Act from serving as an investment adviser or as an associated person to an
investment adviser.

  

  

Section 4.10. Finders' Fees. There is no investment banker, broker, finder or
other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf
of Buyer who may be entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents.

  

  

Section 4.11. Inspections; No Other Representations. Buyer has conducted its
own independent review and analysis of the business, operations, assets,
liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the
Company and the other Transferred Entities and has undertaken such
investigation, and has been provided with and has evaluated such documents and
information as it has requested, to enable it to make an informed and
intelligent

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which Buyer is a party. Buyer
agrees to accept the Shares and the Company (including the other Transferred
Entities) in the condition they are in on the Closing Date based upon their
own inspection, examination and determination with respect thereto as to all
matters and without reliance upon any express or implied representations or
warranties of any nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller, except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Except for the representations and
warranties set forth in Article 3 (as modified by the Seller Disclosure
Schedule), Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) acknowledges and
agrees that no representation or warranty of any kind whatsoever, express or
implied, at law or in equity, is made or shall be deemed to have been made by
or on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates, and Seller hereby disclaims,
and Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby disclaims any
reliance upon, any such representation or warranty, and notwithstanding the
delivery or disclosure to Buyer, or any of its Representatives or Affiliates
of any documentation or other information by Seller or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates with respect to any one or more of the
foregoing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer
acknowledges that Seller makes no representation or warranty except for the
representations and warranties set forth in Article 3 (as modified by the
Seller Disclosure Schedule) with respect to any projections, estimates or
budgets delivered to or made available to Buyer of future revenues, future
results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Transferred Entities or
the future business and operations of the Transferred Entities. Buyer
acknowledges that no employee or representative of Seller or any of its
Affiliates has been authorized to make any statements or representations other
than those specifically contained in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 4.12. Purchase for Investment. Buyer is purchasing the Shares for
investment for its own account and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer has sufficient knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of its investment in the Shares and is capable of bearing
the economic risks of such investment.

Seller shall take, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to take, such
action as is necessary to (i) settle or otherwise eliminate, or cause to be
settled or otherwise eliminated, all Pre-Closing Intercompany Balances (except

aggregate, which balances, if any, shall be included in Closing Working
Capital) and (ii) terminate all Pre-Closing Intercompany Agreements other than
(A) those set forth on Section 5.02 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and (B)
if applicable, any Transaction Documents, in each of clauses (i) and (ii),
effective at or prior to the Closing, in such manner and on such terms as
Seller may determine (including, in the case of Pre-Closing Intercompany
Balances, settlement or elimination thereof for no consideration or for
consideration less than the outstanding balance of such Pre-Closing
Intercompany Balances) and without any further liability of Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) to any Transferred
Entity, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates in connection therewith
(except as provided in the first parenthetical in this Section 5.02); provided
that any such action pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall not cause or result
in any liability to a Transferred Entity as of or following the Closing, for
Taxes or otherwise and, as of and following the Closing, no Transferred Entity
shall have any further liability or obligation with respect to any Pre-Closing
Intercompany Balances (except as provided in the first parenthetical in this
Section 5.02). For the avoidance of

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

doubt, intercompany accounts between and among Transferred Entities shall not
be affected by this provision.

  

  

Section 5.03. Insurance.

  

  

(a) From and after the Closing Date, except as expressly provided for in the
following Section 5.03(b), (i) the Transferred Entities shall cease to be
insured under any insurance policies held by Seller or any of its Affiliates
and shall not have any right to coverage or any other benefit under any such
insurance policies for periods prior to the Closing Date, (ii) Buyer shall be
responsible for securing all insurance policies and coverage it considers
necessary or appropriate for the Transferred Entities and their businesses and
operations and (iii) Buyer agrees not to assert or seek to assert, directly
from any insurer, any rights or claims under any past or current insurance
policy held by Seller or any of its Affiliates under which any Transferred
Entity was insured prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) Buyer shall, following the Closing Date, continue to have the benefits of
any available insurance under the Occurrence-Based Policies to the extent
relating to losses incurred by any Transferred Entity in respect of pre-
Closing occurrences. At Buyer's request and at Buyer's sole cost and expense,
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make and pursue claims
in respect of such losses under the applicable Occurrence-Based Policy and, to
the extent that insurance proceeds in respect of any such claim are recovered
by Seller, shall remit the amount of such proceeds to Buyer promptly after
such recovery; provided that, prior to making any such remittance, Seller
shall be permitted to deduct from such recovered proceeds the amount of any
outstanding and unreimbursed Recovery Costs incurred by Seller or any
Affiliate thereof in respect of the claim or claims to which such proceeds
relate; and provided, further, that, (x) Buyer or the applicable Transferred
Entity shall be fully liable for all uninsured or self-insured amounts in
respect of any such loss or claim and (y) Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller
promptly upon request for all out-of-pocket and documented costs or expenses
incurred by Seller or any Affiliate thereof in connection with making or
pursuing any claim made at Buyer's request pursuant to this Section 5.03,
including the costs of filing a claim and any deductibles, premium increases
or other amounts that are or become payable by Seller or any Affiliate thereof
under such Occurrence-Based Policies as a result of such claims (collectively,
"Recovery Costs"). Nothing in this Section 5.03 shall restrict or prohibit
Seller and its Affiliates from, in their discretion, amending any Occurrence-
Based Policy following the Closing Date; provided that no such amendment shall
reduce or eliminate the coverage otherwise available to the Transferred
Entities thereunder in respect of pre-Closing occurrences. "Occurrence-Based
Policies" means the occurrence-based insurance policies of Seller providing
coverage to the Transferred Entities that are set forth on Section 5.03 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

Section 5.04. Non-solicit; Non-compete.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45

Closing, is employed by such Transferred Entity, and (ii) Buyer shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly hire, employ or solicit for

managing director, in each case in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), who, as
of immediately prior to the Closing, is employed by such Retained Entity,
Seller or such other Affiliate thereof; provided that, in each of clauses (i)
and (ii), the term "solicit for employment" as used in this Section 5.04 shall
not be deemed to include generalized searches for employees through media
advertisements of general circulation, employment search firms, open job fairs
or otherwise; and provided, further, that nothing herein shall be deemed to
prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, on the other hand, from hiring, employing or soliciting for
employment (or causing to be hired, employed or solicited for employment) any
former employee of the Transferred Entities (in the case of Seller and its
Affiliates), or any former employee of Seller and its Affiliates, including
the Retained Entities (in the case of Buyer and its Affiliates), if such
former employee was terminated by the applicable party or its Affiliates at
least six months prior to the hiring, employment or solicitation of such
former employee by the other party or its Affiliates. "Retained Entity" for
this purpose means Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc. and KLD Strategic
Research and Analytics, Inc.

  

  

(b) (i) For a period of five years following the Closing Date, Seller agrees
not to, and shall cause each of its controlled Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly (including as a principal or jointly with others or otherwise),
engage in the business of providing Advisory Services. (ii) For a period of
three years following the Closing Date, Seller agrees not to, and shall cause
each of its controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (including as
a principal or jointly with others or otherwise), engage in the business of
consulting with a client on how to improve such client's governance ratings or
scores. (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) neither Seller nor any of its
controlled Affiliates shall be deemed to be in breach of its obligations
pursuant to Section 5.04(b)(ii) if any client obtains governance ratings,
scores or other products from Seller or its controlled Affiliates, including
the Retained Entities, and uses such products in whole or in part to improve
or otherwise manage its own governance ratings or scores without advice,
assistance or consultation on how to improve such client's governance ratings
or scores from Seller or its controlled Affiliates, including the Retained
Entities, and (B) nothing herein shall prohibit Seller or its controlled
Affiliates from making investments in the ordinary course of business in
Persons engaging in the businesses referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or
(ii), provided that each such investment is a passive investment where Seller

(c) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the covenants in this Section 5.04 are
necessary in order to induce Buyer and Seller to enter into and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and are required by each of them
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that
each of Buyer and Seller would not enter into and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the covenants contained in this Section
5.04. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees that each of the covenants set forth in
this Section 5.04 is reasonable with respect to its scope, duration and
geographic area. If any of the covenants set forth in this Section 5.04 is
held to be unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, such covenants
will be considered divisible with respect to scope, time, and geographic area,
and in such lesser scope, time and geographic area will be effective, binding
and enforceable.

  

  

Section 5.05. Internet Domain Names. As soon as practicable following the
Closing Date, Seller shall assign and transfer or cause to be transferred to
the Company the indicated Internet domain names set forth in Section
3.17(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule in a form reasonably satisfactory

Covenants of Buyer

  

  

Buyer agrees that:

  

  

Section 6.01. Confidentiality. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, treat all nonpublic information of Seller, the Company and

terminate at the Closing only with respect to that portion of the Confidential
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) as relates to the
business, operations and affairs of the Transferred Entities, except for
Sections 5, 6 and 8 of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall terminate at
the Closing in their entirety. If this Agreement is terminated, for any
reason, prior to the Closing, the

Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

Transferred Entity (any such Person, a "Designated Person") in any matter
involving this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, by Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP in connection
with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (the "Current Representation").

  

  

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause the

ARTICLE 7

  

Covenants of Buyer and Seller

  

  

Buyer and Seller agree that:

  

  

Section 7.01. Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances. (a) Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller will use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable under Applicable Law to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as
practicable with any Governmental Authority or other third party all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents
and (ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations,
permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from
any Governmental Authority or other third party that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents. Seller and Buyer agree, and agree to cause
the Company and each Transferred Entity (in the case of Seller, prior to the
Closing, and in the case of Buyer, after the Closing), to execute and deliver
such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and to take
such other actions as may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate or
implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents.

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Buyer and
Seller shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten Business Days of the
date hereof, shall supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act, and shall take all other actions reasonably necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable. All filing fees payable under the HSR Act shall be
shared equally by Buyer and Seller.

  

  

(c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents under the
HSR Act or any other applicable competition law, or if any action, suit,
investigation or proceeding is instituted or threatened by any Governmental
Authority or any private party challenging any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as violating the HSR Act or any other
applicable competition

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

law, Buyer, Seller, Shareholder and the Transferred Entities shall use
reasonable best efforts to promptly resolve such objections. In the event any
claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding by any Governmental
Authority or other Person is commenced which questions the validity or
legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages in
connection therewith, Buyer, Seller and Shareholder agree to cooperate and use
their reasonable best efforts to defend against such claim, action, suit,
investigation or other proceeding and, if an injunction or other order is
issued in any such action, suit or other proceeding, to use reasonable best
efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted, and to cooperate
reasonably regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take any and all actions, including
agreeing to hold separate or to divest any of the businesses, properties or
assets of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the
Transferred Entities and any assets thereof) and to terminate any existing
relationships and contractual rights and obligations, as may be required (i)
by the applicable Governmental Authority in order to resolve such objections
as such Governmental Authority may have to such transactions under the HSR Act
or other applicable competition law, or (ii) by any domestic or foreign court
or other tribunal, in any action, suit, investigation or proceeding
challenging such transactions as violating of the HSR Act or other applicable
competition law, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution,
vacating, lifting, altering or reversal of, any order that has the effect of
restricting, preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents; provided
that, nothing herein shall permit any of the Transferred Entities to agree to
hold separate or otherwise, sell, lease, license, divest or dispose of any
assets, rights, product lines, or businesses, in whole or in part, or to
conduct or limit any aspect of their respective assets or business in any
specified manner, or to permit the foregoing actions without the prior written
consent of Buyer; provided, further, that nothing herein shall require any
Affiliate of Buyer to agree to hold separate or otherwise, sell, lease,
license, divest or dispose of any assets, rights, product lines, or
businesses, in whole or in part.

  

  

Section 7.02. Certain Filings. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with one
another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material
contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in taking such actions or making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and
seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

  

  

Section 7.03. Public Announcements. On or as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof, Seller shall issue a press release substantially in the form of
Exhibit H, and the Company shall issue a press release substantially in the
form of Exhibit I. Before issuing any other press release or making any other
public

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

statement with respect to the Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated thereby, (a) each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
obtain the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (b) each party hereto
agrees to consult with the other party and consider any comments of such party
to any such press release or public statement in good faith; provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall be entitled to issue any press
release or make any public statement that is consistent (including as to
nature and scope) with any press release or public statement previously issued
or made by either party in accordance with this Section 7.03; and provided,
further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may, following
consultation with the other party, make any filing or other public disclosure
or public statement as is required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement
with any national securities exchange to which the disclosing party is
subject, solely to the extent that the disclosing party determines such
disclosure or statement to be required by Applicable Law or listing agreement;
and provided, further, that, following the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates
may provide general information about the subject matter of this Agreement in
connection with their fund raising, marketing, informational or reporting
activities without consultation with Seller.

  

  

Section 7.04. Notices of Certain Events. (a) Each of Seller, Shareholder and
Buyer shall promptly notify the other party of:

  

  

(i) any written notice or other written communication from (A) any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents or (B) any Client;

  

  

(ii) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the other Transaction Documents, or under, or relating to any violation or
possible violation of any Applicable Law; and

  

  

(iii) the commencement of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.12, in the case of
Seller, or Section 4.08, in the case of Buyer.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a party's good faith
failure to comply with this Section 7.04 shall not provide the other party
hereto or any of such other party's Affiliates with a right not to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except, in each case, to the
extent that any other provision of this Agreement would independently provide
such right. No notification provided hereunder shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty of the Seller or Buyer set forth in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of such parties to consummate
the transactions

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to such parties
hereunder.

  

  

Section 7.05. Financing. (a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
such things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the
Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using its reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitment Letters in
accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, (ii) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions contained therein (including the flex provisions) or on other terms
no less favorable, individually or in the aggregate, to Buyer, including with
respect to conditionality, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Buyer in the Financing Commitment Letters and the definitive
agreements for the Debt Financing that are within their control (other than
where failure to do so is a direct result of Seller's or its Affiliates'
failure to provide the information and assistance as set forth in Section
7.05(d) below), (iv) consummate the Debt Financing (including by instructing
the parties to the Debt Commitment Letters to provide the Debt Financing, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein) and (v) enforce its
rights under the Financing Commitment Letters (including by taking enforcement
actions against the lenders and other Persons providing the Financing) at or
prior to the Closing. Buyer shall furnish correct and complete copies of all
definitive agreements entered into by Buyer after the date hereof in relation
to the Financing Commitment Letters to Seller promptly upon their execution
(other than the fees set forth therein, which may be redacted).

  

  

(b) Buyer shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights under, any Financing Commitment
Letter or any definitive agreements related to the Financing and/or substitute
other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of the Financing from
the same or Alternative Financing sources, in each case, without Seller's
prior written consent to the extent such amendments, modifications,
substitutions or waivers would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of cash
proceeds available from the Financing to fund the amounts required to be paid
by Buyer under this Agreement (as compared to the amount of such aggregate
proceeds contemplated under the Financing Commitment Letters as in effect on
the date hereof), (ii) impose new or additional conditions precedent that
would be reasonably expected to (A) prevent, impede or materially delay or
impair the availability of the Financing or the ability of Buyer to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner or (B)
adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Financing Commitment Letters or (iii) be in violation of the
terms of such Financing Commitment Letter. Buyer shall not release or consent
to the termination of the obligations of the lenders and other persons under
the Debt Commitment Letters, except for assignments and replacements of
lenders in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters with
respect to the Debt Financing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Buyer may (without
obtaining Seller's consent) amend, supplement or modify the Debt Commitment
Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the
date hereof, if the addition of such additional parties, individually or in
the aggregate, would not prevent, materially delay or impair the availability
of the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letters or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon any such amendment,
supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment Letters in accordance with
this Section 7.05(b), Buyer shall provide a copy thereof to Seller and
references to "Financing Commitment Letters," "Equity Commitment Letter" and
"Debt Commitment Letters" shall include such documents as permitted to be
amended, supplemented or modified under this Section 7.05(b) and references to
"Financing," "Equity Financing" and "Debt Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters as permitted to be
amended, supplemented or modified under this Section 7.05(b).

  

  

(c) In the event all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions or from the sources contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters for any reason, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller and use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative debt financing from
alternative sources (the "Alternative Financing") upon terms (including any
flex provisions) not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Buyer
than those in the Debt Commitment Letters (and any related fee letter), in an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event
(and, in any event, no later than the Closing Date). In the event any
Alternative Financing is obtained in accordance with this Section 7.05(c),
references to "Debt Financing," "Financing," "Debt Commitment Letters" and
"Financing Commitment Letters" (and other like term in this Agreement) shall
include such Alternative Financing, as applicable.

  

  

(d) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause the
Company and the other Transferred Entities and their respective
Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts to, provide, at Buyer's
sole expense, all cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing as may be reasonably requested by Buyer (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and the other Transferred Entities, prior to the
Closing), including (i) furnishing Buyer and the Debt Financing sources as
promptly as reasonably practicable with historical information relating to the
Company and the other Transferred Entities (including such information which
Buyer has reasonably determined is necessary for the preparation of one or
more information packages regarding the business, operations, financial
projections and prospects of the Company and the other Transferred Entities)
customary for such financing and reasonably necessary for

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

the satisfaction of the obligations and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters, (ii) participation by senior management of the business of
the Transferred Entities in a reasonable number of meetings, due diligence
sessions, presentations, "road shows" and sessions with rating agencies,
including direct contact between senior management (with appropriate seniority
and expertise) and representatives (including accountants) of the Company or
any other Transferred Entity, on the one hand, and the Debt Financing sources,
potential lenders and investors for the Debt Financing, on the other hand,
(iii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing; provided, however, that any private
placement memoranda or prospectuses in relation to debt or equity securities
need not be issued by the Company or any other Transferred Entity, (iv) using
reasonable best efforts to furnish Buyer and its Debt Financing sources with
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and the other
Transferred Entities as may be reasonably requested by Buyer that are
necessary for the satisfaction of the obligations and conditions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letters, (v) using reasonable best efforts to obtain
customary accountants' comfort letters, (vi) assisting in the preparation of,
and executing and delivering, definitive financing documents, including one or
more credit agreements, indentures, guarantee and collateral documents and
customary closing certificates as may be required by the Financing, (vii)
providing authorization letters to the Debt Financing sources authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders and containing a customary
representation that such information as of the date of preparation does not
contain a material misstatement or omission, (viii) providing all customary
documentation and other information about the Transferred Entities as is
reasonably requested by the Debt Financing source for the Debt Financing and
required under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act, (ix) cooperating reasonably
with the Debt Financing sources' due diligence, to the extent customary and
reasonable and to the extent not unreasonably interfering with the business of
the Company, (x) facilitating the provision of customary closing documents as
may be reasonably requested by Buyer and (xi) facilitating the provision of
any pledge and security documents and otherwise facilitating the pledging of
collateral immediately after the Closing, including using reasonable best
efforts to obtain such documentation and/or taking such other steps (including
lien searches) reasonably requested by Buyer in order to release all
encumbrances over the properties and assets of the Transferred Entities
securing obligations under the financing documents and, to the extent
necessary, using reasonable best efforts to obtain surveys and title insurance
as reasonably requested by Buyer; provided that the Company and the other
Transferred Entities shall not be required to enter into any such document or
instrument contemplated by the foregoing clauses (other than the authorization
letters referred to above) prior to the Closing; provided, further, that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including this Section 7.05), (A) nothing in this Agreement

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(including this Section 7.05) shall require any such cooperation to the extent
that it would (1) require the Company or any of the other Transferred Entities
to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any commitment
or other fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Closing, or incur any
liability or give any indemnities or otherwise commit to take any action that
is not contingent upon the Closing, (2) unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing business or operations of the Company and the other Transferred
Entities prior to the Closing, (3) require the Company or any of the other
Transferred Entities to take any action that will conflict with or violate the
Company's or any of the other Transferred Entities organizational documents or
any Applicable Law or result in the contravention of, or that would reasonably
be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any
contract to which the Company or any of the other Transferred Entities is a
party; provided that in the event that the Company or any of the other
Transferred Entities do not provide information in reliance on this Section
7.05(d)(xi)(A)(3), Seller shall provide notice to the Buyer that such
information is being withheld and Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to communicate (or to cause the Company or such other Transferred
Entity to communicate) to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a
way that would not violate the applicable obligation, (4) require the Company
or any of the other Transferred Entities to enter into or approve any
financing or purchase agreement for the Financing prior to the Closing, or (5)
result in any officer or director of the Company or any of its the other
Transferred Entities incurring any personal liability with respect to any
matters relating to the Financing, (B) no action, liability or obligation of
the Company or any of its the other Transferred Entities or any of their
respective Representatives under any certificate, agreement, arrangement,
document or instrument relating to the Debt Financing (other than the
authorization letters referred to above) shall be effective until the Closing,
(C) none of the Company or any of its other Transferred Entities or any of
their respective Representatives shall have any liability or incur any losses,
damages or penalties with respect to any road shows, ratings agencies
presentations, preparation of documents (including rating agency presentation,
bank information memoranda or other offer documents in connection with the
Debt Financing) and provision of information with respect to the prospects and
plans for the Company's business and operations in connection with the Debt
Financing or be required to provide any information or make any presentations
with respect to capital structure, or the incurrence of the Debt Financing or
other pro forma information relating thereto or the manner in which Buyer
intends to operate or cause to be operated, the business of the Company and
the other Transferred Entities after the Closing and (D) Buyer shall reimburse
the Company or cause the Company to be reimbursed for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the reasonable and

Company or any of the other Transferred Entities in connection with the
actions and cooperation pursuant to this Section 7.05. Buyer shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, the other Transferred Entities and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,

judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing (including any action taken in accordance with
this Section 7.05(d)) and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than historical information relating to the Company or the other
Transferred Entities or other information furnished by the Company or the
other Transferred Entities). All material non-public information regarding the
Company and the other Transferred Entities provided to Buyer and its
representatives and Affiliates pursuant to this Section 7.05(d) shall be kept

event prior to the Closing, the unaudited interim statement of financial
condition as of March 31, 2014 and the related unaudited interim statement of
income and cash flows and changes of equity for the three months ended March
31, 2014 of the Transferred Entities.

  

  

(e) Buyer shall give Seller prompt notice (i) of any breach or default (or any
event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any
party to any Financing Commitment Letter or definitive document related to the
Financing, (ii) of the receipt of any written notice from any party to any
Financing Commitment Letters with respect to any actual breach, default,
withdrawal, termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing

related to the Financing, (iii) of any material written dispute or

Lease, and shall, as of the Closing, cause the Company or other Transferred
Entity to assign to Seller (or any Affiliate thereof, other than the Company
or any other Transferred Entity, designated by Seller) each Retained Real
Property Lease (or sublease the premises demised by any Retained Real Property
Lease) with respect to which such consent has been obtained or no consent is
required. With respect to any Retained Real Property Lease as to which consent
is required for assignment (or, if applicable, subleasing) but not obtained
prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such consent following the Closing Date for a period of six months and
Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate to cause the assignment of such Retained Real Property Lease (or
subleasing of the premises demised under such Retained Real Property Lease) to
Seller promptly after any such consent is received, including by execution of
such other instruments of assignment (or subleases) or consent or any other
actions reasonably requested by Seller as may be necessary to assign to Seller
any Retained Real Property Lease (or subleasing of the premises demised under
such Retained Real Property Lease). With respect to any Retained Real Property
Lease as to which consent is required for assignment (or sublease) but not
obtained prior to the Closing, the premises demised under such Retained Real
Property Lease shall be removed from the "Facilities" section of Schedule A to
the Transition Services Agreement, and added to the "Facilities" section of
Schedule B to the Transition Services Agreement on the terms set forth in
Section 7.07(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule with respect to such
Retained Real Property Lease, and from and after the Closing, for so long as
such consent has not been obtained, such premises shall be deemed to be a
"Premises" and "Licensed Space" made available by Buyer, as the Provider
Entity, to Seller, as the Recipient Entity (in each case, as such terms are
defined in the Transition Services Agreement), under and in accordance with
the terms of the Transition Services Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 7.07(b), none of Seller, the Company or any other Transferred
Entity shall be required, either prior to or following the Closing, to pay any
money, grant any concession or provide any other consideration to any Person
in order to obtain any such consents to effect the assignment of any Retained
Real Property Leases or releases of the Company or Transferred Entity (or
subleasing of the premises demised under such Retained Real Property Lease);
provided, that without limiting Buyer's obligations under this Section
7.07(b), if a necessary consent to an assignment or sublease shall not have
been obtained with respect to the Retained Real Property Lease for space

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

located in Paris, France, Seller shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
for all Damages actually incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party to the extent
arising out of Buyer's obligations as tenant under such lease in respect of
the period from and after the Closing Date; provided, further, that such
Damages shall not include any amount that could reasonably have been avoided
by reasonable mitigation efforts of any Buyer Indemnified Party and Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate any such potential Damages
in consultation with Seller.

  

  

Section 7.08. Client Consents. (a) If consent or other action is required by
Applicable Law or by the Investment Advisory Agreement of any Client for the
Investment Advisory Agreement with such Client to continue after Closing, as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall, or shall cause the appropriate Subsidiary to, send a notice ("Consent
Notice") complying with Applicable Law and the terms of such Client's
Investment Advisory Agreement informing such Client of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and requesting such consent in writing and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such consent, and, from the
date hereof to the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and
the other Transferred Entities to, thereafter use their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain such consent; provided that Seller's, the Company's and
the other Transferred Entities' obligations under this Section 7.08(a) shall
be deemed satisfied with respect to any Client if such Client's consent is
deemed to be given pursuant to Section 7.08(b).

  

  

(b) The Buyer and Seller agree that any consent required for any Investment
Advisory Agreement with a Client to continue after the Closing shall be deemed
given for all purposes under this Agreement (i) upon receipt of a written
consent requested in the Consent Notice prior to the Closing Date or (ii) if
no such written consent is received, if 45 days shall have passed since the
sending of written notice ("Negative Consent Notice") to such Client (which
Negative Consent Notice may be included in the Consent Notice sent to such
Client) requesting written consent as aforesaid and informing such Client: (A)
of the intention to complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
which will result in a deemed assignment of such Client's Investment Advisory
Agreement; (B) of the Company's (or the applicable Transferred Entities')
intention to continue to provide the advisory services pursuant to the
existing Investment Advisory Agreement with such Client after the Closing if
such Client does not terminate such agreement prior to the Closing; and (C)
that the consent of such Client will be deemed to have been granted if such
Client continues to accept such advisory services for a period of at least 45
days after the sending of the Negative Consent Notice without termination;
provided that if the parties mutually reasonably determine that written
consent is required under Applicable Law or the respective Investment Advisory
Agreement, such consent shall be deemed given only upon receipt of the written
consent requested in the Consent Notice prior to the Closing Date; provided,
further, that, in any case, no consent

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

shall be deemed to have been given for any purpose under this Agreement if at
any time prior to the Closing such Client notifies the Company or the other
Transferred Entity in writing that such Client has not so consented or has
terminated, or given notice of termination of its Investment Advisory
Agreement, and in each case such notice has not been revoked.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
all consent materials to be used by Seller prior to distribution.

  

  

(d) Seller agrees that the information that is contained in any Consent Notice
or Negative Consent Notice to be furnished to any Client (other than
information that is or will be provided in writing by or on behalf of Buyer or
its Affiliates for inclusion in such Consent Notice or Negative Consent
Notice) will be true, correct and complete in all material respects. Buyer
agrees that the information provided by it or its Affiliates (or on their
behalves) in writing for inclusion in any Consent Notice or Negative Consent
Notice will be true, correct and complete in all material respects.

  

  

(e) In connection with obtaining the Client consents required by this Section
7.08, at all times prior to the Closing, Seller shall keep Buyer informed of
the status of obtaining such Client and other consents and, upon Buyer's
request, make available to Buyer copies of all such executed Client or other
consents. In addition, prior to entering into a new Investment Advisory
Agreement with any Client, Seller shall, or shall instruct the applicable
Transferred Entity to, inform each potential Client or counterparty to such
agreement of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and use its reasonable best efforts to include
in the applicable contract a provision disclosing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the consent of the potential Client or
counterparty thereto (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law).

  

  

Section 7.09. Access to Information; Retention; Confidentiality. (a) From the
date hereof until the Closing Date (or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement), and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement,
Seller will (i) give, and will cause the Company and each other Transferred
Entity to give, Buyer, its counsel and other Representatives reasonable access
to the properties, books and records of the Transferred Entities, the books
and records of Seller (or portion thereof) to the extent relating to the
Transferred Entities, and to the employees and independent accountants of the
Transferred Entities, (ii) furnish, and will cause the Transferred Entities to
furnish, to Buyer, its counsel and other Representatives such financial and
operating data and other information relating to the Transferred Entities as
such Persons may reasonably request and (iii) instruct the employees,
independent accountants, counsel and financial advisors of Seller or the
Transferred Entities to cooperate with Buyer in its investigation of the
Transferred Entities.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(b) From and after the Closing Date until the fifth anniversary of the
Closing, and subject to Applicable Law, (i) each party shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, afford to the other party and its Representatives
reasonable access to all books and records (or portions thereof) to the extent
relating to the Transferred Entities that are in such party's or its
Affiliates' possession as of the Closing Date and (ii) Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Company and each other Transferred Entity to, afford to Seller
reasonable access to the employees and independent accountants of the
Transferred Entities, and will instruct such employee and independent
accountants to cooperate with Seller and its Representatives, in each of
clauses (i) and (ii) to the extent that party requesting such access
reasonably required solely in connection with its tax, regulatory or
litigation (except litigation involving a party to this Agreement or one or
more of their Affiliates) matters (in case, relating to Seller's prior
ownership of the Transferred Entities). Seller will hold, and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to hold, in
confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial process or by other
requirements of Applicable Law or pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange to which Seller is subject, all confidential
documents and information concerning the Company or any other Transferred
Entity provided to it pursuant to this Section 7.09, provided that prior to
any such disclosure, Seller shall give Buyer prior written notice thereof, and
reasonably cooperate with Buyer's efforts to limit or prevent any such
disclosure, or otherwise have confidential treatment afforded to such
information.

  

  

(c) Each party shall only be required to grant access to the other party
pursuant to the preceding clauses (a) and (b) during normal business hours in
such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business
of such party and, if applicable, its Affiliates.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
Section 7.09 shall require (A) Seller (prior to the Closing Date) or Buyer
(following the Closing Date) to provide the other party or its Representatives
with access to (i) personnel records of the Transferred Entities relating to
individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
information which, in the disclosing party's good faith opinion, is sensitive
or the disclosure of which could subject the Transferred Entities to risk of
liability or (ii) information the disclosure of which, in the disclosing
party's good faith opinion (x) would conflict with confidentiality obligations
to which such party or any Transferred Entity is bound or (y) would reasonably
be expected to result in the forfeiture or waiver of any attorney-client or
similar privilege, provided that, in the case of this clause (y), the
disclosing party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
other party, to the extent possible, with access to the relevant information
in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to result in the forfeiture
or waiver of any such attorney-client or similar privilege, or (B) either
party's independent accountants to make available to the other party or its
Representatives any work papers unless and until such Person has signed a
customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access
to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent
accountants.

  

  

(e) Through the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause the Transferred
Entities to, preserve and maintain the books and records of the Transferred
Entities in all material respects in the same manner and same care that the
books and records of the Transferred Entities have been maintained prior to
the execution of this Agreement. At the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, deliver to Buyer or its designee, or cause the Transferred
Entities to have possession of, (i) all original corporate records of the
Transferred Entities, including any such corporate records relating to the
Transferred Entities' legal existence, stock or other equity ownership and
corporate governance and (ii) the physical or electronic embodiments of all
permits, licenses, certificates, approvals and authorizations from
Governmental Authorities then held by the Transferred Entities.

  

  

(f) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall enter into an
assignment agreement, pursuant to which Seller assigns to Buyer its rights
under each Pre-Closing Confidentiality Agreement solely with respect to the
confidential information of the Transferred Entities, to the extent such
rights under the Pre-Closing Confidentiality Agreements are assignable, and
deliver a copy of each such agreement and assignment thereof to Buyer. Seller
shall, or shall cause the Company to, request that all third parties who
executed a Pre-Closing Confidentiality Agreement in connection with the
consideration of a transaction involving the Company return to the Company, or
destroy, all confidential information of the Transferred Entities heretofore
furnished to such third party by or on behalf of each of Seller or any of its
Affiliates, including the Company, as promptly as practicable, subject to the
terms of such agreements.

  

  

Section 7.10. Shared Contracts. The parties hereto acknowledge that Seller and
its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) are parties to certain
contracts and agreements set forth on Section 7.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules that relate to the operations or conduct of the business of one or
more of the Transferred Entities, but which will remain with Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) after the Closing. In the
case of those contracts set forth on Section 7.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (collectively, the "Shared Contracts"), the parties shall cooperate
with each other and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
(which shall not require any party hereto to pay any money, grant any
concession or provide any other consideration to any Person in connection
therewith) to obtain the agreement of the third party that is the counterparty
to each Shared Contract to enter into a new contract effective as of the
Closing Date pursuant to which a Transferred Entity will receive substantially
the same services provided under the Shared Contract to such Transferred
Entity prior to the Closing on terms and conditions substantially similar to
those contained in the Shared Contract as of the Closing Date (each, a
"Replacement Contract"). If a Replacement Contract is

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

not entered into with respect to any Shared Contract prior to the Closing
Date, Seller agrees to continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts for
a period of six months from and after the Closing Date to cause the
counterparty to such Shared Contract to enter into a Replacement Contract,
provided that during such six-month period, Seller and its Affiliates shall
provide Buyer and the Transferred Entities with the benefits of such Shared
Contracts pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement at no additional cost
to Buyer or the Transferred Entities. If a Replacement Contract has not been
obtained after the six month period, then, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to secure an arrangement reasonably satisfactory to both parties under
which the Transferred Entities would, in compliance with Applicable Law,
obtain the benefits associated with the applicable Shared Contracts, which
arrangement may include Seller and its Affiliates providing the Transferred
Entities with such benefits for a transitional period reasonably acceptable to
both parties pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, (i) in no event shall any Replacement Contract impose any
obligations or liability on Seller or its Affiliates after the Closing and
(ii) in no event shall the execution of any Replacement Contract constitute a
condition to the obligation of Buyer to consummate the Closing on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.11. Termination of Certain Employee Plans. Effective prior to the
Closing, Seller or the Company (as the case may be) shall terminate (solely
with respect to Transferred Entity service providers) the Employee Plans set
forth in Section 7.11 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

Section 7.12. Additional Payments Received. After the Closing, each of Seller
and Buyer covenants and agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Affiliates,
to promptly (and in any event within five Business Days) transfer and deliver
to the other party, from time to time as and when received by it or its
Subsidiaries, any cash, checks with appropriate endorsements (using its
reasonable efforts not to convert such checks into cash) or other property
that it (or any of its Affiliates) receives which is a payment from a client
or customer that is incorrectly addressed to, in the case of Seller, Seller or
any of its Affiliates, and in the case of Buyer, the Transferred Entities, and
will account to such other party for all such receipts.

  

  

Section 7.13. ISS Europe Loan and ISS Australia Loan. Buyer agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause:

  

  

(a) (i) ISS Europe to cancel all or a portion of the ISS Europe Loan, by way
of a distribution of the ISS Europe Loan, or (ii) the Company to repay all or
a portion of the ISS Europe Loan, followed by a distribution to the Company of
the same amount, in either case to the extent ISS Europe is permitted under
Applicable Law to make a distribution in each fiscal year of ISS Europe that
ends after the Closing Date;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(b) (i) ISS Australia to cancel all or a portion of the ISS Australia Loan, by
way of a distribution of the ISS Australia Loan, or (ii) the Company to repay
all or a portion of the ISS Australia Loan, followed by a distribution to the
Company of the same amount, in either case to the extent ISS Australia is
permitted under Applicable Law to make a distribution in each fiscal year of
ISS Australia that ends after the Closing Date; and

  

  

(c) each of ISS Europe and ISS Australia to satisfy all legal requirements
under Applicable Law in order to permit distributions to be made in the
ordinary course.

  

  

Section 7.14. Expungement of Confidential Information. Except as required by
Applicable Law and/or internal record-keeping policies or procedures, within
30 days after the Closing Date, (i) Seller shall cause the Retained Entities
to expunge from the Retained Entities' production files all copies of
confidential information and data, proprietary software and code, and other
tangible intellectual property ("Pre-Closing Confidential Information") of the
Transferred Entities in any form, that is within their possession, power,
custody or control, (ii) Buyer shall cause the Transferred Entities to expunge
from the Transferred Entities' production files all copies of Pre-Closing
Confidential Information of Seller and its controlled Affiliates in any form,
that is within their possession, power, custody or control and (iii) Seller
shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to, and Buyer shall, and
shall cause its controlled Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to expunge or return all other Pre-Closing
Confidential Information of the other party or its controlled Affiliates that
is within their possession, power, custody or control; provided that neither
party nor their respective controlled Affiliates need return or destroy any
electronic records or files containing Pre-Closing Confidential Information
that have been created pursuant to such Person's automatic electronic back-up
procedures in the ordinary course of business that cannot be reasonably
deleted, and each Party may retain and continue to use Pre-Closing
Confidential Information if it is embodied in a published report intended for
third parties or it is otherwise made available as of the Closing Date by such
party as part of any other commercial offering (it being understood that if
any Pre-Closing Confidential Information is provided to third parties after
the Closing Date, it shall be in substantially the same form as provided as of
the Closing Date). Upon the request of the other party, each party shall
certify that it has complied with its obligations under this Section 7.14.

Tax Matters

  

  

Section 8.01. Tax Covenants.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(a) Buyer covenants that it will not cause or permit any Transferred Entity or
any Affiliate of Buyer (i) to take any action on the Closing Date (including
but not limited to the distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of any
redemption that could give rise to any Tax liability or reduce any Tax Asset
of the Seller Group or give rise to any loss of the Seller or the Seller Group
under this Agreement) other than in the ordinary course of business or as
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (ii) to make any election or
deemed election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) to, with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, make or change any Tax election or amend any Tax Return.

  

  

(b) (i) Seller shall (A) prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to
be filed all Tax Returns for the Transferred Entities (or that relate to the
Transferred Entities) that are required to be filed on or before the Closing
Date and timely pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns and (B) prepare
or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns that
relate to Combined Taxes and timely pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax
Returns.

  

  

(ii) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns for the
Transferred Entities that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and are required
to be filed after the Closing Date that (A) are not filed on a combined or
consolidated basis (other than with another Transferred Entity) ("Separate
Returns") and (B) that relate to Income Taxes (such Tax Returns described in
(A) and (B), "Separate Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns") in a manner consistent
with the past practices of Seller and the Transferred Entities. Seller shall
deliver to Buyer, no later than 20 days prior to the earlier of the due date
(taking into account extensions) for the filing of such Separate Pre-Closing
Income Tax Return and the date such Separate Pre-Closing Income Tax Return is
actually filed, a draft of such Separate Pre-Closing Income Tax Return for
review by Buyer, and Seller shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments made by Buyer. No later than two Business Days prior to the due date
for filing each such Separate Pre-Closing Income Tax Return, Seller shall pay
to Buyer in cash an amount equal to all Taxes payable with respect to such
Separate Pre-Closing Income Tax Return to the extent that any Taxes shown as
due and payable on any such Separate Pre-Closing Income Tax Return were not
included in determining Closing Working Capital. Buyer shall timely file, or
cause to be timely filed, each such Separate Pre-Closing Income Tax Return and
shall timely pay, or cause to be timely paid, all Taxes payable with respect
to each such Separate Pre-Closing Income Tax Return.

  

  

(iii) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Separate Returns that
are required to be filed after the Closing Date that (A) relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period and do not relate to Income Taxes and (B) that relate to a
Straddle Tax Period, in each case in a manner consistent

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

with the past practices of Seller and the Transferred Entities. Buyer shall
deliver to Seller, no later than 20 days prior to the earlier of the due date
(taking into account extensions) for the filing of such Tax Return and the
date such Tax Return is actually filed, a draft of such Tax Return for review
by Seller and Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any
disagreements prior to the required due date for filing such Tax Return. If
the parties are unable to resolve all open issues with respect to any such Tax
Return, such open issues shall be referred to a Referee no later than five
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return. If the Referee is not
able to resolve any such issues before the filing due date, such Tax Return
shall be finalized and filed in the manner proposed by Buyer. No later than
two Business Days prior to the due date for filing each such Tax Return,
Seller shall pay to Buyer in cash an amount equal to the Taxes shown as due
and payable with respect to such Tax Return to the extent related to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and not included in determining Closing Working Capital.
Buyer shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed, each such Tax Return and
shall timely pay, or cause to be timely paid, all Taxes payable with respect
to each such Tax Return. If the Referee subsequently determines that a Tax
Return described in this paragraph was filed incorrectly, Buyer shall file an
amended Tax Return and Buyer shall pay to Seller in cash an amount equal to
all excess Taxes paid by Seller with respect to such Tax Return.

  

  

(iv) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns for (or with respect to) the Transferred Entities that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date that relate to a Tax period
beginning after the Closing Date, and shall timely pay, or cause to be timely
paid, all Taxes payable with respect to each such Tax Return.

  

  

(c) Seller shall include the Transferred Entities in any Tax Return for
Combined Taxes through the close of business on the Closing Date.

  

  

(d) Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Seller all refunds of
Seller Indemnified Taxes and interest thereon received by Buyer, any Affiliate
of Buyer, or any of Transferred Entities attributable to Taxes paid by Seller,
or any of Transferred Entities (or any predecessor or Affiliate of Seller)
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, for avoidance of doubt,
all refunds of Taxes previously paid by Seller, its Affiliates, the Company or
any other Transferred Entity in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period). If, in
lieu of receiving any such refund of Seller Indemnified Taxes, any Transferred
Entity actually receives a Tax credit that reduces a Tax liability with
respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be
paid to Seller the amount of such reduction in Tax liability; provided that,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Buyer may not elect to receive a
Tax credit in lieu of receiving any such refund in cash unless Buyer
reasonably determines that electing to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

receive any such refund in cash would adversely affect the Buyer, any
Affiliate of Buyer or any of the Transferred Entities. For the avoidance of
doubt, any refunds or credits of Taxes shall be for the account of Buyer to
the extent (A) such refunds or credits of Taxes are attributable to the
carryback from a Post-Closing Tax Period of items of loss, deduction or
credit, or other Tax items of Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any of the
Transferred Entities, or (B) such refunds or credits of Taxes were included in
determining the Closing Working Capital. Any refunds of Taxes of the
Transferred Entities with respect to any Straddle Period shall be apportioned
between Seller and Buyer in accordance with Section 8.05(d). If subsequent to
the payment by Buyer to Seller of any amount pursuant to this Section 8.01(d),
there shall be a Final Determination which results in a disallowance or a
reduction in such refund or credit of Tax that gave rise to such payment,
Seller shall repay to Buyer, within 30 days of receipt of notice of such Final
Determination, an amount equal to such disallowance or reduction.

  

  

(e) (i) All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any real property transfer Tax and
any similar Tax and expenses incurred in filing any Tax Returns for such
Transfer Taxes) shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller when due. Buyer
will file all necessary Tax Returns with respect to all such Taxes, and, if
required by Applicable Law, Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates to,
cooperate in preparing and filing and join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns. Seller shall pay its portion of the Transfer Taxes to Buyer two
Business Days prior to the due date for such Transfer Taxes.

  

  

Section 8.02. Tax Sharing. Seller shall cause any and all existing Tax Sharing
Agreements (including any such agreements between the Transferred Entities and
any member of the Seller Group, other than this Agreement) to be terminated as
of the Closing Date with respect to the Transferred Entities. Seller shall
ensure that after such date none of the Transferred Entities, Seller nor any
Affiliate of Seller shall have any further rights, obligations or liabilities
thereunder. From and after the Closing Date, this Agreement shall be the sole
Tax Sharing Agreement relating to the Transferred Entities for all Pre-Closing
Tax Periods.

  

  

Section 8.03. Cooperation on Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party (including prior to the Closing Date),
in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return (including any
report required pursuant to Section 6043A of the Code and all Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder), any audit, litigation or other proceeding
or matter with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other party's reasonable request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees reasonably available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

  

hereunder. Buyer and Seller agree (i) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Transferred Entities until the
expiration of any applicable statute of limitations, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority for all
periods required by such Taxing Authority, and (ii) to use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the other party with at least thirty (30) days'
prior written notice before destroying any such books and records prior to the
expiration of any applicable statute of limitations, during which period the
party receiving the notice can elect to take possession, at its own expense,
of such books and records.

  

  

(b) Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
governmental authority or customer of the Transferred Entities or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed (including but not limited to with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby).

  

  

Section 8.04. [RESERVED].

  

  

Section 8.05. Tax Indemnification. (a) Seller agrees that Buyer is to have no
liability for any (i) Tax of the Company or any of the other Transferred
Entities related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) liability for the payment
of any amount of the type described in clause (i) as a result of being or
having been before the Closing a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group for Taxes (including the Seller Group), (iii) Tax
arising from a breach by Seller of any covenant or agreement contained in
Article 8, (iv) any Taxes (net of any related foreign Tax credits actually
used by the Transferred Entities) attributable to amounts includable in income
under Subpart F of the Code that is attributable to the income and operations
of the Foreign Subsidiaries during a Pre-Closing Tax Period, which shall be
determined by assuming that the Tax years of the Foreign Subsidiaries closed
on the Closing Date, and (v) ISS Foreign Loan Taxes, and Seller agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Buyer Tax Indemnified Party against
any such Tax (together with any interest, penalty, addition to Tax or
additional amount), (any Tax described in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), a
"Seller Indemnified Tax") and (vi) any costs and expenses (including
reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees and expenses),
arising out of or incident to the imposition, defense, assessment or assertion
of any Seller Indemnified Tax (any amount described in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv),
(v) or (vi), a "Seller Indemnified Tax Loss"); provided that Seller shall have
no liability for the payment of any Seller Indemnified Tax Loss (w)
attributable to or resulting from any action described in Section 8.01(a),
including an election made by Buyer under Section 338 of the Code or any
comparable provision of Applicable Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (x) for which Buyer is otherwise required to
indemnify Seller under Section 8.05(b), (y) to the extent that such Seller
Indemnified Tax Loss is reflected in the calculation of Closing Working
Capital or (z) in respect of ISS Foreign Loan Taxes (I) in excess

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

  

of $ 2,000,000, or (II) for any Tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2020
(each of (w), (x), (y) and (z), a "Seller Indemnified Tax Loss Limitation").

  

  

(b) Buyer agrees that Seller is to have no liability for (i) any Tax resulting
from the breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer
contained in this Article 8 or (ii) any Taxes of Buyer or any Transferred
Entity for a Post-Closing Tax Period (other than any Taxes (y) described in
Section 8.05(a)(iii) through Section 8.05(a)(v), or (z) resulting from a
misrepresentation or breach of a Post-Closing Tax Representation), and Buyer
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Tax Indemnified Party
against any such Tax (together with any interest, penalty, addition to Tax or
additional amount) (any Tax described in (i) or (ii), a "Buyer Indemnified
Tax"), and (iii) any costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees and expenses) arising
out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any Buyer
Indemnified Tax (any amount described in (i), (ii) or (iii), a "Buyer
Indemnified Tax Loss").

  

  

(c) The amount of any indemnification payment made under this Section 8.05 by
the party making an indemnification payment under Section 8.05 (the "Tax
Indemnifying Party") shall be net of any Tax Savings realized by the party
receiving such payment (the "Tax Indemnified Party") arising from the
incurrence of the event giving rise to such payment or payment of any
indemnification payment with respect thereto. For purposes hereof, "Tax
Savings" means, with respect to any event for which an indemnification payment
is made under Section 8.05, an amount by which the net Tax liability of the
Tax Indemnified Party (or a group filing a Tax Return that includes such Tax
Indemnified Party) is actually reduced in, or prior to, the year the
Indemnified Tax Loss is incurred as a result of the Indemnified Tax Loss or
the amount of Tax refund that is generated as a result of such Indemnified Tax
Loss in, or prior to, the year the Indemnified Tax Loss is incurred, and any
related interest received from the applicable Taxing Authority in, or prior
to, the year the Indemnified Tax Loss is incurred. If the Tax Indemnified
Party receives any net Tax Savings subsequent to an indemnification payment by
the Tax Indemnifying Party, then such Tax Indemnified Party shall pay to the
Tax Indemnifying Party the amount of such net Tax Savings up the amount
received by the Tax Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such
Tax Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

  

  

(d) For purposes of this Article 8, in the case of any Taxes (other than
Transfer Taxes) that are payable for a Straddle Tax Period, the portion of
such Tax related to the portion of such Tax period ending on and including the
Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than gross receipts,
sales or use Taxes and Taxes based upon or related to income, be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Tax period, and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income and any gross
receipts, sales or use Tax, shall equal the portion of such Tax that would
have been payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing
Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the allocation set forth
in the foregoing clause (y) shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the Company and the other Transferred Entities.

  

  

(e) (i) Each party agrees to give prompt notice to the other party of any
Indemnified Tax Loss or the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any
suit, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought under
this Section 8.05 (specifying with reasonable particularity the basis
therefor) and will give the potential Tax Indemnifying Party such information
with respect thereto as the potential Tax Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request; provided that the failure to give such notice as provided in this
Section 8.05(e) shall not relieve the potential Tax Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under Section 8.05, except to the extent such failure shall have
actually and materially prejudiced the Tax Indemnifying Party. The Tax
Indemnifying Party may discharge, at any time, any indemnification obligation
under Section 8.05 by paying to the Tax Indemnified Party the amount payable
pursuant to this Section 8.05, calculated on the date of such payment.

  

  

(ii) Other than with respect to a suit, action or proceeding (including Tax
audits) (a "Tax Claim") in respect of Income Taxes relating to a Straddle Tax
Period, the Tax Indemnifying Party may, at its own expense, (a) participate in
any Tax Claim and (b) with respect to any Tax Claim that relates solely to
Buyer Indemnified Taxes where Buyer is the Tax Indemnifying Party or solely to
Seller Indemnified Taxes where Seller is the Tax Indemnifying Party, assume
the defense of any such Tax Claim; provided that where the Tax Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of a Tax Claim pursuant to (b) of this paragraph,
(i) the Tax Indemnifying Party's counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Tax
Indemnified Party, (ii) the Tax Indemnifying Party shall thereafter keep Tax
Indemnified Party reasonably informed and consult in good faith with the Tax
Indemnified Party upon the Tax Indemnified Party reasonable request for such
consultation from time to time with respect to such suit, action or proceeding
(including any Tax audit) and (iii) the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the Tax Indemnified Party's consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, agree to any settlement with respect to any
Tax if such settlement could adversely affect the Tax liability of the Tax
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. Where the Tax Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense pursuant to (b) of this paragraph, the Tax Indemnified
Party shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense
thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, will not be an Indemnified Tax Loss), separate from the counsel
employed by the Tax Indemnifying Party. The Tax Indemnified Party shall not
settle any suit,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought, or make
payment on account of any Indemnified Tax Loss, hereunder without the consent
of the Tax Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Whether or not the Tax Indemnifying Party chooses to
defend or prosecute any claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in
the defense or prosecution thereof.

  

  

(iii) With respect to a Tax Claim in respect of Income Taxes relating to a
Straddle Tax Period, (A) Buyer and Seller shall, in good faith, jointly
control the defense of such Tax Claim with respect to any item that relates to
both a Pre-Closing Tax Period and a Post-Closing Tax Period, and neither
Seller nor Buyer shall agree to any settlement without consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (B)
control over any claims with respect to any item that relates solely to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be governed by the provisions of Section 8.05(e)(ii).

  

  

(f) Any claim of any Buyer Tax Indemnified Party under this Section 8.05 may
be made and enforced by Buyer on behalf of such Buyer Tax Indemnified Party
and any claim of any Seller Tax Indemnified Party may be enforced by Seller on
behalf of such Seller Tax Indemnified Party.

  

  

Section 8.06. Certain Disputes. Disputes that arise under this Article 8 and
are not resolved by mutual agreement within 30 days shall be resolved by a
nationally recognized expert in the relevant area with no material
relationship with Buyer, Seller or their Affiliates (the "Referee"), chosen
and mutually acceptable to both Buyer and Seller within five days of the date
on which the need to choose the Referee arises. The Referee shall resolve any
disputed items within 30 days of having the item referred to it pursuant to
such procedures as it may require. The costs, fees and expenses of the Referee
shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

  

  

Section 8.07. Purchase Price Adjustment. Any amount paid by Seller or Buyer
under Article 8 or Article 11 will be treated as an adjustment to the
Aggregate Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

  

  

Section 8.08. Survival. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the covenants and agreements contained in Article 8 shall survive
for the full period of all statutes of limitations (giving effect to any
waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).

  

  

  

ARTICLE 9

  

Employee Benefits

  

  

Section 9.01. Employees. (a) Buyer shall (or shall cause its Affiliates to)
make a Qualifying Offer to each Company Employee, who is not employed by

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

  

  

any of the Transferred Entities, listed in Section 9.01(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (each, an "Offered Employee") who is employed as of
immediately prior to the Closing, with such offers effective as of the
Closing. Not more than 20 and not less than 10 days prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall provide Buyer with a true and correct copy of an updated version
of Section 9.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, which shall reflect any
terminations of employment, new employee hires and other relevant employee
information (which schedule, for the avoidance of doubt, shall contain for
each new employee, all of the information required to be included with respect
to employees listed on Section 3.20(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule).
Offered Employees who are employed include any Offered Employee who is,
immediately prior to the Closing, absent from work on account of use of paid
time-off, disability, medical leave or other leave of absence, or for whom an
obligation to recall or otherwise return to employment exists under Applicable
Law. For purposes hereof, "Qualifying Offer" shall mean an offer of employment
providing for employment on terms consistent with those described in Section
9.02(a).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the extent that it can be
accommodated in accordance with Applicable Law, an Offered Employee who is not
an active employee as of the Closing Date by virtue of receiving disability
benefits, being on a medical leave or other leave of absence (each such
individual, a "Delayed Transfer Employee") shall remain an employee of Seller
or its Affiliates (other than a Transferred Entity) following the Closing and
shall not receive a Qualifying Offer prior to the Closing Date. A Delayed
Transfer Employee shall not be deemed a Continuing Employee (as defined below)
until and unless such employee presents himself or herself to Buyer for active
employment following the employee's return to active employment, which in all
events must be prior to the six month anniversary of the Closing Date.
Promptly following such Delayed Transfer Employee's return to active
employment prior to the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer (or
its Affiliates) shall make a Qualifying Offer to such Delayed Transfer
Employee and, if such Qualifying Offer is accepted, such Delayed Transfer
Employee shall be considered a Continuing Employee as of such date.

  

  

(c) As of the Closing Date, or if applicable, the date an Offered Employee
returns to active service and commences employment with the Buyer or the
Transferred Entities, subject to compliance with Applicable Law, Seller or its
Subsidiaries shall deliver to the Buyer copies of any personnel and employment
related records with respect to any Offered Employee or Delayed Transfer
Employee that Seller has in its possession.

  

  

(d) For purposes of clarity, nothing in Sections 9.01(a) and 9.01(b) shall
affect all employees of the Transferred Entities continuing to remain
employees of the Transferred Entities following the Closing Date with no
required action by Buyer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Section 9.02. Other Employee Matters. (a) For a period of one year following
the Closing Date (or, if shorter, during the period of employment), Buyer
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to (i) each employee of the
Transferred Entities who is employed on the Closing Date and (ii) each Offered
Employee who accepts a Qualifying Offer and becomes employed by Buyer or its
Affiliates on the Closing Date (each employee described in clauses (i) and
(ii), a "Continuing Employee"): (x) base salary, commissions and annual cash
bonus opportunities no less favorable than the base salary, commissions and
annual cash bonus opportunities provided to the Continuing Employee during the
12-months prior to the Closing Date and (y) employee benefits (excluding
equity or equity-based compensation, deferred compensation, retiree welfare
benefits or participation in a defined benefit pension plan) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. In addition, if within one
year following the Closing Date, any Continuing Employee incurs a qualifying
termination of employment in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
severance arrangement listed on Section 9.02(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (other than a Continuing Employee who is party to an agreement with a
Transferred Entity providing for severance benefits, whose rights shall be
governed by the terms of such agreements), Buyer shall provide, or shall cause
to be provided, severance payments and benefits to such Continuing Employee in
accordance with the terms and conditions of such severance arrangement (taking
into account such Continuing Employee's service as required pursuant to
Section 9.02(b) below).

  

  

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and calculation or
accrual of benefits in each employee benefit plan providing benefits (other
than benefits under a defined benefit pension plan) after the Closing Date
(the "New Plans"), each Continuing Employee shall receive full credit for his
or her service with the Transferred Entities or any of their Affiliates (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Seller or Company provides such past
service credit) to the same extent that such service was recognized prior to
the Closing Date, except as would result in the duplication of benefits or the
funding thereof.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) cause to be waived
all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees to
the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to
such Continuing Employees under the welfare plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid and for out-of-pocket
maximums incurred prior to the Closing Date for the plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan.

  

  

(d) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cover (or
cause to be covered) each Continuing Employee who is located in the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

  

United States (a "U.S. Employee") under one or more defined contribution plans
and trusts intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (the "Buyer DC
Plan"). As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall cause
the trustee of the applicable defined contribution plan and trust intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (the "Seller DC Plan") to transfer to
the trustee of the Buyer DC Plan, the amounts representing the account
balances of the U.S. Employees (including the appropriate net investment
return thereon and any participant loans made to any U.S. Employee), said
amounts to be established as account balances or accrued benefits of the U.S.
Employees under the Buyer DC Plan. The assets to be transferred pursuant to
this Section 9.02(d) shall be in cash or in kind (including participant loans)
and such transfer shall be conducted in accordance with Section 414(l) of the
Code, Treasury Regulation Section 1.414(l)-1, and Section 208 of ERISA. Seller
and Buyer shall cooperate with each other (and cause the trustees of the
Seller DC Plan and the Buyer DC Plan to cooperate with each other) to
effectuate the transfer of assets to the Buyer 401(k) Plan in an efficient and
effective manner and in the best interests of participants and beneficiaries,
including determining whether and to what extent any investments held under
the Seller DC Plan (other than participant loans) shall be liquidated prior to
the transfer date to enable the value of such investments to be transferred to
the Buyer DC Plan in cash or cash equivalents.

  

  

(e) Buyer shall honor (or cause to be honored) all paid time-off or vacation,
sick days, "floating holidays" and "tenure recognition days" accrued but
unused by each Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date.

  

  

(f) Prior to making any written communications to the Company Employees
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Seller shall provide Buyer with a
copy of the intended communication, Buyer shall have a reasonable period of
time to review and comment on the communication, and Seller agrees to take
into consideration Buyer's reasonable comments. Seller and its Subsidiaries
shall comply with all obligations under any Applicable Laws to notify and/or
consult with any employees or other service providers or any of their employee
representatives, unions, works councils or other representative bodies, if
any, after consultation with Buyer, and shall provide to Buyer such
information and access to such employees, service providers or representatives
as may be required for Buyer to comply with any notification and/or
consultation obligations, in each case in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(g) Buyer and Seller agree to fully cooperate in good faith to determine the
appropriate (i) treatment of the health care and dependent care flexible
account balances of each Continuing Employee following the Closing Date and
(ii) allocation of assets and liabilities with respect to the spinoff of the
Manila pension plan set forth in Section 3.21(a) of the Disclosure Schedule,
using generally acceptable and reasonable assumptions.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(h) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 9.02, or with
respect to any liabilities reflected as a current liability of a Transferred
Entity in Closing Working Capital on the Closing Statement (which shall be
liabilities of the Transferred Entities following the Closing), Seller or its
applicable Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities) shall retain
responsibility for (i) any liability to, in respect of, arising out of or in
connection with, any Employee Plan maintained or sponsored by the Seller and
its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities), (ii) any liability to,
in respect of, arising out of or in connection with, the employment or service
of any Offered Employee prior to the Closing Date, or if applicable, the date
an Offered Employee returns to active service and commences employment with
the Buyer or the Transferred Entities, and (iii) any and all liabilities under
any employment, severance, change in control, retention or other similar
agreements between a Company Employee on the one hand and Seller or one of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities) on the other ("Seller
Employment Liabilities"). Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, the
Transferred Entities and their Subsidiaries for and with respect to any such
Seller Employment Liabilities.

  

  

(i) Nothing in this Article 9, express or implied, shall (i) be treated as an
amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any benefit plan, program, arrangement
or policy (ii) prohibit Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, including the
Company, from amending any employee benefit plan, (iii) obligate Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates to retain the employment of or
to prevent the termination of employment of any particular employee (including
any Continuing Employee) or (iv) confer any rights or benefits on any person
other than the parties to this Agreement.

such right of indemnity shall have been given pursuant to Section 11.03 or
Section 11.04, as applicable, to the party against whom such indemnity may be

Section 11.02. Indemnification. (a) Effective at and after the Closing, Seller

Indemnified Tax Loss as described in Section 8.05(a) (or any amount which
would constitute a Seller Indemnified Tax Loss were it not for the application
of a Seller Indemnified Tax Loss Limitation as described in Section 8.05(a))
or any Taxes of a Buyer Indemnified Party for a Post-Closing Tax Period other
than Taxes resulting from a misrepresentation or breach of a Post-Closing Tax
Representation; provided further, that with respect to indemnification by
Seller for Warranty Breaches pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i), in each case
that does not relate to a Fundamental Warranty, (A) Seller shall not be liable
in respect of any such Warranty Breach or series of Warranty Breaches unless
the Damages with respect thereto exceed $75,000 (the "De Minimis Amount"), (B)
Seller shall not be liable in respect of any such Warranty Breach or series of
Warranty Breaches

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

79

(C) Seller's maximum liability for all such Warranty Breaches shall not exceed
$36,400,000 (the "Cap"); provided, further, that, with respect to
indemnification by Seller for Warranty Breaches pursuant to Section
11.02(a)(i) (including relating to a Fundamental Warranty), Seller's maximum
liability for all Warranty Breaches shall not exceed $364,000,000 (the
"Aggregate Cap").

  

  

(b) Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer and the Transferred Entities
(collectively, the "Buyer Indemnifying Parties") hereby jointly and severally
indemnify Seller and its Affiliates, and their respective direct or indirect
former, current or future directors, officers, equityholders, managers,
partners, members, attorneys, accountants, agents, representatives and
employees, and the respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns of the
foregoing, each in their capacities as such (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnified Parties") against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from
any and all Damages actually suffered by any Seller Indemnified Party arising
out of:

  

  

(i) any Warranty Breach; or

  

  

(ii) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement other than the covenants and agreements set forth
in Article 8;

  

  

provided that, Damages shall not include any amount that constitutes a Buyer
Indemnified Tax Loss as described in Section 8.05(b); and provided further,
that with respect to indemnification by the Buyer Indemnifying Parties for
Warranty Breaches pursuant to Section 11.02(b)(i), (A) the Buyer Indemnifying
Parties shall not be liable in respect of any such Warranty Breach or series
of Warranty Breaches, in each case that does not relate to a Fundamental
Warranty, unless the Damages with respect thereto exceed the De Minimis
Amount, (B) the Buyer Indemnifying Parties shall not be liable in respect of
any such Warranty Breach or series of Warranty Breaches, in each case that
does not relate to a Fundamental Warranty, until the aggregate amount of all
Damages above the De Minimis Amount exceed the Deductible, and then only to
the extent of such excess, and (C) the maximum liability of the Buyer
Indemnifying Parties for all such Warranty Breaches shall not exceed the Cap;
provided, further, that, with respect to indemnification by the Buyer
Indemnifying Parties for Warranty Breaches pursuant to Section 11.02(b)(i)
(including relating to a Fundamental Warranty), the maximum liability of the
Buyer Indemnifying Parties for all Warranty Breaches shall not exceed the
Aggregate Cap.

  

  

Section 11.03. Third Party Claim Procedures. (a) Each Person seeking
indemnification under this Article 11 (the "Indemnified Party") shall give
prompt notice to the Person from whom indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") or the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any
suit, action or proceeding by any third party ("Third Party Claim");

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

  

  

provided that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice as provided
in this Section 11.03(a) shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under Section 11.02, except to the extent that such failure
actually adversely prejudices the rights of any such Indemnifying Party. Such
notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for
indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party). Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all written notices and
documents (including any court papers) received by the Indemnified Party
relating to the Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall provide the
Indemnifying Party with such other information with respect to any such Third
Party Claim reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be represented
by counsel of its choice and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 11.03, to defend against, negotiate, settle (subject to Section
11.03(b)) or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim, but the Indemnifying
Party may nonetheless participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim
with its own counsel and at its own expense; provided that, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay
the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (x) the
claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment or investigation; (y) the claim seeks any form
of remedy other than monetary damages, and there is a reasonable possibility
(more than remote, but less than likely) that such non-monetary remedy may be
granted and, if granted, would reasonably be expected to be material; or (z)
the claim is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect after
giving effect to the Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligations under
this Article 11 in respect thereof. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be
deemed to be entitled to indemnification under this Article 11 in respect of
such Third Party Claim, unless material facts or circumstances not known to or
reasonably foreseeable by the Indemnifying Party at the time of its assumption
of the defense thereof subsequently emerge and result in the Indemnified Party
not being entitled to such indemnification in accordance with the terms
hereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified
Party may defend against, negotiate, settle (subject to Section 11.03(b)) or
otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party may
participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party
Claim subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control the defense thereof
(provided, that the Indemnified Party may jointly control such defense in the
event that the reasonably anticipated damages materially exceed the Cap);
provided that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any
such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if
(i) requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnifying Party, a material conflict
exists between the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

81  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation advisable; provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party shall
not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in connection with any Third Party Claim.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.03 to the contrary, neither
the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the other
party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default or
consent to entry of any judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, consent of
the Indemnified Party shall not be required for any such settlement if (i) the
sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party (provided that, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if the Indemnified Party withholds, conditions or delays its consent
to any settlement in which the sole relief provided is monetary damages that
are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party except to the extent of the
Deductible, and the applicable Third Party Claim is subsequently settled or
compromised, or a judgment is entered with respect thereto, for an amount that
is greater than the amount of the initially proposed settlement with respect
to which the Indemnified Party withheld, conditioned or delayed its consent,
then the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to the difference between the amount of such
final settlement, compromise or judgment and the amount of such initially
proposed settlement), (ii) such settlement does not permit any order,
injunction or other equitable relief to be entered, directly or indirectly,
against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates and (iii) such
settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party and its
officers, directors, employees and Affiliates from all liability on claims
that are the subject matter of such Third Party Claim and does not include any
statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or
on behalf of any Indemnified Party or its officers, directors, employees or
Affiliates. If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment on any Third Party
Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance
benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim.

  

  

(c) After any decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, or a settlement shall have
been consummated (in accordance with this Article 11), or the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have arrived at a mutually binding
agreement with respect to a Third Party Claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party
shall forward to the Indemnifying Party notice of any sums due and owing by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter
("Claim Notice"). Within five Business Days of receipt of the Claim Notice,
the Indemnifying Party shall pay such amount as set forth on the Claim Notice
to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the bank account or accounts designated by the Indemnified Party in the Claim
Notice.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

82  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony
relating to such Third Party Claim, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith without expense (other than reimbursements for actual
out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of a Third
Party Claim for Taxes of a Buyer Indemnified Party attributable to a
misrepresentation or breach of a Post-Closing Tax Representation, the
procedures set forth in Section 8.05 shall govern in lieu of the procedures
set forth in this Section 11.03.

  

  

Section 11.04. Direct Claim Procedures. In the event an Indemnified Party has
a claim for indemnity under Section 11.02 against an Indemnifying Party that
does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give
notice in writing, as promptly as practicable, of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such
claim and the basis for indemnification and the amount of such Damages
incurred or that such Indemnified Party reasonably estimates in good faith is
likely to be incurred in connection with such claim (taking into account the
information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to notify
the Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that
such failure shall have actually and materially prejudiced the Indemnifying
Party.

  

  

Section 11.05. Calculation of Damages. (a) The amount of any Damages payable
under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i) amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor, and (ii)
Tax Benefit actually received by the Indemnified Party arising from the
incurrence or payment of any such Damages. For purposes hereof, "Tax Benefit"
means, with respect to any Damages subject to any indemnity under Article 11,
an amount by which the net Tax liability of the Indemnified Party (or a group
filing a Tax Return that includes such Indemnified Party) is actually reduced
in, or prior to, the year the Damages were incurred solely as a result of
Damages or the amount of Tax refund that is generated solely as a result of
such Damages, and any related interest received from the applicable Taxing
Authority. If the Indemnified Party (A) receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any
Damages, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying
Party for any such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the
Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
collecting such amount and any increase in the applicable premium of any such
insurance policy or (B) receives any net Tax Benefit subsequent to an
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

  

  

then such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying Party the
amount of such net Tax Benefit up to the amount received by the Indemnified
Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting
such amount.

  

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02 for any (i)
Damages relating to any matter to the extent that where Seller is the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party had otherwise been compensated for
such matter pursuant to the calculation of Closing Working Capital, Closing
Cash or Closing Indebtedness or the Aggregate Purchase Price adjustment under
Section 2.05, (ii) consequential, punitive or exemplary Damages (in each case
except those payable to a third party), or (iii) Damages that would not exist
if not for, or to the extent aggravated by, any act or wrongful omission of
the Indemnified Party.

  

  

(c) Each Indemnified Party must take commercially reasonable steps (but
without any obligation to make any payment or incur any monetary or other
obligation) to mitigate in accordance with Applicable Law any loss for which
such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to collect any amounts
available under insurance coverage for any Damages payable under Section
11.02.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in all cases in
determining whether there has been a breach of a representation or warranty by
a party for purposes of this Article 11 and Section 8.05, or in determining
any amount of Damages with respect to such breach, such representation or
warranty shall be read without regard to any materiality qualifier (including
any reference to Material Adverse Effect) contained therein, except as set
forth in Section 3.08(a)(ii) and for any such qualifier to the extent it
qualifies an affirmative requirement to list specified items on a section of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, or to deliver, furnish, provide or otherwise
make available to Buyer copies of material items.

  

  

(f) If any Buyer Indemnified Party receives any payment from Seller in respect
of any Damages pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(iii) and the Buyer Indemnified
Party could have recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third party (a
"Potential Contributor") based on the underlying claim asserted against
Seller, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed
against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit Seller to recover
from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

  

  

Section 11.06. Exclusivity. Except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller and Shareholder, on the other
hand, each waive any rights and claims such party or parties may have against
the other, whether in law or in equity, relating to the Company, the other
Transferred

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

84  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Entities, or the Shares, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The rights and claims waived by Buyer, Seller and Shareholder include
claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating
to any Environmental Law (whether now or hereinafter in effect), claims for
breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent
misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty. After the Closing,
Sections 2.05, 8.05 and Article 11 and the expense and cost reimbursement and
indemnification provisions, as the case may be, of Sections 5.03, 7.05(d) and
7.06 will provide the exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty, covenant or other agreement or other claim arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than fraud or
intentional misrepresentation). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 11.06 shall limit any Person's right to seek and obtain any equitable
relief to which any Person shall be entitled to pursuant to Section 13.12 or
to seek any remedy on account of fraud or intentional misrepresentation by any
Person.

  

  

  

ARTICLE 12

  

Termination

  

  

Section 12.01. Grounds for Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

  

  

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

  

  

(b) by either Seller or Buyer, if the Closing shall not have been consummated
on or before July 15, 2014 (the "End Date"), provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.01(b) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has
caused or resulted in the failure of the Closing to be consummated by such
time;

  

  

(c) by either Seller or Buyer, if there shall be any Applicable Law that (A)
makes consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or
otherwise prohibited or (B) permanently enjoins Buyer, Seller or Shareholder
from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby and such injunction
shall have become final and nonappealable, provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.01(c) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has
caused or resulted in such Applicable Law being enacted or becoming applicable
to the transactions contemplated hereby (including due to a failure to use
reasonable best efforts in connection with the actions specified in Section
7.01 to the extent required thereunder);

  

  

(d) by Buyer if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 10.02(a) or 10.02(b) not to be satisfied, and such conditions are
incapable

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

85  

  

 

 

 

  

  

of being satisfied by the End Date or, if curable, is not cured within 30 days
of receipt by Seller of written notice of such breach or failure, provided
that Buyer is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the
conditions set forth in Section 10.01 or 10.03 not to be satisfied;

  

  

(e) by Seller if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 10.03(a) or 10.03(b) not to be satisfied, and such conditions are
incapable of being satisfied by the End Date or, if curable, is not cured
within 30 days of receipt by Buyer of written notice of such breach or
failure, provided that Seller is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to
cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 10.01 or 10.02 not to be
satisfied;

  

  

(f) by Seller if (i) all of the conditions in Sections 10.01 and 10.02 have
been satisfied or irrevocably waived by the party entitled to waive such
condition (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied at the
Closing) or the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to
a breach by Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) of this Agreement, (ii) Seller
has given written notice to Buyer that it is ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing, (iii) Buyer shall not have received the proceeds of
the Debt Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and the failure to receive such proceeds is not
attributable to a Willful Breach by Buyer, and (iv) Buyer fails to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within three Business Days
following the date on which the Closing should have occurred pursuant to
Section 2.02 hereof; or

  

  

(g) by Seller if (i) all of the conditions in Sections 10.01 and 10.02 have
been satisfied or irrevocably waived by the party entitled to waive such
condition (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied at the
Closing) or the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to
a breach by Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) of this Agreement, (ii) Seller
has given written notice to Buyer that it is ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing, (iii) (x) Buyer shall not have received the proceeds
of the Debt Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and the failure to receive such proceeds is attributable
to a Willful Breach by Buyer, (y) the Debt Financing has been funded or (z)
all conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing have been satisfied (other
than the funding of the Equity Financing) and the Debt Financing will be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at such time, and (iv)
Buyer fails to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
within three Business Days following the date on which the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof.

  

  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.01
(other than in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 12.01(a)) shall
give

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

86  

  

 

 

 

  

  

notice of such termination to the other party. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Willful Breach" means a willful and material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 12.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as
permitted by Section 12.01, subject to the provisions of Section 12.03, such
termination shall be without liability of any party (or any stockholder or
other Representative of such party) to any other party hereto and the
provisions of this Agreement shall immediately be of no further force or
effect; provided that the Guarantee (to the extent set forth therein), the
Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of this Section 12.02, the expense
and cost reimbursement and indemnification provisions of Section 7.05(d) and
the provisions of Sections 6.01, 7.03, 12.03 and Article 13 shall survive any
such termination; provided, further, that the termination of this Agreement
shall not relieve any party hereto from any liability for (i) fraud or
intentional misrepresentation and (ii) subject to Sections 12.03(a) and
12.03(b), any Willful Breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 12.03. Termination Fee and Related Matters. (a) If this Agreement is
terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 12.01(e), Section 12.01(f) or Section
12.01(g), Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company the Buyer
Termination Fee within two Business Days after such termination by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by the
Company, it being understood that in no event shall Buyer be required to pay
the Buyer Termination Fee on more than one occasion. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Buyer Termination Fee" means (i) $36,400,000, in circumstances
where a Buyer Termination Fee is payable pursuant to (x) Section 12.01(g) or
(y) Section 12.01(e), and (ii) $25,480,000 in circumstances where a Buyer
Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 12.01(f).

  

  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated and the Buyer Termination
Fee is payable under Section 12.03(a), Seller's receipt of the Buyer
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 12.03(a) (including any interest thereon)
shall be (i) deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by Seller, its Affiliates and each of their respective
former, current and future Representatives, stockholders, Affiliates and
assignees and each former, current or future Representatives, stockholder,
Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for the
termination giving rise to the payment of such Buyer Termination Fee, and (ii)
the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise) of Seller against Buyer, Guarantor, the Debt Financing sources
under the Debt Commitment Letters and their respective former, current and
future Affiliates, officers, directors, managers, employees, equityholders,
managers, members, partners, agents, representatives or assigns (collectively,
but excluding Buyer, the "Buyer Related Parties") for

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

87  

  

 

 

 

  

  

any loss or Damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Closing to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, and neither Buyer
nor any Buyer Related Party shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that in the event that this Agreement is terminated
and the Buyer Termination Fee is payable under Section 12.03(a), this Section
12.03(b) shall not limit the ability of the Company to recover reimbursement
for costs and expenses and indemnification under Section 7.05(d). For the
avoidance of doubt, the amount of the Buyer Termination Fee is intended to
serve as a cap on the maximum aggregate liability of Buyer and the Buyer
Related Parties under this Agreement in the event Buyer fails to effect the
Closing in accordance with Section 2.02 of this Agreement or otherwise
breaches this Agreement or fails to perform hereunder; provided, further, that
the Buyer Termination Fee shall not serve as a cap on any costs and expenses
and indemnification owed under Section 7.05(d), nor shall any such
reimbursement or indemnification amounts reduce the amount of the Buyer
Termination Fee. Nothing in this Section 12.03(b) shall restrict (x) the
availability to Seller of any remedies in connection with fraud, for which all
applicable legal and equitable remedies shall be available to Seller and (y)
Seller's entitlement to seek and obtain specific performance as and to the
extent permitted by Section 13.12.

  

  

(c) Buyer acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 12.03 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, Seller would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if Buyer fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this
Section 12.03, it shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by Seller in
connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a
judgment against Buyer or Guarantor for such amount, together with interest on
the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the prime rate as published
in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition from the date such fee, cost or
expense was required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date.

accountants, auditors and experts incurred (and unpaid) by the Company and the
other Transferred Entities in connection with this Agreement shall be deemed
to be costs and expenses of Seller.

Section 6.05, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Debt Financing source and its successors
and assigns shall be an express third party beneficiary with respect to
Sections 12.03(b), 13.02, 13.06(b), 13.07, 13.12(b)(ii) and this Section 13.04
(the "DFS Provisions").

  

  

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto.

  

  

Section 13.05. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to
agreements made and to be performed therein.

  

  

Section 13.06. Jurisdiction. (a) The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State
court sitting in New York City, so long as one of such courts shall have
subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any
cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen
from a transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

90  

  

 

 

 

  

  

any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such
court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing and without limiting Section 13.06(a), each
party hereto agrees that that it will not bring or support any action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Debt Financing sources in any way relating to this Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, including any dispute arising out of the Debt Commitment Letters or
the performance thereof, in any forum other than any Federal or State court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process
on such party as provided in Section 13.01 shall be deemed effective service
of process on such party.

  

  

Section 13.07. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (INCLUDING THE DEBT FINANCING).

  

  

Section 13.08. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by each other
party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). No provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations,
or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

  

  

Section 13.09. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

91  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Section 13.10. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  

  

Section 13.11. Disclosure Schedules. The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section of either the Seller Disclosure Schedule or
the Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or,
as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any other
representations and warranties of such party that is contained in this
Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or
a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties is
reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed therein to the
Person to which such disclosure is being made. The inclusion of any
information in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable, shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the
terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or would result in
a Material Adverse Effect or is outside the ordinary course of business.

  

  

Section 13.12. Specific Performance. (a) The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby) were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof and that, subject to Section 13.12(b), the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter and, in the case
of Seller, the Guarantee, or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof or thereof in any federal court located in the
State of New York or, to the extent that no such federal court has
jurisdiction over such proceeding, in any New York state court, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
acknowledged and agreed that:

  

  

(i) Seller shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Buyer to draw
down the full proceeds of the Equity Financing pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Equity Commitment Letters and to cause

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

92  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Buyer to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 2.02 hereof, in each
case only if (A) all of the conditions to closing set forth in Sections 10.01
and 10.02 have been satisfied or irrevocably waived (other than those
conditions that, by their nature, can only be satisfied at the Closing, each
of which shall be capable of being satisfied at the Closing, and other than
those conditions the failure of which to be satisfied is caused by or results
from a breach by Buyer of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement), (B) the Debt Financing has been or is
reasonably expected to be funded on the Closing Date if the Equity Financing
is funded on the Closing Date, (C) Buyer fails to complete the Closing on the
date when the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof and
(D) Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if specific performance
is granted, then the Closing will occur; and

  

  

(ii) If (A) the Financing Date has occurred, (B) Seller and the Company have
complied in all material respects with their obligations under Section 7.05
and (C) the conditions to the Debt Financing have been satisfied, Seller shall
be entitled to specific performance to cause Buyer to enforce the terms of the
Debt Commitment Letters, including by requiring Buyer to file one or more
lawsuits against the Debt Financing sources thereunder in order to fully
enforce such Debt Financing sources' obligations thereunder and the rights of
Buyer thereunder; and

  

  

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, upon payment of the Buyer Termination Fee,
none of the financing sources in respect of the Debt Financing will have any
liability or obligation to Seller, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, any of their former, current and future direct or indirect
equityholders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, members, managers, general or limited partners, lenders or
assignees or any of their Affiliates relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or performance hereunder or
thereunder or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or
in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity or otherwise.

  

  

(c) Each party further agrees that, subject to the preceding clause (b), they
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that any other party has an
adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or the Equity
Commitment Letter and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

93  

  

 

 

 

  

  

the Equity Commitment Letter shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

  

  

(d) It is acknowledged and agreed that Seller may pursue both a grant of
specific performance under this Section 13.12 and the payment of the Buyer
Termination Fee and other amounts payable pursuant to Section 13.12, provided
that in no event shall Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both (i) a
grant of specific performance that permits the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof and (ii) the Buyer Termination Fee and any other amounts payable
pursuant to Section 13.12. Subject to the preceding sentence, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  

  

Section 13.13. No Recourse. Without limiting any other provision of this
Agreement, it is hereby agreed and acknowledged that this Agreement may only
be enforced against, and any claims of action that may be based upon, arise
out of, or relate to, this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, may only be made against the parties hereto,
and no Buyer Related Party or any former, current and future Affiliates,
officers, directors, managers, employees, equityholders, managers, members,
partners, agents, representatives or assigns of Seller or Shareholder, in each
case who is not a party to this Agreement shall have any liability for any
obligations of the parties hereto or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby.
