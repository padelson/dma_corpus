provisions establishing the basis for such calculation of the Net Working
Capital, in each case together with supporting documentation used by the
Sellers in calculating such amounts. The NWC Statement (including the
calculations therein) shall be prepared in accordance with the Agreed
Accounting Principles and the Example Net Working Capital Statement;
provided, that Net Working Capital shall also be calculated in accordance with
the definition of that term herein (and any other defined terms incorporated
therein). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Reasonable Access. From and after the Closing, the Sellers
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, on reasonable prior notice to the
Sellers and subject to the execution of customary work paper access letters if
requested by accountants of the Sellers, (i) provide the Buyer and its
Representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
facilities, Records and work papers of the Business and (ii) cooperate with
and assist the Buyer and its Representatives in connection with the review of
such materials, including by making available their employees, accountants and
other personnel to the extent reasonably requested, in each case in connection
with the Buyer's review of the NWC Statement; provided, that, in the event
that Sellers do not provide such access or cooperation reasonably requested by
the Buyer or any of its Representatives within two (2) Business Days of any
request therefor (or, such shorter period as may remain in the Review Period),
the Review Period will be extended by one (1) Business Day for each additional
day required for Sellers to fully respond to such request. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Notice of Objection. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) If the Buyer has any objections to the NWC Statement, it
shall deliver to the Sellers a written statement (a "Notice of Objection")
setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement
(including the specific items in the NWC Statement that are in dispute and the
nature and amount of any disagreement so identified) not later than thirty
(30) days after the Buyer's receipt of the NWC Statement (such thirty (30)-day
period, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.5(b) above the "Review
Period"). If the Buyer fails to deliver a Notice of Objection within the
Review Period (or applicable later date if such period is tolled), the NWC
Statement and the amount set forth therein shall be deemed to have been
accepted by the Buyer and shall be deemed final and binding upon all of the
Parties. If the Buyer delivers a Notice of Objection to the Sellers within
the Review Period, the Sellers and Buyer shall work in good faith to resolve
the Buyer's objections within the thirty (30)-day period following the
delivery of the Notice of Objection. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) If the Buyer has no objections to the NWC Statement, the
Buyer may deliver to the Sellers a written statement stating that it has no
objections to the NWC \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tStatement during the Review Period (such notice, a "Notice of No
Objections"). In the case that the Buyer delivers a Notice of No Objection,
there shall be no Review Period and the NWC Statement delivered by the Sellers
shall be deemed the Final NWC Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Resolution of Dispute. In the event that the Sellers and
the Buyer are unable to resolve in writing any of the Buyer's objections in
the Notice of Objection within the thirty (30)-day period (or such longer
period as may be agreed by the Buyer and the Sellers) following the delivery
of a Notice of Objection, the resolution of all unresolved items ("Disputed
Items") shall be submitted to Ernst and Young LLP (or such other independent
accounting firm of recognized national standing in the United States as may be
mutually selected by the Buyer and the Sellers) (such accounting firm, the
"Accounting Firm") to resolve any remaining disagreements, provided, however,
that if Ernst and Young LLP would not have a substantial conflict at the time of
its appointment due to one or more accounting relationships with the Buyer or
the Sellers, the Buyer and the Sellers shall mutually select an alternative
independent accounting firm of recognized national standing in the United
States. The Buyer shall execute any agreement reasonably required by the
Accounting Firm for its engagement hereunder. The Sellers shall, promptly
(but in any event within ten (10) Business Days) following the formal
engagement of the Accounting Firm, provide the Accounting Firm (copying the
other upon submission) with a written presentation setting forth its
calculations of and assertions regarding the Disputed Items and shall allow
the Accounting Firm to conduct an independent analysis and audit of the
Disputed Items using the Agreed Accounting Principles and the Example Net
Working Capital Statement and taking into account the definition of that term
herein (and any other defined terms incorporated therein). The Accounting
Firm shall be instructed to render its determination with respect to such
Disputed Items as soon as reasonably practicable (which the Parties agree
shall not be later than forty-five (45) days following the formal engagement
of the Accounting Firm). The Parties agree that the purpose of the adjustment
contemplated by this Section 2.5 is to measure the amount of Net Working
Capital as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date using the Agreed
Accounting Principles and the Example Net Working Capital Statement and taking
into account the definition of that term herein (and any other defined terms
incorporated therein). The determination of the Accounting Firm, acting as an
expert and not an arbitrator, with respect to any such disagreements shall be
binding and final for purposes of this Agreement. The term "Final NWC
Statement" as used in this Agreement shall mean the NWC Statement that is
deemed final in accordance with Section 2.5(c) or the NWC Statement resulting
from the determinations made by the Accounting Firm in accordance with this
Section 2.5(d), as applicable. The term "Final Purchase Price" as used in
this Agreement shall mean the Purchase Price plus the Net Working Capital
(which may be a negative number) set forth in the Final NWC Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Accounting Firm Fees. The Accounting Firm shall allocate
its costs and expenses between Buyer and the Sellers based on the percentage
of the aggregate contested amount submitted to the Accounting Firm that is
ultimately awarded to the Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers, on the other
hand, such that the Buyer bears a percentage of such costs and expenses equal
to the percentage of the contested amount awarded to the Sellers and the
Sellers bear a percentage of such costs and expenses equal to the percentage
of the contested amount awarded to the Buyer. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Adjustment Payments. Within two (2) Business Days
following the determination of the Final NWC Statement, (x) the Buyer or the
Sellers shall make an \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tadditional payment in immediately available funds in respect of the
Purchase Price (if applicable) as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) if the Net Working Capital reflected on the Final NWC
Statement is a positive number, the Buyer shall pay the Sellers the amount of
such Net Working Capital. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) if the Net Working Capital reflected on the Final NWC
Statement is a negative number, the Sellers shall pay the Buyer the absolute
value of such Net Working Capital; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) if the Net Working Capital reflected on the Final NWC
Statement is zero, then neither the Buyer nor Seller shall have any payment
obligation pursuant to this Section 2.5(f). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAny payment pursuant to this Section 2.5(f) shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all tax purposes. No Losses may be
claimed under Article 13 or otherwise by any Indemnified Party to the extent
such Liabilities are reflected in the Net Working Capital set forth in the
Final NWC Statement pursuant to this Section 2.5. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.6 Allocation of the Purchase Price. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Within ninety (90) days after the final determination of
the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.5, the Sellers will provide the
Buyer with a statement (or statements) (the "Asset Acquisition Statement")
with the Sellers' proposed allocation of the Final Purchase Price (plus any
other amounts, including Assumed Liabilities, to the extent properly taken
into account as consideration for applicable Tax purposes) among the
Transferred Assets and, if applicable, the Ancillary Agreements and any other
rights transferred hereunder or thereunder in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code (and any other applicable state, local or non-U.S. Law). The Buyer
may, within thirty (30) days after receiving such Asset Acquisition Statement,
propose to the Sellers in writing any changes to such Asset Acquisition
Statement that are consistent with applicable Law (the "Allocation Notice of
Objection"), and if the Buyer does not deliver such a Notice of Objection
within such period, the Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted such proposed
Asset Acquisition Statement and it shall become final and binding on the
Parties. If the Buyer delivers a Notice of Objection, then the Buyer and the
Sellers will endeavor in good faith to resolve any differences with respect to
the Asset Acquisition Statement within thirty (30) days after the Sellers'
receipt of the Notice of Objection. If the Buyer and the Sellers are unable to
resolve such differences, the matters in dispute shall be resolved by the
Accounting Firm, which determination by such Accounting Firm shall be
consistent with this Agreement. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Buyer and the Sellers in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm,
which proportionate allocations also shall be determined by the Accounting
Firm at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Buyer and the Sellers agree that they shall each (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to) file all Tax Returns (including
amended returns and claims for refunds) and information reports in a manner
consistent with the Asset Acquisition Statement (as finalized pursuant to
Section 2.6(a))); provided that nothing contained in this Section 2.6(b) shall
prevent any Party (or their Affiliates) from settling, or require any of them
to litigate any challenge, proposed deficiency, adjustment or other similar
proceeding by any Governmental \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAuthority with respect to the Asset Acquisition Statement. Upon any
adjustment to the Purchase Price in connection with an indemnification claim
made pursuant to Article 13, the allocation described in the Asset Acquisition
Statement (as finalized pursuant to Section 2.6(a)) shall be subject to
adjustment in a manner consistent with Section 2.6(a). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tExcept as set forth in the Disclosure Schedules delivered by the
Sellers to the Buyer immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the
"Disclosure Schedules") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
Section or subsection of a Disclosure Schedule shall apply only to the
corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement and to any other Section
or subsection of this Agreement to the extent that the relevance of such item
is reasonably apparent on its face in the Disclosure Schedules), TMUS, with
respect to itself (solely with respect to Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.17) and
Sprint, with respect to itself, the Business, the Transferred Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities, hereby represents and warrants to the Buyer as
follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.1 Organization. Each Seller is duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Each Seller
or any applicable Affiliate of such Seller which has title to any asset
reasonably expected to be a Transferred Asset is duly qualified and in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which Transferred Assets held by it are
currently used by such Seller or such Affiliate and where the ownership,
leasing, operation or use of its assets requires such qualification. Each
Seller or the applicable Affiliate of such Seller has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease, operate or use, as the case may be, the
Transferred Assets. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.2 Authorization, Enforceability. Each Seller has all requisite
corporate power and authority to enter into, execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
to which it is a party and to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder. The execution and delivery by such Seller of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, the performance by such
Seller of its obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
and the consummation by such Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on such Seller's part, including any consent or approval from DT or
SoftBank necessary to authorize such execution, delivery or performance. This
Agreement has been, and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party will
be, duly and validly executed and delivered by such Seller and constitutes or
will constitute, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
other parties thereto, a valid and binding obligation of such Seller,
enforceable against such Seller in accordance with their respective terms,
except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (whether
considered in a Proceeding in equity or at law) (the "Remedy
Exceptions"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.3 No Approvals or Conflicts. Assuming the Regulatory Approvals
are sought and obtained in accordance with this Agreement, neither the
execution and delivery by each Seller of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party, nor the consummation by such Seller or any
of its Affiliates of the Transaction, will (a) conflict with or violate any
provision of such Seller's Governing Documents, (b) subject to Section 14.12,
conflict with \t\t

Assets under any provision of the NTM Merger Agreement, (c) require on the

than, in the case of clauses (c), (d) and (e), any such conflict, breach,
default, termination, cancellation, imposition or violation that, or notice,
consent, waiver, or Permit, the failure of which to make or be obtained, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to the Business. \t\t

 \t\t\t3.4 Litigation. \t\t

receivable (i) are subject to any pending or threatened set-off, discount or
counterclaim, other than for which a reserve has been established on the
financial statements of the Company or as set forth in Schedule 3.6(c), or
(ii) have been assigned or pledged to any Person. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Since March 31, 2019, the Inventory has been maintained in
the Ordinary Course of Business. All such Inventories are owned free and

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.7 No Undisclosed Liabilities. There are no Liabilities
arising or resulting from the operation of the Business or the ownership of
the Transferred Assets (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
other than Liabilities that (i) are future executory Liabilities arising under
any Transferred Contract (other than as a result of breach of contract, tort,
infringement or violation of applicable Law), (ii) are set forth on Schedule
3.7, (iii) have not had, or would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) constitute

through the date hereof, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted the
Business in the Ordinary Course of Business (b) there has not been, with
respect to the Business or any Transferred Asset, any event which,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect and (c) through the date hereof, any action

during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date,
would constitute a violation or breach of or would otherwise require consent
under Section 5.1(b) (other than clauses (ii), (v) and (vi) thereto)). \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Such Seller has timely paid (or caused to be paid) all

Business and the Transferred Assets. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) All material Taxes required to be withheld and remitted by
such Seller under any applicable law with respect to the Business or the
Transferred Assets have been duly and timely withheld and remitted to the
proper Taxing Authority. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) There are no material Encumbrances on the Transferred
Assets for any failure (or alleged failure) to pay Taxes (other than Permitted
Encumbrances). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Such Seller is not engaged in any audit, examination or
investigation by any Taxing Authority for which such Seller expects a material

effect of waiving or extending, the statute of limitations or the period of
assessment or collection of any material Taxes, in each case, is currently in
effect with respect to the Business or the Transferred Assets. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the
representations and warranties made in this Section 3.9 (i) do not refer to
any matters other than Tax matters that would give rise to an Encumbrance
(other than a Permitted Encumbrance) on the Transferred Assets or a Tax for
which the Buyer (or its Affiliates) would be liable and (ii) may not be relied
upon with respect to any taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning after
the Closing Date or with respect to Tax positions taken by the Buyer or the
Buyer's Affiliates. \t\t

meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (i) has received a favorable
determination letter or has received a favorable opinion letter from the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") as to its qualification, or (ii) has time

reasonably could be expected to result in an increase, temporary or otherwise,
in the demand for the Inventory offered by the Business prior to the Closing,
including sales of Inventory (i) with payment terms longer than terms offered

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Nothing in this Section 5.1 is intended to give the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the business or operations of either Business prior to the Closing, and
prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over their
respective Businesses. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) For the purpose of any consent which may be requested from
the Buyer pursuant to Section 5.1(a) or Section 5.1(b), it is specifically
agreed that failure by the Buyer to respond in writing (including by e-mail)
to a written consent request made by or on behalf of a Seller within five (5)
Business Days of the submission of such request pursuant to Section 14.11
shall be deemed for all intents and purposes under this Agreement as a grant
of the requested consent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.2 Regulatory Approvals. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) In connection with the Transaction, each of the Buyer and
the Sellers shall cooperate with the other Parties and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the DOJ \t\t

practicable. The Buyer shall not take any action to impair or materially delay
the other Regulatory Approvals. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject
to the terms and conditions herein, the Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the Transaction and
to cause the conditions set forth in Section 9.1(a) to be satisfied as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, including (i) using
reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain all necessary consents, approvals,

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) In furtherance of and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Parties shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable
best efforts to file with the FCC, at an appropriate time following the date
of the DOJ Final Judgment as mutually agreed by the parties (but, in any
event, not earlier than ten (10) Business Days after the date of the DOJ Final
Judgment or later than 65 calendar days after the date of the DOJ Final
Judgment), (i) an application for approval under Section 214 of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended to assign the Business's
U.S.-international telecommunications customer accounts to the Buyer (the "FCC
214 Application") and (ii) the MNSA for approval by the FCC. The Parties shall
cooperate and use their respective reasonable efforts to obtain the FCC 214
Approval and FCC MNSA Approval and shall each bear their own costs for such
preparation, filing and prosecution. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) In furtherance of and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, (i) use their respective reasonable best efforts to (x) obtain the DOJ
Consent and the approval of the Transaction by the DOJ as required by the DOJ
or the DOJ Final Judgment, including promptly submitting to the DOJ all
documents and information that the DOJ reasonably requests from a Party,
whether written or oral, and if the DOJ notifies, orally or in writing, the
Sellers, the Buyer or their respective Affiliates that this Agreement or the
Transaction is not acceptable unless certain language of this Agreement is
modified, the Buyer and the Sellers shall consider in good faith such
modifications and shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay their
agreement to such modifications, and (y) take promptly any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all
consents under any Antitrust Law that may be required by any Governmental
Authority, in each case with competent jurisdiction or by any DOJ Final
Judgment, so as to enable the Parties to close the Transaction as promptly as
practicable, (ii) use their respective reasonable best efforts to (x) obtain
the FCC MNSA Approval and FCC 214 Approval, and any state public utility
commission approval of the Transaction required by Law, including promptly
submitting to the FCC or relevant state public utility commission all
documents and information that such authority reasonably requests from a
Party, whether written or oral, regarding the Transaction and if the FCC or
relevant state public utility commission notifies, orally or in writing, the
Sellers, the Buyer or their respective Affiliates that this Agreement or the
Transaction is not acceptable unless certain language of this Agreement is
modified, each of the Parties shall consider in good faith such modifications
and, subject to Section 11.1(c)(iii), shall not unreasonably withhold,
condition or delay their agreement to such modifications, and (y) take
promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment and obtain all consents regarding the Transaction that may be
required by any Governmental Authority, in each case with competent
jurisdiction, so \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tas to enable the Parties to close the Transaction as promptly as
practicable, (iii) vigorously contest (x) any civil, criminal or
administrative Proceedings brought by any Governmental Authority or any other
Person against such Party or its Affiliates seeking to enjoin, restrain,
prevent, prohibit or make illegal the consummation of the Transaction or
seeking damages or to impose any terms or conditions on the Transaction, and
(y) any Governmental Order that enjoins, restrains, prevents, prohibits or
makes illegal the consummation of any of the Transaction or imposes any
damages, terms or conditions on the Transaction, and (iv) use their respective
reasonable best efforts to (x) resolve any objections the DOJ, FCC or any
other Governmental Authority may assert under any applicable Law with respect
to the Transaction, and obtain the Governmental Authority approvals of the
Transaction required by Law, and (y) resolve any objections that any Third
Party may assert relating to the obtaining of any consent, approval, waiver or
authorization required from such Third Party in connection with the
Transaction; provided that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Parties shall not be obligated to (and without the other
Parties' consent, a Party shall not with respect to the Business) agree to or
accept any divestiture or other structural or conduct relief or new
contractual commitments, including network or spectrum sharing arrangements,
that were not previously agreed to by the Party as of the date hereof, in
order to obtain the Regulatory Approvals or any approval of any other
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transaction. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.2 or
Section 14.2 shall be deemed to amend, modify or expand the obligations of
TMUS or the Company under the NTM Merger Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Each Party shall promptly furnish to the other Parties
copies of any notices, requests or written communications, and shall promptly
describe to the Sellers any oral communications, received by such Party or any
of its Affiliates or Parent Affiliates from any third party or any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transaction, and each Party shall
permit counsel to the other Party an opportunity to review in advance, and the
Buyer shall consider in good faith and reflect the views of such counsel in
connection with, any proposed communications by the Buyer or its Affiliates to
any Governmental Authority concerning the Transaction; provided, however that
(i) materials may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation,
projections, business plans or prospects of the Transferred Assets or Business
or as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege
concerns and (ii) this sentence shall not require any sharing of documents or
information not permitted by the applicable Governmental Authority. The Buyer
shall provide the Sellers the opportunity, on reasonable advance notice, to
participate in any substantive meetings or discussions, either in person or by
telephone, between the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other
hand, concerning or in connection with the Transaction, where permitted by
such Governmental Authority. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall regularly
review with each other the progress of obtaining the Governmental Authority
approvals of the Transaction and any notifications or filings (including,
where necessary, seeking to identify appropriate commitments or submissions to
address any concerns identified by any Governmental Authority) pertaining to
such approvals and discuss with each other the scope, timing and tactics of
any such commitments or submissions with a view to obtain approval of the
Transaction by all relevant Governmental Authorities, at the earliest time
possible. Buyer shall not take any action, or permit their respective
Affiliates to take any action, that would reasonably be expected to materially
delay or prevent the consummation of the Transaction, including with respect
to the Financing. Sellers shall not take any action, or permit their \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t36  \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\trespective Affiliates to take any action, that would reasonably be
expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Transaction,
except as may be permitted or required under the NTM Merger Agreement,
provided, that any such actions taken under the NTM Merger Agreement would not
materially and adversely affect the Transferred Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.3 Third Party Consents. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign, directly or
indirectly, any asset (including any Contract), claim or right, or any benefit
arising under or resulting from such asset, claim or right, if an attempted
direct or indirect assignment thereof, without the consent or waiver of a
Third Party (each, a "Consent"), would constitute a breach or other
contravention of the rights of such Third Party, would be ineffective with
respect to any party to a Contract concerning such asset, claim or right or
would in any way adversely affect the rights of the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates or, upon transfer, the Buyer under such asset, claim or
right. If any direct or indirect transfer or assignment by the Sellers or
their respective Affiliates to, or any direct or indirect assumption by the
Buyer of, any interest in, or liability, obligation or commitment under, any
asset, claim or right requires a Consent, then such transfer, assignment or
assumption shall be made subject to such Consent being obtained, provided that
to the extent such Consent is not able to be obtained in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 5.3, the provisions of Section 12.3 shall apply to
such asset, claim or right. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Following the date hereof until the Closing Date, the
Parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable
best efforts, subject to and without limiting anything contained in this
Agreement, to obtain all material Consents, including, in the case of the
Company, using reasonable best efforts to transfer to Buyer all Transferred
Contracts, including agency, dealer, reseller and other distribution
agreements and all supplier and customer agreements that are Transferred
Assets. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Neither the Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall have any obligation to (i) pay any consideration to any Person for the
purpose of obtaining any Consent, or (ii) pay any costs or expenses of any
Person in connection with obtaining any Consent, unless all of such costs and
expenses (if any) will be borne exclusively by the Buyer. Nothing in this
provision shall affect any obligation in any Ancillary Agreement to the extent
expressly provided therein. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) The Buyer further expressly acknowledges that none of the
Consents is a condition to the consummation of the Transaction and the Buyer
acknowledges that no condition shall be deemed not satisfied as a result of
(i) the failure to obtain any Consents, (ii) any termination of any Contract
(including any Transferred Contract) as a result of the Transaction or (iii)
any Proceedings commenced or threatened by any Person arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any Consent or avoid any such termination,
in each case, except to the extent resulting directly from a breach by the
Sellers of (x) their express obligations under this Section 5.3 or (y) of any
representation regarding nonâ€‘contravention, including their representation set
forth in Section 3.3. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer shall provide
each Seller (or their applicable Affiliates) such information and references
(including regarding its creditworthiness) as may reasonably and timely be
requested by any relevant Third Party for the purposes of obtaining the
required Consents and shall enter into such undertakings or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t37  \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tprocure such guarantees in favor of any relevant Third Party as may be
reasonably requested by such relevant Third Party for the purposes of
obtaining the required Consents. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) The provisions of this Section 5.3 shall not apply with
respect to the Shared Contracts, with respect to which Section 5.4 shall
apply. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.4 Shared Contracts. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Except as otherwise agreed by the Sellers and the Buyer or
as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements
(including with respect to any Contract identified by Buyer and Seller as
reasonably necessary for Buyer to continue operation of the Business upon
termination of any service provided under the Transition Services Agreement),
until the expiration or termination date of the applicable Shared Contract
(assuming, for these purposes, that the thenâ€‘current term in effect as of
immediately prior to the Closing is not renewed or extended), the Parties
shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) use reasonable best efforts to
obtain or structure an arrangement for the Buyer to receive the rights and
benefits, and bear the obligations and burdens, of the portion of such Shared
Contract that the Buyer determines is reasonably necessary for Buyer to
continue operation of the Business upon termination of any service provided
under the Transition Services Agreement; provided, that the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates shall not be required to take any action that would, in
the goodâ€‘faith judgment of the Sellers, constitute a breach or other
contravention of the rights of any Person(s), be ineffective under, or
contravene, applicable Law or any such Shared Contract or adversely affect the
contractual rights of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates. The
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates for and against all out-of-pocket Liabilities (including Tax
Liabilities) arising out of or relating to each such arrangement. With respect
to any Liability pursuant to, under or relating to any Shared Contract, such
Liability shall be allocated between the applicable Seller, on the one hand,
and the Buyer, on the other hand, as follows: (i) if a Liability is incurred
solely in respect of the Business or the other businesses of such Seller, such
Liability shall be allocated to the Buyer (to the extent it would otherwise
constitute an Assumed Liability) or such Seller (to the extent it would
otherwise constitute an Excluded Liability), and (ii) if a Liability cannot be
so allocated under clause (i), such Liability shall be allocated to such
applicable Seller, or the Buyer, as the case may be, based on the relative
proportion of total benefit received by the Business (taking into account the
extent to which such Liability would otherwise constitute an Assumed Liability
or an Excluded Liability hereunder) and the other businesses of such Seller
under the relevant Shared Contract, as reasonably determined by such Seller
consistent with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
Sellers and the Buyer shall be responsible for any or all Liabilities arising
from its (or its Affiliates') direct or indirect breach of any Shared
Contract. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall be construed so as to
require any of the Parties or their respective Affiliates to pay money to any
Third Party, commence any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any Third Party in connection with the separation
or transfer of, or otherwise in respect of, any Shared Contract. For the
avoidance of doubt, neither the Sellers nor the Buyer shall be required to
provide credit support for the other Party in respect of such other Party's
portion of a Shared Contract. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.5 Insurance. Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, assign, to the extent assignable, to Buyer any and all proceeds
under any of either Seller's or any of its controlled Affiliates' Third Party
insurance policies written prior to the Closing to the extent received in
connection with (i) the damage or destruction of any of the Transferred Assets
from \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t38  \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tand after the date hereof and prior to the Closing that is, or would
have been but for such damage or destruction, included in the Transferred
Assets or (ii) any Assumed Liability with respect to a period prior to the
Closing, other than Liabilities included in the calculation of Net Working
Capital (other than, in the case of this clause (ii), where insurance proceeds
are directly or indirectly funded by either Seller or any of its Affiliates
through self-insurance or other similar arrangement). Sellers agree to use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary consents or approvals of
any insurance company or other Third Party relating to any such assignment,
provided, however, that the Buyer shall promptly pay or reimburse the Sellers
for all reasonable costs, fees and expenses (including legal expenses)
incurred in connection with the obligations under this Section 5.5 and
provided, further that the assignment of such proceeds shall be net of any
insurance premiums, retroactive premiums, premium adjustments and any out-of-
pocket costs or expenses associated with the collecting the such proceeds. If
such proceeds are not assignable, Sellers agree to pay any such proceeds
received by it or any of its controlled Affiliates to Buyer promptly upon the
receipt thereof, net of any insurance premiums, retroactive premiums, premium
adjustments and any out-of-pocket costs or expenses associated with the
collecting such proceeds. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.6 Exclusivity. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement (the "Exclusivity
Period"), the Sellers shall not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, discuss, pursue, solicit,
initiate, participate in, facilitate, knowingly encourage or otherwise enter
into any discussions, negotiations, agreements or other arrangements regarding
or which could lead to, a possible sale or other disposition (whether by
merger, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) of all or any part of
the Business with any other Person other than the Buyer or its Subsidiaries
(an "Acquisition Proposal") or provide any information to any Person other
than the Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Representatives in connection with, or
that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal. During
the Exclusivity Period, the Sellers will, and each will cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Representatives to (A) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other
than Buyer) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (B)
terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to
any Person or its Representatives, and (C) promptly request each Person that
has executed a confidentiality agreement in the last twelve (12) months with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all information
heretofore furnished by such Person or its Representatives by or on behalf of
the Sellers. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.7 Further Assurances. After the date of this Agreement, but
prior to the Closing, the Parties will cooperate to identify any other assets
or liabilities, if any, that the Parties mutually agree are required for the
operation of the Business and shall update Schedules I, II, III, IV and V to
this Agreement accordingly. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.8 Access and Information. From the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled,
including through its and their Representatives, to make such investigation of
the Transferred Assets, Assumed Liabilities and services to be provided
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement and the MNSA and such
examination of the Records to the extent related thereto, and to receive such
information, including financial information (including the information set
forth on Schedule VI), as it reasonably requests and to make extracts and
copies of such Records, including reasonable access to customary supporting
information, data and documentation necessary for the preparation of the
Buyer's \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t39  \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tfinancial reports. Any such investigation and examination shall be
conducted after reasonable advance notice under reasonable circumstances and
shall be subject to any restrictions under applicable Law and this Agreement.
The Sellers shall, and shall cause their controlled Affiliates and
Representatives to, cooperate with the Buyer and its Affiliates and their
Representatives in connection with such investigation and examination, and the
Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives shall cooperate with the
respective Representatives of the Sellers and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to minimize any disruption to the business. This Section 5.8 shall
not entitle Buyer or its Representatives to contact any Third Party doing
business with Sellers, access the properties or Records of any such Third
Party or access the properties of the Seller or its controlled Affiliates, in
each case without Seller's prior written consent. No investigation or notice
under this Section 5.8 or otherwise shall (i) alter any representation or
warranty given hereunder by Sellers, any condition to the obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement or Buyer's right to indemnification hereunder or
(ii) modify any section of the Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.8, in no event shall the Sellers
be required to prepare any financial statements with regard to the Business,
the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, whether prior to or
following the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.9 Financing; Financing Cooperation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Buyer shall have sufficient funds available to it at
the Closing to satisfy the payment of the Purchase Price in full. In the
event that the Buyer determines, in its sole discretion, to arrange or obtain
any financing to provide funds in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Financing"), (i) the Buyer shall use, and
shall cause its Affiliates to use, its and their reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Financing is available at Closing and (ii) the Sellers shall
provide, and shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates and
Representatives to provide to the Buyer reasonable assistance and cooperation
as is reasonably requested by the Buyer in connection with arranging,
obtaining and syndicating the Financing, as necessary, including assisting the
Buyer with preparation of customary documents and other materials reasonably
necessary in connection with the Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Section 5.9, in no event shall the Sellers be
required to prepare any balance sheet, cash flow statement, income statement
or statement of stockholder's equity with regard to the Business, the
Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, whether prior to or following
the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer agrees that (i) on
the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, the
Buyer shall promptly reimburse the Sellers for all documented out-of-pocket
Third Party costs and expenses incurred by the Sellers in connection with such
cooperation pursuant to this Section 5.10; and (ii) the Buyer shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Sellers and their respective Affiliates and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all Liabilities, Losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or
any assistance or activities provided in connection therewith. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, it is understood and agreed that the
condition precedent set forth in Section 9.2(b), as applied to the Sellers'
obligations under this Section 5.9, shall be deemed to be satisfied unless the
Financing has not been obtained as a direct result of the Sellers' Willful
Breach of its obligations under this Section 5.9. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Buyer understands and acknowledges that under the terms
of this Agreement, the Buyer's obligation to consummate the transactions
hereunder is not in any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to the
Buyer's consummation of any financing \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tarrangements, the Buyer's obtaining of any financing or the
availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing to the Buyer.
For the avoidance of doubt, if any such financing has not been obtained, the
Buyer shall continue to be obligated, until such time as this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 9, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.10 Notice of Developments. Prior to the Closing and subject to
applicable Laws and as required by any Governmental Authority, Sellers and
Buyer shall each keep the other reasonably apprised of the status of matters
relating to consummation of the Transaction, including promptly furnishing the
other with copies of material notices or other material communications
received by Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, from any Third Party and/or any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Transaction. Prior to the Closing, each Party shall notify the
other Party in writing reasonably promptly after becoming aware of (a) any
event, circumstance, fact or occurrence arising subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which would result in any material breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant of any Party in this Agreement or which could have the
effect of making any representation or warranty of the any Party in this
Agreement untrue or incorrect in any material respect or (b) any other
material developments affecting the Transferred Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.11 Additional Covenants. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing, the Sellers will
provide to the Buyer no later than ten (10) Business Days after the first
(1st) day of each calendar month, an Example Net Working Capital Statement as
of the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding such month. Such
monthly Example Net Working Capital Statements shall be prepared in accordance
with the Agreed Accounting Principles and will be presented in a format that
is substantially similar to the format of the Example Net Working Capital
Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Between the date hereof and the Closing, the Sellers will

wages (as applicable), commission opportunities and hire dates (or service
recognition dates, if different) of all Business Employees. At least thirty
(30) days prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer shall offer employment,
effective as of the Closing Date, to each employee of the Business set forth

Date. For any Business Employee who is on short-term or long-term disability
immediately prior to the Closing Date, at least thirty (30) days prior to the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall offer employment to such Business Employee,
effective as of the date on which such Business Employee returns to active
employment following the Closing (provided that such return to active
employment occurs within twelve (12) months following the Closing Date). In
each case, such offer of employment by the Buyer shall provide, for at least
the twelve (12) month period following the Closing Date, for (i) job
responsibilities and duties that are substantially comparable to each such
Business Employee's job responsibilities and duties immediately prior to the

Date (or, for employees on short-term or long-term disability leave as of
immediately prior to the Closing, such later date as described above). All
such employees to whom the Buyer offers employment and who accept such
employment are herein referred to as the "Transferred Employees". Effective as
of 12:01 a.m. (U.S. Eastern Time) on the Closing Date (or, for employees on
short-term or long-term disability leave as of immediately prior to the
Closing, such later date as described above), each Transferred Employees shall
terminate employment with the Sellers and any of their respective Affiliates,

Affiliates on the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) No later than twenty (20) days prior to the Closing, Buyer
shall provide Sellers with a list of the base salaries or base wages (as
applicable) and commission opportunities set forth in Buyer's offers of
employment to the Business Employees. In addition, Buyer shall promptly
provide Sellers with written notice of any Business Employee who rejects
Buyer's offer of employment (but in no event more than two (2) Business Days

Employee). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.2 Seller Benefit Plans. Effective as of 12:01 a.m. (U.S.
Eastern Time) on the Closing Date (or, for employees on short-term or long-
term disability leave as of the Closing, such later date as described above in
Section 6.1), each Transferred Employee shall cease all active participation
in and accrual of benefits under all Plans (other than the Retention
Agreements). For purposes of Sections 6.4 through 6.7 below, references to
the Closing or the Closing Date shall mean, with respect to employees on
short-term or long-term disability leave as of immediately prior to the
Closing, such later date as described above in Section 6.1. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.3 Benefit Levels. For a period of twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause each Transferred Employee to
be provided with (i) a base salary or base wage and commission opportunities
that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) other benefits that are no less favorable,
in the aggregate, than the benefits provided to similarly situated employees
of the Buyer or its subsidiaries as in effect from time to time. Without
limiting the immediately preceding sentence (or any other provision hereof),
for the twelve (12)â€‘month period following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
provide, or cause to be provided, to each Transferred Employee severance
payments and severance benefits that are no less favorable than the greater of
(i) the severance payments and severance benefits that were provided to such
employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) the severance
payments and severance benefits that are provided to similarly-situated Buyer
employees from time to time. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.4 Service Credit. The Buyer shall cause each Transferred
Employee to be credited with his or her years of service with Sellers and
their Affiliates prior to the Closing for all purposes under each employee
benefit plan, program, arrangement or policy established, sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates in which
the Transferred Employees are eligible to participate on or after the Closing
Date (collectively, the "Buyer Plans"), to the same extent as such Transferred
Employee was entitled to credit for such service under comparable Plans
immediately prior to the Closing, except for benefit accrual under defined
benefit pension plans, for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early
retirement benefits or to the extent that providing such credit would result
in a duplication of benefits. For clarity, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall
recognize the Transferred Employees' service with the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates (and their predecessors) prior to the Closing for the purposes of
(i) accruals and usage of vacation and paid-time-off following the Closing and

Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any and all Buyer Plans that are welfare benefit plans, to the extent
coverage under such Buyer Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Plan in
which such Transferred Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing.
In addition, for purposes of each Buyer Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits, the Buyer shall (i) waive, or cause to
be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to preâ€‘existing conditions and
actively-at-work requirements for each Transferred Employee and his or her
covered spouse, domestic partner or other dependent thereof, and (ii) take
into account or cause to be taken into account any eligible \t\t

the Closing occurs as if such amounts had been paid under such Buyer
Plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.6 401(k) Plan Benefits. Effective no later than the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall establish or designate a defined contribution plan that
includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code (and a related trust exempt from tax under Section
501(a) of the Code) (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan"). Each Transferred Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate in the Buyer 401(k) Plan as of the
Closing Date. The Buyer 401(k) Plan shall (no later than the Closing Date)
accept rollover distributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) from the 401(k) Plan(s) (including
promissory notes evidencing any outstanding loans). To the extent that any
such rollover includes a promissory note, the Buyer agrees to expedite the
acceptance of such rollovers by the Buyer 401(k) Plan in order to avoid loan
defaults. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.7 Liability. Subject to Section 6.1, and without limiting any
other provision of this Agreement, effective as of 12:01 a.m. (U.S. Eastern
Time) on the Closing Date, the Buyer shall be solely responsible for any
severance or separation benefits that become due (a) to any Transferred
Employee as a result of his or her termination by the Buyer after the Closing
or (b) to any Business Employee as a result of the Buyer's failure to offer
employment to or continue the employment of such Business Employee on terms
consistent with this Article 6 and in accordance with applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.8 Retention Incentives. The Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, assume and honor the retention incentive arrangements set forth
on Schedule 6.8 (the "Retention Agreements") and shall pay the retention
bonuses thereunder to the applicable Transferred Employees as and when they
become due in accordance with the terms of such Retention Agreements, subject

following the Closing. In order to facilitate the payment of such Transaction
Bonuses, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the applicable payment
date(s), the Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, deliver to
the Sellers (together with any other information reasonably requested by
Sellers that is necessary to determine whether such Transaction Bonuses have
become payable) a list of the Transferred Employees who have remained in
employment with the Buyer or an Affiliate thereof through the applicable
retention date and are eligible to receive Transaction Bonuses (to the extent
that such Transaction Bonuses otherwise become earned and payable to the
Transferred Employees pursuant to their terms). \t\t

reasonably be requested by either of them in connection with the preparation
of any Tax Return, or the defense of any audit or other examination by any
Taxing Authority or any judicial or administrative Proceeding with respect to
Taxes, and (b) each retain and provide the other with any records or other
information which the other may reasonably request that are relevant to such

Closing Date in an amount equal to the total amount of such Taxes for the

7.3), together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the proration and reimbursement amount. The proration amount shall
be paid by the Party owing it to the other within ten (10) days after delivery
of such statement, absent manifest error. The Party that has the primary
obligation to do so under applicable Law shall file any Tax Return that is
required to be filed in respect of Taxes described in this Section 7.3. The

 \t\t\tTERMINATION \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
before the Closing and the Transaction abandoned: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) by the mutual written consent of the Buyer and the
Sellers; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) by written notice to the Sellers from the Buyer if: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) there is any material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
Sellers, such that the conditions specified in Section 9.1 or Section 9.2
would not be satisfied at the Closing (a "Terminating Sellers Breach"), except
that, if such Terminating Sellers Breach is curable by the Sellers through the
exercise of their reasonable best efforts, then, for a period of up to
fortyâ€‘five (45) days after receipt by the Sellers of notice from the Buyer of
such Terminating Sellers Breach (the "Sellers Cure Period"), such termination
shall not be effective, and such termination shall become effective only if
(A) the Terminating Sellers Breach is not cured within the Sellers Cure Period
or (B) the Terminating Sellers Breach is incapable of being cured during the
Sellers Cure Period; provided that this right of termination shall not be
available to the Buyer if the Buyer is in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) the Closing has not occurred on or before the earlier to
occur of (x) the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of this
Agreement and (y) the Termination Date; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1(b)(ii) shall not be
available to the Buyer if the Buyer's failure to comply with its obligations
under this Agreement has materially contributed to the failure of the Closing
to occur before such date; provided, further, that, if the Termination Date
falls during a Sellers Cure Period, the Termination Date shall automatically
be extended until the end of such Sellers Cure Period; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) by written notice to the Buyer from either Seller if: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) there is any material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
Buyer, such that the conditions specified in Section 9.1 or Section 9.3 would
not be satisfied at the Closing (a "Terminating Buyer Breach"), except that,
if any such Terminating Buyer Breach is curable by the Buyer through the
exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then, for a period of up to forty-
five (45) days after receipt by the Buyer of notice from the Sellers of such
Terminating Buyer Breach (the "Buyer Cure Period"), such termination shall not
be effective and such termination shall become effective only if (A) the
Terminating Buyer Breach is not cured within the Buyer Cure Period or (B) the
Terminating Buyer Breach is incapable of being cured during the Buyer Cure
Period (it being understood and agreed that failure by the Buyer to consummate
the Closing within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the Closing is
required to occur pursuant to Section 10.1 shall be deemed a Terminating Buyer
Breach that is incapable of being cured); provided that this right of
termination shall not be available to the Sellers if the Sellers are in
material breach of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement; or \t\t

Date; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 11.1(c)(ii) shall not be available to the Sellers if either
(i) the Sellers' failure to comply with their obligations under this Agreement
has materially contributed to the failure of the Closing to occur before such
date or (ii) the condition set forth in Section 9.2(c) has not been satisfied
as of such date (only for so long as the condition set forth in Section 9.2(c)
remains unsatisfied); provided, further, that, if the Termination Date falls
during a Buyer Cure Period, the Termination Date shall automatically be
extended until the end of such Buyer Cure Period; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) if any Governmental Authority modifies or imposes a
modification of the terms of the DOJ Final Judgment, this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements and such modifications are not acceptable to the Sellers
in their sole discretion, provided, that in the event that the Sellers enter
into any definitive agreement or amendment approving such modification, or
otherwise consent in writing to any such modification, that shall mean that
such modification is acceptable in form and substance to the Sellers. \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) by any Party by written notice to the other Parties if the
NTM Merger has been validly terminated pursuant to the terms of the NTM Merger
Agreement; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) by written notice to the Buyer from the Sellers if the DOJ
has informed the Sellers in writing that it will not grant the DOJ Consent, or
if the DOJ withdraws or retracts the DOJ Consent and informs the Sellers that
it will not re-grant the DOJ Consent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.2 Effect of Termination. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Section 11.2 and except for the second sentence of Section 14.12, in the event

stockholders, other than liability of a Party for any Willful Breach of this
Agreement by such Party occurring prior to such termination. \t\t

 \t\t\t12.1 Confidentiality. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Effective as of the execution of this Agreement, Buyer and
Sellers have entered into the Amended and Restated Confidentiality Agreement.
The Buyer acknowledges effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Amended
and Restated Confidentiality Agreement shall be automatically terminated and
without further effect; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Party acknowledges that any and all other information provided
to it by or on behalf of the other Party, any of their respective Affiliates
or Representatives as concerning the disclosing party, their respective
Affiliates (other than the Business) and the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall remain subject to the
confidentiality terms of the Confidentiality Agreement until the date that the
Amended and Restated Confidentiality Agreement would have otherwise been
terminated in accordance with its terms and provided, further, that the
obligations not to disclose Transaction Information (as such term is defined
in the Amended and Restated Confidentiality Agreement) to the individuals
identified on Exhibit A of the Amended and Restated Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive any termination thereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) From and after the Closing, the Parties agree that any
information provided to the other Parties or their Representatives pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement (including Section 5.8 or Section 12.2) or
otherwise in connection with the Transaction (including the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, but, in the case of
Buyer, excluding all Business Confidential Information that relates
exclusively to the Business) (the "Confidential Information") shall be kept
strictly confidential, and the Parties and their Representatives shall not
disclose any such Confidential Information in any manner whatsoever, provided,
however, that a Party may disclose any such Confidential Information to such
of its Representatives who have been informed of the confidential nature of
the information and have been instructed to comply with the terms of this
Section 12.1(b) as if they were parties hereto (provided the Parties shall not
disclose any pricing information under the MNSA to actual or potential debt
and equity financing sources; provided, however, that the Buyer may share with
such actual and potential debt and equity financing sources financial
forecasts and models that reflect such pricing information on an aggregated
line item basis), and Trade Secrets subject to Section 8.3 may be disclosed to
sublicensees in accordance with Section 8.3. The term "Confidential
Information" does not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally
available to the public (other than as a result of a disclosure by a Party or
any of its Representatives in breach of this Section 12.1(b)), (ii) (A) was
within such receiving Party's possession prior to it being furnished or
otherwise disclosed to such receiving Party hereunder or (B) thereafter
becomes available to such receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the disclosing Party or its Representatives, in either case
of clause (A) or (B) without, to such receiving Party's knowledge, being
subject to any contractual or other obligation of confidentiality to the
disclosing Party or any of its Representatives with respect to such
information, or (iii) is or was independently developed by the receiving Party
or any of its Representatives without use of, reference to or reliance upon
Confidential Information; provided that the foregoing exceptions (i)-(iii)
shall not apply with respect to any Trade Secrets. In the event that a Party
or any of its Representatives receives a request from a Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction (by deposition, interrogatory, request for
documents, order, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to
disclose, or is otherwise required by Law or the rules of a national
securities exchange to which it is subject, to disclose Confidential
Information then the provisions of Paragraph 2.2 of the Amended and Restated
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any such disclosure and are
incorporated by reference into this Section 12.1(b), mutatis mutandis, as if
they were set forth in their entirety herein. The confidentiality restriction
set forth in this Section 12.1(b) shall expire with respect to any
Confidential Information three (3) years after the date such Confidential
Information is originally provided to a Party or its Representatives by
another Party or its Representatives, provided that this Section 12.1(b) shall
not expire (i) with respect to any Trade Secrets or (ii) with respect to the
obligation not to disclose any pricing information under the MNSA. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, each of the
Sellers shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or
communicate to any Person other than authorized officers, directors, managers
and employees of the Buyer or its Affiliates or use or otherwise exploit, any
Business Confidential Information (x) in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to be detrimental to the Business or (y) for the purposes of
marketing or customer solicitation for the benefit of anyone other than the
Business, the Buyer or its Affiliates. Each of the Sellers and their
respective directors, officers, employees or Affiliates shall not have any
obligation to keep confidential any Business Confidential Information if and
to the extent disclosure thereof is specifically required by Law or requested
by FCC staff in connection with the FCC MNSA Approval. To the extent legally
permissible, such Seller shall notify the Buyer of its intention \t\t

 \t\t\tto make such disclosure and provide a list of the Business
Confidential Information that such Seller intends to disclose prior to making
such disclosure. The Sellers agree to cooperate with the Buyer so that the
Buyer may seek, at its sole cost and expense, an appropriate protective order.
"Business Confidential Information" means any market studies and forecasts,
competitive analyses, target markets, advertising techniques, pricing policies
and information, customer lists, customer profiles, customer preferences,
other trade secrets and any other documents embodying confidential and
proprietary information to the extent related to the Business. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.2 Access to Books and Records; Cooperation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) From and after the Closing, each of the Sellers, the Buyer
and their respective Affiliates shall retain the books, Records, documents,
instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings, evidences, of title and other
papers relating to the Business in their possession or control for at least
seven (7) years following the Closing Date or for such longer period as may be
required by Law or any applicable Governmental Order, and shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to provide the other Party and its
Affiliates and Representatives reasonable access during regular business hours
to such Records (including the right to receive hard or electronic copies
thereof), including to the extent necessary to: (i) fully enforce, determine
or exercise any rights or obligations in connection with the NTM Merger, or
(ii) perform any mandatory obligations towards any Governmental Authorities,
governmentâ€‘controlled entities, public international organizations, or
nonâ€‘governmental institutions whose employees are treated because of that
status or otherwise as government officials under applicable Laws. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, provide such assistance and cooperation to the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates and Representatives as any Seller may
reasonably request in relation to any Proceedings by or against any Seller or
its Affiliates, including Proceedings relating to employee claims. The
Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, provide such
assistance and cooperation at the Buyer's cost and expense to the Buyer and
its Affiliates and Representatives as the Buyer may reasonably request in
relation to required regulatory filings of Buyer or its Affiliates (including
securities law filings) in respect of periods ending on or prior to the
Closing (including providing such information, including financial
information, as is reasonably requested and making extracts and copies of such
Records, including reasonable access to customary supporting information, data
and documentation necessary for the preparation of the Buyer's financial
reports), in connection with any Proceedings, including Proceedings relating
to employee claims, or to the extent reasonably necessary or advisable to
operate the Business after the Closing. The respective Parties shall be
entitled, at their sole cost and expense, to make copies of the Records to
which they are entitled to access pursuant to this Section 12.2.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 12.2, in no
event shall the Sellers be required to prepare any balance sheet, cash flow
statement, income statement or statement of stockholders' equity with regard
to the Business, the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, whether
prior to or following the Closing \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.3 Wrongâ€‘Pocket. If at any time during the five (5)-year period
after the Closing: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates receives
(i) any refund or other amount which is a Transferred Asset or is otherwise
properly due and owing to the Buyer in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or (ii) any refund or other amount which is related to claims or
other matters for which the Buyer is responsible hereunder, and which \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tamount is not an Excluded Asset, or is otherwise properly due and
owing to the Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Sellers
promptly shall remit, or shall cause to be remitted, such amount to the Buyer
at the address set forth in Section 14.11, net of any out-of-pocket expenses
and costs (including Taxes) incurred in connection with determining,
collecting or obtaining such refund or other amount; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Buyer or any of its Affiliates receives (i) any refund
or other amount which is an Excluded Asset or is otherwise properly due and
owing to the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) any refund or other amount which is
related to claims or other matters for which the Sellers are responsible
hereunder, and which amount is not a Transferred Asset, or is otherwise
properly due and owing to the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Buyer promptly shall remit,
or shall cause to be remitted, such amount to the Sellers at the address set
forth in Section 14.11, net of any out-of-pocket expenses and costs (including
Taxes) incurred in connection with determining, collecting or obtaining such
refund or other amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) If at any time after the Closing, the Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries shall receive or otherwise possess any asset or liability that
should belong to the Sellers or any of their Affiliates pursuant to this
Agreement, Buyer shall, except to the extent the asset is not transferable as
provided in Section 12.3(e) promptly notify and transfer, or cause to be
transferred, such asset or liability to the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates. If at any time after the Closing, the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates shall receive or otherwise possess any asset or
liability that should belong to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
this Agreement, the Sellers shall, except to the extent the asset is not
transferable as provided in Section 12.3(e), promptly notify and transfer, or
cause to be transferred, such asset or liability to Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries. Prior to any such transfer of assets pursuant to this Section
12.3(c), the Sellers and the Buyer agree that the Person receiving or
possessing such asset shall hold such asset in trust for the Person to whom
such asset should rightfully belong pursuant to this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) If at any time there exist (i) assets that any Party
discovers were, contrary to the agreements among the Parties, by mistake or
unintentional or other omission, transferred to Buyer or retained by Sellers
or any of their respective Affiliates or (ii) Liabilities that any Party
discovers were, contrary to the agreements among the Parties, by mistake or
unintentional or other omission, assumed by Buyer or retained by Sellers or
any of their respective Affiliates, then the Parties shall cooperate in good
faith to effect the transfer or retransfer of such misallocated assets, and/or
the assumption or reassumption of misallocated Liabilities, to or by the
appropriate Person as promptly as practicable and shall not use the
determination that remedial actions need to be taken to alter the original
intent of the Parties with respect to the assets to be transferred to or
Liabilities to be assumed by Buyer or retained by Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates. Each Party shall reimburse any other Party or make
other financial adjustments or other adjustments to remedy any mistakes or
omissions relating to any of the assets transferred or any of the Liabilities
assumed or retained pursuant to this Section 12.3(d). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any Ancillary Agreement
shall constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer, convey, deliver or
assume any asset that would constitute a Transferred Asset if such asset is
not transferable in accordance with applicable Law or with any requisite
Consent. If the transfer or assignment of any asset intended to be
transferred or \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t55  \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tassigned hereunder is not consummated prior to or on the Closing Date,
whether as a result of a prohibition on transfer due to a violation or breach
of applicable Law or any other requisite Consent, then the Person retaining
such asset shall thereafter hold such asset for the use and benefit, insofar
as legally permitted and reasonably possible, of the Person entitled thereto
until the consummation of the transfer or assignment thereof (or as otherwise
mutually determined by the Parties). In addition, the Person retaining such
asset shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such other actions as may
reasonably be requested by the Person to whom such asset is to be transferred
in order to place such Person, insofar as legally permitted and reasonably
possible, in the same position as if such asset had been transferred as
contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such
asset, including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and
dominion, control and command over such asset, are to inure from and after the
Closing Date to the Person to whom such asset is to be transferred.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such asset shall still be considered a
Transferred Asset. This provision is intended, among other things, to cause
all such assets that are considered Transferred Assets to be treated for all
income tax and accounting purposes as if transferred as contemplated hereby,
such that such assets are and will be, for all income tax and accounting
purposes, owned by the Buyer, and the Parties will so treat such assets for
all income tax and accounting purposes, except as required by Law. The Person
retaining an asset due to the deferral of the transfer and assignment of such
asset shall not be obligated, in connection with the foregoing, to expend any
money or personnel in connection with the maintenance of the asset unless the
necessary funds or expenses or costs associated with such maintenance are
advanced by the Person to whom such asset is to be transferred, other than
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, attorneys' fees and recording or similar
fees, all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by the Person to whom such
asset is to be transferred; provided, however, that the Person retaining such
asset shall, as promptly as practicable, provide notice to the Person to whom
such asset is to be transferred of the amount of all such expenses and
fees. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Each Party hereto shall cooperate with each other Party
hereto and shall set up procedures and notifications as are reasonably
necessary or advisable to effectuate the transfers contemplated by this
Section 12.3. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the transfer or assumption of
any assets or Liabilities under this Section 12.3 shall be effected without
any additional consideration payable by any Party hereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.4 Transfer Formalities and Costs. Without limiting Section
14.1, all registration, filing and other formalities relating to or required
for the transfer of the Transferred Assets shall be the sole responsibility of
the Buyer. The Buyer shall pay all costs and expenses associated with or
arising from the transfer of the Transferred Assets. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.5 Insurance. Except as set forth in Section 2.3(b), from and
after the Closing, the Business, the Transferred Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities shall cease to be insured by Sellers' or their respective
Affiliates' insurance policies or by any of their self-insurance programs or
other similar arrangements, and Buyer (i) agrees to arrange for its own
insurance policies (including self-insurance or similar arrangements funded
directly or indirectly by Buyer or any of its Affiliates) with respect to the
Business, the Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities covering all
periods from and after the Closing and (ii) without prejudice to any right to
indemnification under this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, agrees
not to seek, through any means, to benefit from any of Seller's or its
Affiliates' insurance policies which may provide coverage for claims relating
in any way to the Business. \t\t

 \t\t\t12.6 Non-Solicitation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) From and after the Closing and until the eighteen
(18)-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Sellers shall not, and shall
cause each of their respective Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,
solicit for employment or engagement, knowingly entice away, or hire or engage
(whether as an employee, consultant, agent, contractor or otherwise) any
Transferred Employee who is at or above a Consultant/Manager position;
provided that the Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall not be
precluded from soliciting, hiring or engaging any such person: (i) pursuant to
a general solicitation of employment not targeted toward employees of the
Buyer or its Affiliates, or (ii) whose employment or engagement, as
applicable, with the Buyer or its Affiliates has been terminated at least six
(6) months prior to such soliciting, hiring or engaging with the Sellers or
their respective Affiliates. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Scope. The Parties acknowledge that the restrictions
contained in this Section 12.6(a) are reasonable in scope and duration in
light of the nature, size and location of the Business. The Parties further
acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this Section 12.6(a) are
necessary to protect Buyer's significant investment in the Business, including
investment in goodwill. It is the desire and intent of the Parties that the
provisions of this Section 12.6(a) be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under applicable Law. If any part of this Section 12.6 is held to
be excessively broad as to duration, scope activity or subject, such part will
be construed by limited and reducing it so as to be enforceable to the maximum
extent permitted under applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.7 Additional Post-Closing Covenants. The Parties shall take the
actions described on Schedule 12.7. \t\t

 \t\t\t13.3 Indemnification Claims. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) An Indemnified Party shall give written notification to the
Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any Third Party Claim. Such
notification shall be given within thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Indemnified Party of notice of such Third Party Claim, and shall describe in
reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party) the facts
constituting the basis for such Third Party Claim and the amount of damages
claimed therein (if specified); provided, however, that no delay or failure
on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party
shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation hereunder
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such delay or failure. Within twenty (20) days after delivery of
such notification, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to, upon
written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of and
conduct, at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense, the defense of
such Third Party Claim (with counsel of national standing reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party); provided, that (i) as a condition
precedent to the Indemnifying Party's right to assume and conduct such
defense, within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice
of such Third Party Claim, (A) the Indemnifying Party must notify the
Indemnified Party in writing that the Indemnifying Party shall undertake the
defense of such Third Party Claim and (B) the Indemnifying Party must agree in
writing with the Indemnified Party to unconditionally indemnify the
Indemnified Party from and against all such Losses that the Indemnified Party
may suffer or incur or to which the Indemnified Party may otherwise become
subject and which arise from or as a result of or are connected with such
Third Party Claim (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 13.6), and
(ii) the Indemnifying Party may not assume control of the defense of or
conduct the defense of, any Third Party Claim to the extent such claim
constitutes a Third Party Claim (A) involving any criminal or quasi-criminal
Proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation or seeking to
impose any criminal penalty, fine or other sanction, (B) made by any
Governmental Authority or to which any Governmental Authority is a named
party, (C) in which relief other than monetary Losses is sought, including any
injunctive or other equitable relief, (D) which, if adversely determined,
would reasonably be expected, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified
Party, to establish a precedent, custom or practice materially adverse to the
continuing business interests or prospects of the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates, or (E) that could, in the good faith judgment \t\t

  \t\t\t58  \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tof the Indemnified Party, reasonably be expected to result in Losses
in excess of the Cap (and for purposes of any claims with respect to breaches
of the representations and warranties other than the Seller Fundamental
Representations or the Buyer Fundamental Representations, as applicable) or
otherwise in excess of the maximum liability of the Seller Indemnifying
Parties or the Buyer Indemnifying Parties, as applicable under this Article
13. For avoidance of doubt, in the event that a Seller or one or more of its
Affiliates and the Buyer or one or more of its Affiliates is named in an
Proceeding, such Seller and the Buyer shall be entitled to assume the control
of and conduct of their own defense and select counsel of their own choosing
to defend their respective interests in such Proceeding. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) If the Indemnifying Party does not so assume or does not
have the right to so assume control of the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Nonâ€‘Controlling Party may
participate in such defense, and may hire separate counsel at its own expense.
The Controlling Party shall keep the Nonâ€‘Controlling Party reasonably advised
of the status of such Third Party Claim and the defense thereof and shall
consider in good faith recommendations made by the Nonâ€‘Controlling Party with
respect thereto. The Nonâ€‘Controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party
with such information as it may have with respect to such Third Party Claim
(including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have
been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or
other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise
reasonably cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of
such Third Party Claim, including by (i) furnishing and, upon request,
procuring the attendance of potential witnesses for interview, preparation,
submission of witness statements and the giving of evidence at any related
hearing, (ii) promptly furnishing documentary evidence to the extent available
to it or its Affiliates, and (iii) providing access to any other relevant
party, including any Representatives of the Nonâ€‘Controlling Party as
reasonably needed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party with respect to a Third Party Claim shall be
considered Losses for purposes of this Agreement only if (A) the Indemnified
Party shall have determined in good faith that an actual or potential conflict
of interest makes representation by the same counsel or the counsel selected
by the Indemnifying Party inappropriate or (B) the Indemnifying Party shall
have authorized in writing the Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel at
the Indemnifying Party's expense. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to
any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), unless
the relief consists solely of money Losses to be paid by the Indemnifying
Party. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) In order to seek indemnification under this Article 13, an
Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying
Party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Within twenty (20) days after delivery of a Claim Notice,
the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written
response (the "Response"), in which the Indemnifying Party shall: (i) agree
that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount
(in which case the Response shall be accompanied by a payment by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Claimed Amount, by check or
by wire transfer), (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
receive the part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the "Agreed Amount") (in
which case the Response shall be accompanied \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tby a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the
Agreed Amount, by check or by wire transfer), or (iii) dispute that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount (whereupon
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party agree that the dispute shall
be resolved in accordance with Section 14.5). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants. The
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.15(a) and
3.18 (the "Seller Fundamental Representations") and Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.6
(the "Buyer Fundamental Representations") shall survive the Closing for three
(3) years from the Closing Date and then expire. All representations and
warranties in this Agreement other than the Seller Fundamental Representations
and Buyer Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing for eighteen
(18) months from the Closing Date. All covenants and agreements set forth
herein which by their terms contemplate actions or impose obligations prior to
or at the Closing shall survive the Closing for eighteen (18) months from the
Closing Date and then expire. All covenants and agreements set forth herein
which by their terms contemplate actions or impose obligations following the
Closing shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. If an Indemnified Party delivers to an
Indemnifying Party, before expiration of a representation or warranty or
covenant or agreement, either a Claim Notice based upon a breach of such
representation or warranty, or an Expected Claim Notice based upon a breach of
such representation or warranty or covenant, then the applicable
representation or warranty or covenant shall survive until, but only for
purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered in reasonable detail by such
notice. If the Proceeding or written claim with respect to which an Expected
Claim Notice has been given is definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of
the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly so notify the
Indemnifying Party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.5 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any payments made to
an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 13 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes and such treatment
shall govern for all purposes hereof except to the extent that the applicable
Laws or Taxing Authority of a particular jurisdiction require otherwise. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.6 Limitations on Indemnification. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) No amount shall be payable to an Indemnified Party in
satisfaction of any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 13.1(a) or
13.2(a), as applicable, for which the aggregate amount of Losses of the
Indemnified Party arising therefrom, together with all related claims, is less
than $50,000; provided, that the limitation set forth in this Section 13.6(a)
shall not apply unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses of the
Indemnified Party resulting from, arising out of or relating to breaches of
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement exceeds the
Deductible Amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) No claim may be made by an Indemnified Party against an
Indemnifying Party for indemnification pursuant to Section 13.1(a) or Section
13.2(a), as applicable, unless and until the Indemnified Party has sustained
aggregate Losses for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 13.1(a) or Section 13.2(a), as applicable, in excess of $14,000,000 in
the aggregate (the "Deductible Amount") and then only to the extent such
aggregate amount exceeds the Deductible Amount, provided, however, that the
Deductible Amount shall not apply with respect to any Losses resulting from,
arising out of or relating to breaches of the Seller Fundamental
Representations or the Buyer Fundamental Representations, and none of such
Losses shall count towards the satisfaction of the Deductible Amount. The
maximum aggregate recovery of the Indemnified Parties from the

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tParties pursuant to Section 13.1(a) or Section 13.2(a), as applicable,
shall not exceed an amount equal to $140,000,000 the ("Cap"), except with
respect to breaches of the Seller Fundamental Representations or Buyer
Fundamental Representations, which are subject to Section 13.6(c). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The maximum aggregate liability or recovery of all Buyer
Indemnified Parties from all Seller Indemnifying Parties under this Article 13
or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, including for Fraud, shall not exceed
an amount equal to the Final Purchase Price actually received by the Sellers.
The maximum aggregate liability or recovery of all Seller Indemnified Parties
from all Buyer Indemnifying Parties under this Article 13 or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement, including for Fraud, shall not exceed an amount
equal to the Final Purchase Price actually received by the Sellers and the
Sellers shall have no indemnification for Losses under this Article 13 by any
Indemnified Party if such Liabilities are taken into account in the
calculation of Net Working Capital. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
be indemnified, paid or reimbursed more than once for the same Losses. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.7 Exclusivity of Remedy for Monetary Damages. The Buyer and the
Sellers acknowledge and agree that indemnification pursuant to this Article 13
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties for money
damages for any and all Losses from and after the Closing in connection with
any breach of a representation or warranty or nonâ€‘performance of any covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement; provided, that in the event of (a)
any breach of the representation or warranty of the Company contained in
Section 3.15, Buyer shall be entitled to elect to receive such services in
accordance with Section 1.5 of the Transition Services Agreement and the
Sellers shall have no further liability with respect to any related breach of
representation or warranty of the Sellers contained in Section 3.15 hereunder
and (b) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Sellers set forth in
Section 2.1, Buyer shall be entitled to elect to receive the transfer and
delivery of such assets, rights or properties to cure such breach, and Sellers
shall be promptly obligated to comply with such election. In the event such
election is made and complied with, such amounts shall not be considered for
any purposes set forth in Section 13.6 hereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.8 Effect of Insurance and Other Recoveries. The amount of any
Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Article 13 shall be
reduced by any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right
of indemnification (less the amount of the actual costs and expenses incurred
in procuring such proceeds). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.9 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified
Party's right to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected
or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party (including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of
the fact that the Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or
should have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or might be
inaccurate or that any such covenant or agreement is, was or might have been
breached or not fulfilled or by reason of the Indemnified Party's waiver of
any condition set forth in Section 9.2 or Section 9.3, as applicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.10 Mitigation. The Buyer and each of the Sellers shall use its
respective commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any claim or liability
that a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable,
asserts under this Article 13. The Indemnified Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to recover from insurance policies or other applicable sources of
recovery the maximum portion of any Losses of such Indemnified Party. \t\t

 \t\t\t13.11 No Recourse. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements may
only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising
out of, or related to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the Persons that
are expressly named as parties hereto or thereto and then only with respect
to, and to the extent of, the specific obligations set forth herein and
therein with respect to such party. Except to the extent a named party to this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (and then only to the extent of the
specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements and not otherwise), no past, present or future equity
holder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, agent, attorney,
Affiliate, member, manager, general or limited partner, stockholder, investor
or assignee of any party to this Agreement, nor any past, present or future
equity holder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, agent,
attorney, Affiliate, member, manager, general or limited partner, stockholder,
investor or assignee of any of the foregoing, shall have any liability or
obligation (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or
more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of the Sellers or the Buyer under this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements (whether for indemnification or otherwise) of or for
any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tARTICLE 14 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tMISCELLANEOUS \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.1 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each Party shall bear its own expenses and the expenses of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein,
including all fees and expenses of any of its Representatives. Each Party
shall each bear the fees and expenses of any broker, finder or investment bank
retained by such Party or Parties and their respective Affiliates in
connection with the Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchase
Price represents the consideration agreed among the Parties for the
Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities and does not include any costs
or expenses, including fees and other charges, incurred in connection with the
preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transaction which shall be payable in accordance with this Section
14.1. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.2 Further Actions. Each of the Parties hereto shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action,
do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law and execute and deliver such documents and other papers as may
be required to consummate the Transaction and transfer all of the Transferred
Assets and Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, no requirement to use "reasonable best efforts" under this
Agreement shall require any Party or its Subsidiaries to pay any consent or
similar fees to a Third Party or to agree to any adverse amendment to any
Contract or any concession with any Third Party. For avoidance of doubt, this
Agreement does not create any obligation on the Sellers to consummate the NTM
Merger or take any actions to close the NTM Merger other than those provided
in the NTM Merger Agreement and the Sellers shall not have any liability to
Buyer as a result of any failure of the NTM Merger to be consummated or as a
result of the termination of the NTM Merger Agreement in accordance with its
terms. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.3 Governing Law. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without \t\t

such principles or rules would require or permit the application of Laws of
another jurisdiction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.4 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE
OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14.4. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.5 Submission to Jurisdiction. Any Proceedings based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Transaction shall be
brought exclusively in the federal courts located in the State of New York,
and, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York located therein, provided,
however, that if such federal courts have finally determined that they do not
have jurisdiction over such Proceeding, such Proceeding shall be heard and
determined exclusively in any New York state court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan of The City of New York, and, in each case, appellate courts
therefrom. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of each such court in any such Proceedings, waives any objection
it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience
of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Proceedings shall be heard
and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any Proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transaction in any other
court (including state court prior to the time that a final determination of
non-jurisdiction has occurred). Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to
affect the right of any Party to serve process in any manner permitted by Law
or to commence Proceedings or otherwise proceed against any other Party in any
other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any
Proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 14.5. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.6 Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge that, in view
of the uniqueness of the Business and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the Sellers and the Buyer would not have an adequate remedy
at law for money damages in the event that this Agreement has not been
performed in accordance with its terms, and therefore agrees that, in addition
to all other remedies available at law or in equity, the other Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other (as applicable). Each of the Sellers
and the Buyer agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other
Party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.7 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement
executed by the Parties. \t\t

 \t\t\t14.8 No Assignment. The Buyer may assign its rights, interest or
obligations under this Agreement to any of the direct or indirect Subsidiaries
of Buyer, provided that (a) no such assignment shall relieve the Buyer of its
obligations to the Sellers hereunder and (b) the assignment will not result in
any incremental Taxes or other costs or expenses for which any Seller or any
Affiliate of any Seller would be responsible, provided that with respect to
clause (b), such Seller's or Affiliate's remedy shall be a reimbursement of
such costs and expenses. Either Seller may assign its rights, interest or
obligations under this Agreement to any of its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries, provided that (a) no such assignment shall relieve such Seller
of its obligations to the Buyer hereunder and (b) the assignment will not
result in any incremental Taxes or other costs or expenses for which the Buyer
or any of its Affiliate would be responsible, provided that with respect to
clause (b), the Buyer's or such Affiliate's remedy shall be a reimbursement of
such costs and expenses. Other than the preceding, neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any
Party without the prior written consent of the Buyer, in the case of
assignment by any Seller, and of the Sellers, in the case of any assignment by
the Buyer. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.9 Waiver. The Parties' rights and remedies are cumulative and
not alternative. Any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement which may be
lawfully waived may be waived in writing at any time by each Party which is
entitled to the benefits thereof. Any waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement by any Party shall be binding only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party. No failure or delay in exercising any
right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to
in this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege shall be deemed to or shall preclude any other or
further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any
other right, power, or privilege hereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.10 Withholding. The Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payments to be made hereunder only such amounts, if any,
that it is required to deduct and withhold on account of Taxes under
applicable Law; provided, however, that Buyer shall use reasonable best
efforts to give the Sellers written notice (including reasonable detail
regarding the basis for such withholding and the amount of the proposed
withholding) at least ten (10) Business Days before any such deduction or
withholding and cooperate with the Sellers to mitigate or eliminate any such
withholding to the extent permitted by applicable Law. To the extent any
amounts are so deducted and withheld in accordance with the previous sentence,

 \t\t\t14.12 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the other documents and
writings referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto (including the
Ancillary Agreements and, with respect to Sprint and TMUS only, the NTM Merger
Agreement) contain the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Each of Sprint (for itself and its Affiliates and the
Parent Affiliates) and TMUS (for itself and its Affiliates and the Parent
Affiliates) agrees that the entry into, and performance of its respective
obligations under, this Agreement, are consistent with and in furtherance of
each party's obligations under the NTM Merger Agreement, and that such actions
shall not (i) be deemed to amend, modify the terms of or expand the
obligations of the parties under the NTM Merger Agreement, and (ii) so long as
the performance of such party's obligations under this Agreement are in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, serve as a basis for a claim of
breach of any applicable representation, warranty or covenant by such party in
the NTM Merger Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.13 Publicity. From and after the date hereof, the Parties will
consult with each other and will mutually agree upon any publication or press
release of any nature with respect to this Agreement or the Transaction and
shall not issue any such publication or press release prior to such
consultation and agreement except (i) as may be required by applicable Law or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any securities exchange
or any securities exchange rule or regulation, (ii) to the extent the
information contained in such publication or press release relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby is substantially consistent
with the information included in a press release or other public statement to
which the Parties have previously mutually agreed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and for avoidance of doubt, this Section 14.13 shall not limit
TMUS's and Sprint's ability to issue publications or press releases relating
to the NTM Merger, including publications or press releases that specifically
reference the Transaction. The Parties agree that the initial press release to
be issued with respect to the Transaction shall be in the form agreed by the
Parties. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.14 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is
determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without affecting in any way
the remaining provisions hereof in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any
other provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
other jurisdiction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.15 Third Parties. Nothing herein expressed or implied is intended
or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person or corporation,
other than the Parties and their \t\t

remedies or claims under or by reason of this Agreement or any provision of
this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.16 Waiver of Conflicts. Latham and Watkins LLP, DLA Piper, Cleary
Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz have acted as
legal counsel to the TMUS, its Affiliates and its Parent Affiliates prior to
the Closing and Morrison and Foerster LLP and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP has acted as legal counsel to Sprint, its Affiliates and its Parent
Affiliates prior to the Closing (each such legal counsel, "Prior Counsel").
Each Prior Counsel intends to act as legal counsel to the Sellers, their
respective Affiliates and their respective Parent Affiliates after the
Closing. The Buyer hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its
Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with Prior
Counsel representing the Sellers, their respective Affiliates or their
respective Parent Affiliates after the Closing to the extent such
representation relates to the Business or the Transaction. All communications
involving attorneyâ€‘client confidences between the Sellers, their respective
Affiliates and their respective Parent Affiliates and Prior Counsel in the
course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transaction
(the "Counsel Communications") shall be deemed to be attorneyâ€‘client
confidences that belong solely to the Sellers, their respective Affiliates and
their respective Parent Affiliates. Accordingly, the Buyer shall not have
access to any such communications, or to the files of Prior Counsel relating
to its engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.17 Bulk Transfer Laws. The Buyer hereby waives compliance by the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates with the provisions of any bulk sales,
bulk transfer or other similar Laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the
Transaction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.18 No Other Duties. The only duties and obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement are as specifically set forth in this Agreement,
and no other duties or obligations shall be implied in fact, Law or equity, or
under any principle of fiduciary obligation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.19 Counterparts and Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy
of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement. Any signed counterpart of this
Agreement may be delivered by facsimile or other form of electronic
transmission (e.g., pdf), with the same legal force and effect as delivery of
an originally signed agreement. \t\t
