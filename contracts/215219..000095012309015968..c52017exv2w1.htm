 Section 2.1. _Effect on Vowel Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Vowel Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or the holders of any securities of any of the Parties: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Vowel Common Stock_. Each share of Vowel Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares, the " _Vowel Shares_ ," and each, a " _Vowel Share_ "), other than Vowel Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ and other than Vowel Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the consideration set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) immediately below: 

  

 (i) subject to the election procedures set forth in _Section 2.1(e)_, (X) one fully paid and non-assessable share of Holdco Common Stock (the " _Vowel Per Share Stock_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _Consideration_ "), or (Y) the sum of $6.50 in cash without interest thereon,
as such figure may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to _Section
2.1(f)_ (as may be adjusted, the " _Vowel Per Share Cash Consideration_ ");
_plus_  

  

 (ii) the Vowel Per Share Pre-Closing Tax Refund Consideration; _plus_  

  

 (iii) the Contingent Value Right. 

 

The aggregate consideration set forth in the immediately preceding clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) is referred to collectively herein as the " _Vowel
Consideration_ ". 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Converted Shares_. Each Vowel Share that has been converted into the right to receive a portion of the Vowel Consideration as provided in this _Section 2.1_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Vowel Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Vowel Shares other than the right to receive: (i) the consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to this _Section 2.1_; (ii) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with _Section 2.3(e)_; and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Holdco Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_. 

  

 (c) _Vowel and Consonant-Owned Shares_. Each Vowel Share that is owned by Vowel, as treasury stock, any wholly owned Subsidiary of Vowel or that is owned by Consonant or Holdco immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Vowel Shares held on behalf of third parties or held in trust to fund Vowel or Consonant obligations) (the " _Cancelled Vowel Shares_ ") shall be cancelled without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation. 

  

 (d) _Conversion of Vowel Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Vowel Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Vowel Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Vowel Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Vowel Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Vowel Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

  

 (e) _Election Procedures_. 

  

 (i) Concurrent with the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in connection with the Vowel Meeting (the " _Mailing Date_ "), Vowel shall mail, or shall cause to be mailed, an election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials prepared by Holdco (the " _Election Form_ ") to each holder of record of Vowel Common Stock as of the Vowel Record Date. 

  

 (ii) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify (A) the 

   ##### 

  

    

number of Vowel Shares with respect to which such holder elects to receive
the Vowel Per Share Stock Consideration (the " _Stock Election Shares_ "),
(B) the number of Vowel Shares with respect to which such holder elects to
receive the Vowel Per Share Cash Consideration (the " _Cash Election Shares_
") or (C) that such holder makes no election with respect to such holders
Vowel Shares (the " _No Election Shares_ "). Any Vowel Shares with respect to
which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed
Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m. (New York time), on the Business Day
immediately prior to the day of the Vowel Meeting (such prior Business Day,
the " _Election Deadline_ ") shall be deemed to be No Election Shares. 

  

 (iii) Vowel shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by any Person who becomes a holder (or beneficial owner) of Vowel Common Stock between the Vowel Record Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election Deadline, and Vowel shall provide the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein. 

  

 (iv) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a duly executed and properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form, only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, unless a subsequent properly completed Election Form is submitted and actually received by the Exchange Agent by the Election Deadline, the Vowel Shares represented by such Election Form shall become No Election Shares. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion in consultation with Holdco and Vowel to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any reasonable good faith decision of Holdco regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Holdco shall have the right to make rules, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity and effectiveness of Election Forms and the manner and extent to which Election Forms are to be taken into account in making determinations by this _Section 2.1_. Neither Holdco, Vowel, Consonant nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form. 

  

 (v) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall effect the allocation among the holders of record of Vowel Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time of rights to receive the Vowel Consideration in the Vowel Merger in accordance with this Agreement and the properly completed and duly submitted Election Forms, unless the number of Cash Election Shares is greater than the number of Available Cash Election Shares, in which case: 

  

 A. the Exchange Agent shall identify among all Eligible Cutback Persons, and, notwithstanding anything in such Eligible Cutback Persons Election Form to the contrary, shall re-designate a number of each such Eligible Cutback Persons Cash Election Shares as Stock Election Shares (the " _Re-Designated Shares_ ") that is equal to the product (rounded up to the nearest whole number) derived from the following formula: (x) the Cutback Number, _multiplied by_ (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of such Eligible Cutback Persons Cash Election Shares reflected in its Election Form, and the 

   ##### 

  

    

denominator of which is aggregate number of Cash Election Shares reflected in
the Election Forms submitted by all Eligible Cutback Persons; 

  

 B. each Stock Election Share, No Election Share and Re-Designated Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Vowel Per Share Stock Consideration, plus the Vowel Per Share Pre-Closing Tax Refund Consideration, plus the Contingent Value Right; and 

  

 C. each Cash Election Share that is not a Re-Designated Share will be converted into the right to receive the Vowel Per Share Cash Consideration, plus the Vowel Per Share Pre-Closing Tax Refund Consideration, plus the Contingent Value Right. 

  

 (vi) In the event the number of Cash Election Shares is equal to or less than the number of Available Cash Election Shares, (X) each Stock Election Share and each No Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Vowel Per Share Stock Consideration, plus the Vowel Per Share Pre-Closing Tax Refund Consideration and the Contingent Value Right, and (Y) each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Vowel Per Share Cash Consideration, plus the Vowel Per Share Pre-Closing Tax Refund Consideration and the Contingent Value Right. 

  

 (f) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Vowel or Consonant, or in the securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock of Vowel or Consonant, shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, merger (other than the Holdings III Merger Transactions) or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration and any number or amount contained in this Agreement which is based on the number of shares of Vowel Common Stock or Consonant Common Stock (including without limitation, the Consonant Exchange Ratio, the Vowel Per Share Stock Consideration, the Vowel Per Share Cash Consideration and the Contingent Value Right), as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change so that the conversion of capital stock contemplated in the Mergers shall continue to provide the same economic effect as before such change; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this  _Section 2.1(f)_ shall be construed to permit Vowel or Consonant to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (g) _Vowel Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Vowel Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Vowel Shares) and that are held by holders of such Vowel Shares who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Vowel Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to receive the Vowel Consideration, and holders of such Vowel Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Vowel Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until any such holder fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to, appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the 

   ##### 

  

    

Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses such right, such Vowel Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as
if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Vowel Per Share Stock Consideration,
plus the Vowel Per Share Pre-Closing Tax Refund Consideration and the
Contingent Value Right in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Agreement. At the Effective Time, any holder of Vowel Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. Vowel shall
give Consonant, before or at the Effective Time, or Holdco, following the
Effective Time, (i) prompt notice of any demands received by Vowel for
appraisals of Vowel Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other
demand, notice or instrument delivered to Vowel prior to the Effective Time
that relate to such demand and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and
demands. Vowel shall not, except with the prior written consent of Consonant,
before or at the Effective Time, or Holdco, following the Effective Time
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle any such
demands. 

  

 Section 2.2. _Effect on Consonant Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Consonant Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or the holders of any securities of any of the Parties: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Consonant Common Stock_. Each share of Consonant Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares, the " _Consonant Shares_ ," and each, a " _Consonant Share_ "), other than Cancelled Consonant Shares, shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive, (i) that number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to the Consonant Exchange Ratio (the " _Consonant Stock Consideration_ ") and (ii) the right to subscribe from time to time for additional fully paid and non-assessable shares of Holdco Common Stock pursuant to the Holdco Warrant, in the form of _Exhibit F_ annexed hereto and made a part hereof (each, a " _Holdco Warrant_ "). The Consonant Stock Consideration, together with the Holdco Warrant, are collectively referred to herein as the " _Consonant Consideration_ " and, together with the Vowel Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ". The holder of record of Consonant Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall receive a Holdco Warrant, which shall provide that it is exercisable for a number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to the Consonant Specified Asset Recoupment Amount. The Holdco Warrant shall be subject to customary registration rights in favor of the holder thereof and its permitted successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein or in any Transaction Documents: (x) immediately prior to the Effective Time and after giving effect to the Holdings III Merger Transactions, a total of 24,209,264 Consonant Shares shall be issued and outstanding and no other equity or debt securities of Consonant shall be outstanding; (y) 20,454,312 shares of Holdco Common Stock in the aggregate shall be issued pursuant to this  _Section 2.2_ upon conversion of the Consonant Shares in the Consonant Merger; and (z) after giving effect to the Consonant Merger and the issuance of the Additional Shares, VSS-Consonant Holdings III shall hold 24,300,466 shares of Holdco Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent the number of shares of Vowel Common Stock outstanding immediately prior the Effective Time is greater or less than 

   ##### 

  

    

29,874,145, the number of shares of Holdco Common Stock issued pursuant to
clauses (y) and (without duplication) (z) above shall be increased or
decreased, respectively, so that the Consonant Shares shall convert into the
same percentage of shares of Holdco Common Stock immediately after the
Effective Time as would have been the case had the number of shares of
Vowel Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time been 29,874,145. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Converted Shares_. All Consonant Shares that have been converted into the right to receive Consonant Consideration as provided in this _Section 2.2_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Consonant Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Consonant Shares other than the right to receive: (i) the consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to this _Section 2.2_; (ii) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with _Section 2.3(e)_; and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Holdco Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_. 

  

 (c) _Consonant and Holdco-Owned Shares_. Each Consonant Share that is owned by Consonant, as treasury stock, any wholly owned Subsidiary of Consonant or that is owned by Holdco immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Consonant Shares held on behalf of third parties or held in trust to fund Consonant obligations) (the " _Cancelled Consonant Shares_ ") shall be cancelled without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation. 

  

 (d) _Conversion of Consonant Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Consonant Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Consonant Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Consonant Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Consonant Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Consonant Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

  

 Section 2.3. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, (x) Holdco shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Wells Fargo, N.A. (or such other exchange agent as Holdco shall select, pursuant to an agreement with such other exchange agent in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Holdco) (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Vowel Shares and Consonant Shares (as applicable), certificates representing a number of shares of Holdco Common Stock and Contingent Value Rights sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this Agreement, and the sum of $25,000,000 in immediately available funds, (y) Vowel shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, the sum in immediately available funds equal to the Available Vowel Cash for Cash Election (less an amount equal to the Vowel Expense Reimbursement Amount) and the Available Vowel Cash for Tax Refund Consideration, and (z) Vowel and/or Holdco, in each case to the extent provided in 

   ##### 

  

    

 _Section 7.3(a)_, shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (or cause to be
deposited with the Exchange Agent), a sum equal to the Vowel Expense
Reimbursement Amount in immediately available funds (all such cash,
certificates representing shares of Holdco Common Stock and Contingent
Value Rights, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, to be issued and paid
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ in exchange, as the case may
be, for (A) all of the Vowel Shares (excluding the Cancelled Vowel Shares and
Vowel Dissenting Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
issuable and payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented Vowel Shares (each, " _Vowel
Certificate_ " and collectively, the " _Vowel Certificates_ ") or non-
certificated Vowel Shares represented by book-entry (the " _Vowel Book-Entry
Shares_ "); and (B) all of the Consonant Shares (excluding the Cancelled
Consonant Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
issuable and payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented Consonant Shares (each, a "
_Consonant Certificate_ " and collectively, the " _Consonant Certificates_ ",
and together with the Vowel Certificates, a " _Certificate_ " or,
collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") (or, in either case, effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by the Exchange Agent,
the posting by the holder of such Certificate of a bond in customary amount
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate). 

  

 (b) Each holder of Vowel Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Vowel Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Vowel Certificates, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Vowel Book-Entry Shares, (A) a certificate for Holdco Shares, a check or wire transfer, and a CVR, in each case, in the amount and to the extent to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to this _Article II_, (B) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with _Section 2.3(e)_, and (C) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Holdco Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_. The shares of Holdco Common Stock constituting part of such Vowel Consideration, at Holdcos option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested by a given holder of shares of Vowel Common Stock or is otherwise required under applicable Law, in which case, a physical certificate shall be delivered to such holder. The CVR constituting part of such Vowel Consideration shall be given in uncertificated book-entry form. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Vowel Certificate or Vowel Book-Entry Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Vowel Consideration (including, in the case of Vowel Per Share Stock Consideration, any dividends or distributions in accordance with _Section 2.3(e)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_). 

  

 (c) Each holder of shares of Consonant Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Consonant Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Consonant Certificates (A) a certificate for the number of Holdco Shares in the amount and to the extent which such holder may be entitled pursuant to _Article II_; (B) a Holdco Warrant to subscribe for the number of Holdco Shares to which such holder may be entitled to purchase pursuant to _Article II_; (C) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with _Section 2.3(e)_; and (D) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Holdco Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_. The shares of Holdco Common Stock constituting part of such Consonant Consideration, at Holdcos option, 

   ##### 

  

    

shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is
requested by a given holder of shares of Consonant Common Stock or is
otherwise required under applicable Law, in which case a physical certificate
shall be delivered to such holder. Until so surrendered or transferred,
as the case may be, each such Consonant Certificate shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Consonant
Consideration (including any dividends or distributions in accordance with
_Section 2.3(e)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with _Section 2.3(f)_). 

  

 (d) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be issued or paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Vowel Book-Entry Share, as the case may be, is registered, it shall be a condition to such issuance or payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Vowel Book-Entry Share, as the case may be, shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Vowel Book-Entry Share, or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Holdco Common Stock issued pursuant to the Mergers shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Vowel Book-Entry Shares until such Certificates or Vowel Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this _Section 2.3_. Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the shares of Holdco Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, an amount equal to all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such shares of Holdco Common Stock with a record date on or after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, an amount equal to the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Holdco Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. 

  

 (f) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock or certificates for scrip representing such fractional shares, shall be issued in the Mergers. All fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock that a holder of Vowel Shares or Consonant Shares would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the applicable Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest thereon determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing sales price (or, if the closing sale price is not then available, the average of the high bid and the low ask price) of one share of Vowel Common Stock on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board market (or such other market on which such Vowel Shares are then trading) two Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a holder of Holdco Common Stock. 

  

 (g) _Payment Procedures_. 

  

 A. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day following the Closing Date, the 

   #####

 (a) Vowel has filed all required reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents with the SEC since December 31, 2005 (such documents, together with any documents filed during such period by Vowel with the SEC on a voluntary basis on Current Reports on Form 8-K, the " _Vowel SEC Reports_ "). As of their respective filing dates, the Vowel SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, " _SOX_ ") applicable to such Vowel SEC Reports, and none of the Vowel SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Vowel has made available to Consonant true, correct and complete copies of all material correspondence received from the SEC, on the one hand, and responded to by Vowel, on the other, since December 31, 2006, including without limitation all material SEC comment letters and material responses to such 

   ##### 

  

    

comment letters by or on behalf of Vowel. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff
with respect to the Vowel SEC Reports. To the Knowledge of Vowel, as of the
date hereof, none of the Vowel SEC Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC
review or outstanding SEC comment. 

  

 (b) The financial statements (including the related notes and schedules) of Vowel included in, or incorporated by reference into, the Vowel SEC Reports (the " _Vowel SEC Financial Statements_ ") comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vowel as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes). _Section 3.6(b)_ of the Vowel Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete copy of the audited balance sheet of Vowel as of December 31, 2008, and the related audited consolidated statements of income (loss), changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for Vowel, for the fiscal year then ended (the " _Vowel 2008 Financial Statements_ ", and together with the Vowel SEC Financial Statements, the " _Vowel Financial Statements_ "). Vowel has no current intention to correct or restate, and to the Knowledge of Vowel, there is not any basis to correct or restate any of the Vowel SEC Financial Statements. Vowels auditors have not delivered any written reports to the Vowel audit committee expressing any disagreement as to material accounting matters or policies during any of Vowels past three full fiscal years or during the current fiscal year-to-date. Vowel is not a party to, nor has any commitment to become a party to, any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC). 

  

 (c) Each of the principal executive officer of Vowel and the principal financial officer of Vowel has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Vowel SEC Reports, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate.

Vowel has no outstanding, and has not arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX. 

  

 (d) Vowel has established and maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined by paragraph (f) of Rules 13a-15 of the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Vowels management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Vowels internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2008, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. The assessment of the effectiveness of Vowels internal controls over financial reporting has been attested to by Whitley Penn LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in the Vowel SEC Reports. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Vowels "disclosure controls and procedures" (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Vowel in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to Vowels management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Vowel required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Vowel has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to Vowels outside auditors and the audit committee of the Vowel Board (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which are known to Vowel and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, known to Vowel that involves management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial statements or Vowels internal control over financial reporting.

None of Vowel nor its Subsidiaries has any Liability that is required to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Vowel prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for Liabilities (a) disclosed in _Section 3.8_ of the Vowel Disclosure Schedule, (b) expressly contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, (c) as expressly disclosed in any Vowel SEC Report, (d) reflected or reserved against in the Vowel Financial Statements or (e) incurred in the ordinary course of business since the Balance Sheet Date and is not material to Vowel and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any change, event or occurrence that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Vowel Material Adverse Effect.

As of the date of this Agreement, there are not pending or, to the Knowledge of Vowel, threatened in writing, any audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings in respect of Taxes of Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries and neither Vowel nor any of its Subsidiaries has given any currently effective waiver of any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes.

 Section 3.10. _Intellectual Property_. 

  

 (a) _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Vowel Disclosure Schedule lists all registrations, and all applications for registration, of Vowel Intellectual Property, including the record owner thereof and the Governmental Authorities by which each item of Vowel Intellectual Property has been registered or in which any such application has been filed. Each registration of Vowel Intellectual Property is valid and subsisting, all necessary registration, maintenance and renewal fees currently due in connection therewith have been paid, and all necessary documents and certificates in connection therewith have been filed with the relevant Governmental Authority (including, but not limited to, the United States Patent and Trademark Office or equivalent authority anywhere in the world) for the purposes of maintaining such registration. Neither Vowel nor any of its Subsidiaries has misrepresented any facts or circumstances, or failed to disclose any facts or circumstances known to it, in connection with any such registration, or in connection with the application for registration of any other Intellectual Property, that would constitute fraud with respect to such registration or application. 

  

 (b) _Section 3.10(b)_ of the Vowel Disclosure Schedule lists any material proceedings or actions before any Governmental Authority related to any registration of any Vowel Intellectual Property. 

  

 (c) Vowel and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps to maintain their rights in the Vowel Intellectual Property and in all registrations and applications for registration of the Vowel Intellectual Property. 

  

 (d) Vowel or one or more of its Subsidiaries owns all Vowel Intellectual Property free and clear of any Liens, excluding any non-exclusive license rights granted to customers in the ordinary course of business. All Vowel Intellectual Property is the work product of Employees of Vowel or its Subsidiaries and belongs to Vowel or its Subsidiaries as a matter of law, or has been acquired by valid and enforceable written assignment. No third party has any rights to any material Vowel Intellectual Property other than non-exclusive license rights granted to customers in the ordinary course of business. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Employee of Vowel and its Subsidiaries who in the normal course of his or her duties is or was involved in the creation of Vowel Intellectual Property has entered into one or more Contracts with Vowel or one of its Subsidiaries, and/or otherwise has a legal duty to Vowel or one of its Subsidiaries, sufficient to vest title in Vowel or such Subsidiary of all Intellectual Property created by such Employee in the scope of his or her employment or consultancy, as the case may be, with Vowel or such Subsidiary. It is not and will not be necessary for Vowel to utilize any Intellectual Property of any of its or any of its Subsidiaries Employees (or persons it or they currently intend to hire) created prior to their employment by Vowel or any Subsidiary, or, if necessary, such Employees have entered into valid and enforceable written assignments conveying all rights in such Intellectual Property to Vowel or its Subsidiaries. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) All Vowel Intellectual Property is fully transferable, alienable, and licensable to any Person whatsoever by Vowel and its Subsidiaries without restriction and without payment of any kind to any third party, subject, however, to any non-exclusive license rights granted to customers in the ordinary course of business. 

  

 (f) Vowel or one or more of its Subsidiaries has acquired and currently holds written or electronic licenses permitting Vowel and its Subsidiaries to use and incorporate each and every item of Vowel Third Party Intellectual Property that is necessary to, or used by Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries in the operation of, the business of Vowel and its Subsidiaries as each is currently conducted and has been conducted within the six (6) years prior to the date of this Agreement, including all products and services currently distributed, licensed or provided to customers by Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries or proposed to be distributed, licensed or provided to customers within the next twelve months. Except with respect to non-exclusive licenses for generally available commercial off-the-shelf software programs, each such license associated with any products or services distributed, licensed or provided by Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries is valid throughout the world, of perpetual duration, non-terminable by the licensor except for breach or insolvency of the licensor, assignable without restriction or condition, and fully sublicensable within the scope of the license granted. There is no outstanding unresolved claim, and to the Knowledge of Vowel, there is no basis for any claim, that Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of any such license. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Vowel and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not cause Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries to be in violation or default under any such license or entitle any other party to terminate or modify any such license. 

  

 (g) The Vowel Intellectual Property, together with the Vowel Third Party Intellectual Property, constitutes (i) all Intellectual Property used by Vowel and its Subsidiaries in the operation of the business of Vowel and its Subsidiaries as each is currently conducted, has been conducted within the six (6) years prior to the date of this Agreement, and is currently proposed to be conducted in the future, and (ii) all Intellectual Property necessary to the operation of the business of Vowel and its Subsidiaries as each is currently conducted, has been conducted within the six (6) years prior to the date of this Agreement, and is currently proposed to be conducted within the next twelve months. 

  

 (h) No Vowel Intellectual Property, and to the Knowledge of Vowel, no Vowel Third Party Intellectual Property, is subject to any Court Order, any Proceeding in which a Court Order is sought, or any agreement, that does or would in any manner restrict, condition and/or materially affect the validity or enforceability thereof, or the use, transfer or licensing thereof by Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (i) No Public Intellectual Property (as defined below) has been or is incorporated in, or distributed in conjunction with, in whole or in part, any Vowel Intellectual Property or any Vowel Third Party Intellectual Property; and no Vowel Intellectual Property has been distributed in whole or in part as Public Intellectual Property. " _Public Intellectual Property_ " means Intellectual Property distributed under a free, open source, or other similar licensing or distribution model, including, but not limited to, the GNU General Public License, the Mozilla Public License, or any Creative Commons License. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (j) There is no outstanding unresolved demand or claim, and to the Knowledge of Vowel, there is no basis for any demand or claim, that the operation of the business of Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries or any act, product, technology or service of Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries infringes, misappropriates, or dilutes any Intellectual Property of any Person (including, without limitation, any demand or request that Vowel or any Subsidiary license any rights from a third party). Neither Vowel nor any of its Subsidiaries has received, at any time during the six-year period preceding the date hereof, or, to the Knowledge of Vowel, is aware of any facts that indicate a likelihood of receiving, written notice from any Person directing Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries to review or consider the applicability of such Persons Intellectual Property Rights to the business of Vowel or any Subsidiary and/or the Vowel Intellectual Property. 

  

 (k) To the Knowledge of Vowel, no Person is infringing, misappropriating, or diluting, or is intending to infringe, misappropriate, or dilute, any Vowel Intellectual Property or any Vowel Third Party Intellectual Property in which Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries is the owner or exclusive licensee. 

  

 (l) Vowel and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps to ensure that their Employees have not disclosed to them any information that is subject to any restriction of confidentiality in favor of any prior employer or other Person. 

  

 (m) Vowel and its Subsidiaries have taken all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all Trade Secrets. During the six (6) years prior to the date hereof, (i) there have been no material security breaches in Vowels or any of its Subsidiaries information technology systems, and (ii) there have been no disruptions in any of Vowels or its Subsidiaries information technology systems that have adversely affected in any material respect Vowels or any of its Subsidiaries business or operations. 

  

 (n) Vowel and its Subsidiaries have at all times complied with all applicable Law, as well as its own rules, policies, and procedures, relating to privacy, data protection, and the collection and use of personal information collected, used, or held for use by Vowel and its Subsidiaries in the conduct of its business, including but not limited to the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act. No claims have been asserted or threatened against Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries alleging a violation of any Persons privacy or personal information or data rights and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not breach or otherwise cause any violation of any Law or rule, policy, or procedure related to privacy, data protection, or the collection and use of personal information collected, used, or held for use by Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries in the conduct of their business. Each of Vowel and its Subsidiaries take reasonable measures to ensure that such information is protected against unauthorized access, use, modification, or other misuse. 

  

 Section 3.11. _Title to Properties; Leases; Assets_. Vowel and each Subsidiary of Vowel has good and valid title to, and is the lawful owner of, or has the right to use pursuant to a lease, license or otherwise, all the tangible and intangible personal property used in its business free and clear of all Liens and material defects, except for Permitted Liens and for defects in title, easements, restrictive covenants and similar encumbrances that, individually or in the aggregate, 

   ##### 

  

    

have not had or would not reasonably be expected to materially interfere with
the continuous use of the property for the purposes for which the property is
currently used. Neither Vowel nor any Subsidiary of Vowel owns any real
property or has any option to acquire any real property. _Section 3.11_ of
the Vowel Disclosure Schedule sets forth all real property leases of Vowel
and its Subsidiaries (including all amendments, extensions, renewals,
guarantees and other agreements with respect thereto), and Vowel
has delivered or made available true and complete copies of all such leases
or other agreements. All such leases are valid, binding and enforceable
against Vowel or one of its Subsidiaries (and, to the Knowledge of Vowel,
each other party thereto) in accordance with their respective terms,
Vowel has not received any written notice of a material default by Vowel or
any such Subsidiary, as the case may be, under any such lease that remains
outstanding. Vowel has not given any written notice of a material default by
any other party to any such lease that remains outstanding, and there
does not exist, under any lease of real property, any default or any event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default by
Vowel or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, or to the Knowledge of Vowel,
by any other party thereto, except for a default that, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had or would not reasonably be expected to materially
interfere with the continuous use of the property for the purposes for which
the property is currently used. Vowel and each Subsidiary enjoys peaceful and
undisturbed possession of all real property under all leases identified on
_Section 3.11_ of the Vowel Disclosure Schedule. Neither Vowel nor any of
its Subsidiaries have assigned, sublet or otherwise transferred any interest
in any such lease, and no other Person has any rights to the use, occupancy
or enjoyment of any real property governed thereby pursuant to any lease,
sublease, license, occupancy or other agreement. All leases of real property
will continue to be legal, binding, and enforceable and in full force and
effect immediately following the Closing Date in accordance with the terms in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. Vowel and each of its
Subsidiaries has all of the rights, properties and assets (real, personal,
mixed, tangible or intangible) that are necessary or desirable for the conduct
of their respective business (the " _Vowel Assets_ ") and there are no
defects in the Vowel Assets that materially interfere with the operation
thereof. No Person (including any Affiliate of Vowel or any Subsidiary of
Vowel) owns or has any interest by lease, license or otherwise in any of
Vowel Assets. The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents at the
Closing will be sufficient to convey good and marketable title to the Vowel
Assets to the Vowel Surviving Corporation free any clear of any Lien, except
for any Lien which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Vowel Material Adverse Effect. The representations
and warranties contained in this _Section 3.11_ do not apply to Intellectual
Property which is covered exclusively by the representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 3.10_ hereof.

Neither Consonant nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of any Person (other than Consonant or such Subsidiaries) pursuant to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement, under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of Law), as a transferee or successor, or otherwise. As of the date of this Agreement, there are not pending or, to the Knowledge of Consonant, threatened in writing, any audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings in respect of Taxes of Consonant or any of its Subsidiaries and neither Consonant nor any of its Subsidiaries has given any currently effective waiver of any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes.

 (a) _Section 4.10(a)_ of the Consonant Disclosure Schedule lists all registrations, and all applications for registration, of Consonant Intellectual Property, including the record owner thereof and the Governmental Authorities by which each item of Consonant Intellectual Property has been registered or in which any such application has been filed. Each registration of Consonant Intellectual Property is valid and subsisting, all necessary registration, maintenance and renewal fees currently due in connection therewith have been paid, and all necessary documents and certificates in connection therewith have been filed with the relevant Governmental Authority (including, but not limited to, the United States Patent and Trademark Office or equivalent authority anywhere in the world) for the purposes of maintaining such registration. Neither Consonant nor any of its Subsidiaries has misrepresented any facts or circumstances, or failed to disclose any facts or circumstances known to it, in connection with any such registration, or in connection with the application for registration of any other Intellectual Property, that would constitute fraud with respect to such registration or application.

 (c) Consonant and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps to maintain their rights in the Consonant Intellectual Property and in all registrations and applications for registration of the Consonant Intellectual Property. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) Consonant or one or more of its Subsidiaries owns all Consonant Intellectual Property free and clear of any Liens, excluding any non-exclusive license right granted to customers in the ordinary course of business. All Consonant Intellectual Property is the work product of Employees of Consonant or its Subsidiaries and belongs to Consonant or its Subsidiaries as a matter of law, or has been acquired by valid and enforceable written assignment. No third party has any rights to any material Consonant Intellectual Property other than non-exclusive license rights granted to customers in the ordinary course of business. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Employee of Consonant and its Subsidiaries who in the normal course of his or her duties is or was involved in the creation of Consonant Intellectual Property has entered into one or more Contracts with Consonant or one of its Subsidiaries, and/or otherwise has a legal duty to Consonant or one of its Subsidiaries, sufficient to vest title in Consonant or such Subsidiary of all Intellectual Property created by such Employee in the scope of his or her employment or consultancy, as the case may be, with Consonant or such Subsidiary. It is not and will not be necessary for Consonant to utilize any Intellectual Property of any of its or any of its Subsidiaries Employees (or persons it or they currently intend to hire) created prior to their employment by Consonant or any Subsidiary, or, if necessary, such Employees have entered into valid and enforceable written assignments conveying all rights in such Intellectual Property to Consonant or its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (e) All Consonant Intellectual Property is fully transferable, alienable, and licensable to any Person whatsoever by Consonant and its Subsidiaries without restriction and without payment of any kind to any third party, subject, however, to any non-exclusive license rights granted to customers in the ordinary course of business. 

   

 (f) Consonant or one or more of its Subsidiaries has acquired and currently holds written or electronic licenses permitting Consonant and its Subsidiaries to use and incorporate each and every item of Consonant Third Party Intellectual Property that is necessary to, or used by Consonant or any of its Subsidiaries in the operation of, the business of Consonant and its Subsidiaries as each is currently conducted and has been conducted within the six (6) years prior to the date of this Agreement, including all products and services currently distributed, licensed, or provided to customers by Consonant or any of its Subsidiaries or proposed to be distributed, licensed or provided to customers within the next twelve months. Except with respect to non-exclusive licenses for generally available commercial off-the-shelf software programs, each such license associated with any products or services distributed, licensed or provided by Consonant or any of its Subsidiaries is valid throughout the world, of perpetual duration, non-terminable by the licensor except for breach or insolvency of the licensor, assignable without restriction or condition, and fully sublicensable within the scope of the license granted. There is no outstanding unresolved claim, and to the Knowledge of Consonant, there is no basis for any claim, that Consonant or any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of any such license. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Consonant and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not cause Consonant or any of its Subsidiaries to be in violation or default under any such license or entitle any other party to terminate or modify any such license. 

   

 (g) The Consonant Intellectual Property, together with the Consonant Third Party Intellectual Property, constitutes (i) all Intellectual Property used by Consonant and its Subsidiaries in the operation of the business of Consonant and its Subsidiaries as each is 

   ##### 

  

   

currently conducted, has been conducted within the six (6) years prior to the
date of this Agreement, and is currently proposed to be conducted in the
future, and (ii) all Intellectual Property necessary to the operation of the
business of Consonant and its Subsidiaries as each is currently conducted,
has been conducted within the six (6) years prior to the date of
this Agreement, and is currently proposed to be conducted within the next
twelve (12) months. 

   

 (h) No Consonant Intellectual Property, and to the Knowledge of Consonant, no Consonant Third Party Intellectual Property, is subject to any Court Order, any Proceeding in which a Court Order is sought, or any agreement, that does or would in any manner restrict, condition and/or materially affect the validity or enforceability thereof, or the use, transfer or licensing thereof by Consonant or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (i) No Public Intellectual Property (as defined below) has been or is incorporated in, or distributed in conjunction with, in whole or in part, any Consonant Intellectual Property or any Consonant Third Party Intellectual Property; and no Consonant Intellectual Property has been distributed in whole or in part as Public Intellectual Property. 

   

 (j) There is no outstanding unresolved demand or claim, and to the Knowledge of Consonant, there is no basis for any demand or claim, that the operation of the business of Consonant or any of its Subsidiaries or any act, product, technology or service of Consonant or any of its Subsidiaries infringes, misappropriates, or dilutes any Intellectual Property of any Person (including, without limitation, any demand or request that Consonant or any Subsidiary license any rights from a third party). Neither Consonant nor any of its Subsidiaries has received, at any time during the six-year period preceding the date hereof, or, to the Knowledge of Consonant, is aware of any facts that indicate a likelihood of receiving, written notice from any Person directing Consonant or any of its Subsidiaries to review or consider the applicability of such Persons Intellectual Property Rights to the business of Consonant or any Subsidiary and/or the Consonant Intellectual Property. 

   

 (k) To the Knowledge of Consonant, no Person is infringing, misappropriating, or diluting, or is intending to infringe, misappropriate, or dilute, any Consonant Intellectual Property or any Consonant Third Party Intellectual Property in which Consonant or any of its Subsidiaries is the owner or exclusive licensee. 

   

 (l) Consonant and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps to ensure that their Employees have not disclosed to them any information that is subject to any restriction of confidentiality in favor of any prior employer or other Person. 

   

 (m) Consonant and its Subsidiaries have taken all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all Trade Secrets. During the six (6) years prior to the date hereof, (i) there have been no material security breaches in Consonants or any of its Subsidiaries information technology systems, and (ii) there have been no disruptions in any of Consonants or its Subsidiaries information technology systems that have adversely affected in any material respect Consonants or any of its Subsidiaries business or operations. 

   

 (n) Consonant and its Subsidiaries have at all times complied with all applicable Law, as well as its own rules, policies, and procedures, relating to privacy, data 

    ##### 

  

    

protection, and the collection and use of personal information collected,
used, or held for use by Consonant and its Subsidiaries in the conduct of its
business, including but not limited to the Childrens Online Privacy
Protection Act. No claims have been asserted or threatened against Consonant
or any of its Subsidiaries alleging a violation of any Persons privacy or
personal information or data rights and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not breach or otherwise cause any violation of any
Law or rule, policy, or procedure related to privacy, data protection, or the
collection and use of personal information collected, used, or held for use
by Consonant or any of its Subsidiaries in the conduct of their business. Each
of Consonant and its Subsidiaries take reasonable measures to ensure that
such information is protected against unauthorized access, use, modification,
or other misuse. 

   

 Section 4.11. _Title to Properties; Leases; Assets_. Consonant and each Subsidiary of Consonant has good and valid title to, and is the lawful owner of, or has the right to use pursuant to a lease, license or otherwise, all the tangible and intangible personal property used in its business free and clear of all Liens and material defects, except for Permitted Liens and for defects in title, easements, restrictive covenants and similar encumbrances that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had or would not reasonably be expected to materially interfere with the continuous use of the property for the purposes for which the property is currently used. Neither Consonant nor any Subsidiary of Consonant owns any real property or has any option to acquire any real property. _Section 4.11_ of the Consonant Disclosure Schedule sets forth all real property leases of Consonant and its Subsidiaries (including all amendments, extensions, renewals, guarantees and other agreements with respect thereto), and Consonant has delivered or made available true and complete copies of all such written leases or other agreements. All such leases are valid, binding and enforceable against Consonant or one of its Subsidiaries (and, to the Knowledge of Consonant, each other party thereto) in accordance with their respective terms, Consonant has not received any written notice of a material default by Consonant or any such Subsidiary, as the case may be, under any such lease that remains outstanding. Consonant has not given any written notice of a material default by any other party to any such lease that remains outstanding, and there does not exist, under any lease of real property, any default or any event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default by Consonant or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, or to the Knowledge of Consonant, by any other party thereto, except for a default that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had or would not reasonably be expected to materially interfere with the continuous use of the property for the purposes for which the property is currently used. Consonant and each Subsidiary enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession of all real property under all leases identified on _Section 4.11_ of the Consonant Disclosure Schedule. Neither Consonant nor any of its Subsidiaries have assigned, sublet or otherwise transferred any interest in any such lease, and no other Person has any rights to the use, occupancy or enjoyment of any real property governed thereby pursuant to any lease, sublease, license, occupancy or other agreement. All leases of real property will continue to be legal, binding, and enforceable and in full force and effect immediately following the Closing Date in accordance with the terms in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. Consonant and each of its Subsidiaries has all of the rights, properties and assets (real, personal, mixed, tangible or intangible) that are necessary or desirable for the conduct of their respective business (the " _Consonant Assets_ ") and there are no defects in the Consonant Assets that materially interfere with the operation thereof. No Person (including any Affiliate of Consonant or any Subsidiary of Consonant) owns or has any interest by lease, license or otherwise in any of 

   ##### 

  

    

Consonant Assets. The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents at
the Closing will be sufficient to convey good and marketable title to the
Consonant Assets to the Consonant Surviving Corporation free any clear of any
Lien, except any Liens which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Consonant Material Adverse Effect. The
representations and warranties contained in this _Section 4.11_ do not apply
to Intellectual Property which is covered exclusively by the representations
and warranties set forth in _Section 4.10_ hereof.

Consonant or the applicable 

    ##### 

  

    

Subsidiary has performed all material obligations required to be performed by

 Section 4.24. _Inventory_. The inventories (net of returns and allowances) shown on the Consonant Financial Statements as of the Balance Sheet Date or thereafter acquired by Consonant or its Subsidiaries consist of items of a quantity and quality usable or saleable in the ordinary course of business.

notice that it will experience in the foreseeable future any difficulty in
obtaining, in the desired quantity and quality and at a reasonable price and
upon reasonable terms and conditions, the raw materials, supplies or

Since the Balance Sheet Date, due provision has been made on the books of
Consonant and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in the ordinary course of

modification, amendment, waiver, act or omission would be reasonably likely to

 (xx) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, knowingly take any action that will likely result in the representations and warranties set forth in (A) with respect to Vowel, _Article III_ and (B) with respect to Consonant, _Article IV_ , becoming false or inaccurate in any material respect; and 

  

 (xxi) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions. 

  

 Section 5.2. _Access_. 

  

 (a) Each of Consonant and Vowel shall afford to the officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and agents and other representatives of the other Party and its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable notice and as coordinated through such Partys General Counsel, Chief Financial Officer or other authorized representative throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, to its and its Subsidiaries properties, contracts, commitments, books and records. In addition, Consonant, Holdco and Vowel shall (and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other Party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning its business, finances, operations, properties, assets and personnel as the requesting Party may reasonably request. The foregoing notwithstanding, neither Consonant nor Vowel shall be required to afford such access if it determines in good faith that such access would constitute a violation of any applicable Law. 

   

 (b) Each of Vowel and Consonant agree that all information provided to the other Party or its Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be "Evaluation Material," as such term is used in, and shall be treated in accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreements. 

   

 Section 5.3. _Vowel No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) Subject to _Section 5.3(b)_, Vowel agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary of Vowel shall, and that it shall cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries, proposals or offers (including any proposal from or offer to Vowels stockholders) that will lead to or would constitute a Vowel Alternative Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer (including any proposal from or offer to Vowels stockholders) that is reasonably likely to lead to a Vowel Alternative Proposal; (ii) engage, continue or participate in any negotiations concerning, or provide or cause to be provided any information or data relating to Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with, or have any discussions with any Person relating to, or that is reasonably likely to lead to, a Vowel Alternative Proposal; (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Vowel Alternative 

    ##### 

  

    

Proposal or a Vowel Superior Proposal; or (iv) execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to any Vowel
Alternative Proposal or a Vowel Superior Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
it is understood and agreed that any determination or action by the Vowel
Board permitted under _Section 5.3(b)_ or _(c)_ , shall not, in and of
itself, be deemed to be a breach or violation of this _Section 5.3(a)_ or,
in the case of _Section 5.3(b)_ , give Consonant a right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_. Vowel shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations with
any Person conducted heretofore regarding any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, a Vowel Alternative Proposal or a
Vowel Superior Proposal, and immediately after the public announcement of
this Agreement shall request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished to such Person(s) within the
last three months for the purpose of evaluating a possible Vowel Alternative
Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.3(a)_ by any Representative or
Affiliate of Vowel or any Subsidiary, whether or not such Person is
purporting to act on behalf of Vowel or any Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be
deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.3(a)_ by Vowel. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.3(a)_, at any time prior to the Vowel Stockholder Approval, Vowel may, in response to an unsolicited written Vowel Alternative Proposal received after the date hereof (so long as such Vowel Alternative Proposal did not result from a breach of _Section 5.3(a)_ by Vowel, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives or Affiliates), if the Vowel Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors, that such Vowel Alternative Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a Vowel Superior Proposal and with respect to which the Vowel Board determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel, that such action is required in order for the Vowel Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Vowel stockholders under applicable Law, (A) furnish non-public information with respect to Vowel and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Vowel Alternative Proposal and its Representatives and potential debt and equity financing sources pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (in accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.3(e)_), and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such Vowel Alternative Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Vowel shall contemporaneously provide or make available to Consonant (subject to the Vowel Confidentiality Agreement) any non-public information concerning Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to the Person making such Vowel Alternative Proposal or its Representatives which was not previously provided or made available to Consonant (in which case, Vowel shall so advise Consonant that such was previously provided), and (ii) the Person making such Vowel Alternative Proposal becomes party to a confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic information furnished to such Person on Vowels behalf that is no less favorable to Vowel than the Vowel Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (c) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.3(c)_, neither the Vowel Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Consonant or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Consonant, the Vowel Recommendation, (ii) approve, recommend or take any position other than to recommend rejection (including modifying any recommendation of rejection) of, any Vowel Alternative Proposal, (iii) cause or 

    ##### 

  

    

permit Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into (or publicly propose
that Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries enter into) approve or recommend any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option
agreement or similar agreement constituting or relating to, or that is
intended to be or would reasonably be likely to result in, any Vowel
Alternative Proposal or Vowel Superior Proposal or (iv) approve or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend any Vowel Alternative
Proposal or Vowel Superior Proposal or any agreement, understanding or
arrangement relating to any Vowel Alternative Proposal or Vowel Superior
Proposal, except for a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section
5.3(b)_ entered into in the circumstances referred to in _Section 5.3(b)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to receipt
of the Vowel Stockholder Approval, the Vowel Board shall be permitted (i) not
to recommend to Vowels stockholders approval and adoption of this Agreement
and the Vowel Merger, (ii) to withdraw or modify (in a manner adverse to
Consonant) the Vowel Recommendation (a " _Change of Vowel Recommendation_ "),
(iii) to approve or recommend any Vowel Superior Proposal and/or (iv) take
any other actions that would otherwise be prohibited under the first sentence
of this _Section 5.3(c)_, but only if (A) Vowel, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives and Affiliates have complied with the terms
of this _Section 5.3_, (B) Vowel has received an unsolicited Vowel
Alternative Proposal which the Vowel Board (or any committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors, constitutes a Vowel Superior Proposal, (C) the Vowel Board (or any
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that such action is required in order for the Vowel
Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Vowel stockholders
under applicable Law, (D) Vowel has delivered a prior written notice advising
Consonant and Holdco that it intends to take such action (which notice shall
include a copy of any materials and terms and conditions provided to Vowel by
the Person making the Vowel Superior Proposal, including the identity of such
Person) and (E) during the four (4) Business Day period following receipt
by Consonant and Holdco of such written notice, Vowel and its Representatives
shall negotiate in good faith with Consonant and/or Holdco and their
respective Representatives to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Vowel Superior Proposal ceases
to constitute a Vowel Superior Proposal or does not require the Vowel Board
to make a Change of Vowel Recommendation in order to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to the Vowel stockholders under applicable Law and (F)
following the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Vowel Board shall
have determined in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors,
taking into account any adjustments proposed by Consonant and/or Holdco to
Vowel to the terms of this Agreement, that the Vowel Superior Proposal giving
rise to such notice continues to constitute a Vowel Superior Proposal. Vowel
acknowledges and agrees that each successive modification to the financial
terms or other material terms of a Vowel Alternative Proposal that is
determined to be a Vowel Superior Proposal shall be deemed to constitute a
new Vowel Superior Proposal for purposes of this _Section 5.3(c)_ and shall
require a new compliance with the second sentence of this  _Section 5.3(c)_
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall require a new four (4) Business
Day notice period following Consonants receipt of notice of, and all
materials relating to, such modified Vowel Alternative Proposal th at is
determined to be a Vowel Superior Proposal). 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in _Section 5.3_ shall be deemed to prohibit Vowel from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012 of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to Vowels stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the 

    ##### 

  

    

Vowel Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the making of
such disclosure is required to comply with such rules and regulations;
_provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall Vowel, the Vowel Board or any
committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by
_Section 5.3(c)_. Nothing in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit Vowel or the
Vowel Board from making any "stop, look and listen" communications to the
stockholders of Vowel as limited by and pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act and such communication shall not constitute a Change of Vowel
Recommendation under this Agreement (including _Article VII_ ); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Vowel, the Vowel Board or any committee
thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by
_Sections 5.3(a)_ or _(c)_. 

   

 (e) Vowel promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) shall advise Consonant orally and in writing of (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers reasonably expected to lead to a Vowel Alternative Proposal, (ii) any request for information relating to Vowel or its Subsidiaries reasonably expected (in the good faith judgment of the Vowel Board) to lead to a Vowel Alternative Proposal and (iii) any inquiry or request for discussion or negotiation that would reasonably be expected to result in a Vowel Alternative Proposal, including in each case a copy of the materials (including, without limitation, any written inquiry, term sheet, letter of intent, proposal, offer or other indication of interest) provided to Vowel by such Person, the identity of the Person making any such Vowel Alternative Proposal, indication, inquiry, offer or request reasonably expected to lead to a Vowel Alternative Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any such Vowel Alternative Proposal or indication, inquiry or offer reasonably likely to lead to a Vowel Alternative Proposal. Vowel shall keep Consonant and Holdco reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and details (including any material changes to the terms thereof) and material discussions or negotiations regarding any such Vowel Alternative Proposal, indication, inquiry or offer reasonably likely to lead to a Vowel Alternative Proposal or any material developments relating thereto and promptly provide Consonant and Holdco with all copies of all written material communications and other material documents that reflect the terms of such Vowel Alternative Proposal, indication, inquiry or offer reasonably likely to lead to a Vowel Alternative Proposal (Vowel agreeing that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits Vowel from providing such information to Consonant). 

   

 Section 5.4. _Filings; Other Actions_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, each of Vowel, Consonant and Holdco shall cooperate in preparing the Registration Statement and Holdco shall cause the Registration Statement to be filed with the SEC upon approval thereof by Vowel and Consonant, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included in the Registration Statement as a prospectus and will constitute a part of the Registration Statement. Subject to _Section 5.3(c)_, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall contain the Vowel Recommendation. Each of Vowel, Consonant and Holdco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC, to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in definitive form to be mailed to Vowels stockholders as promptly as practicable after the 

    ##### 

  

    

Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each of
Vowel, Consonant and Holdco will notify the other parties, as promptly as
practicable after the receipt thereof, of any written comments, and advise
each other of any oral comments, from the SEC or its staff and of any request
by the SEC or its staff or any other Governmental Authority for amendments or
supplements to the Filings or for additional information, and will supply the
other parties with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other
Governmental Authority, on the other hand, with respect to the Filings, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the shares of Holdco Common
Stock issuable pursuant to the Mergers. Vowel, Consonant and Holdco shall
cooperate and provide the other Parties with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Filings prior to
filing such with the SEC, and each will provide each other with a copy of all
such filings made with the SEC. No amendment or supplement to any Filing will
be made by Vowel or Consonant without the prior approval of Holdco (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as required by Law and then only to
the extent necessary, or without providing the other parties the opportunity
to review and comment thereon; _provided_ , _however_ , that Vowel,
in connection with a Change of Vowel Recommendation, may amend or supplement
the Filings (including by incorporation by reference) to effect such a Change
of Vowel Recommendation. Holdco shall advise Consonant and Vowel promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement
has been declared effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order, or the suspension of the qualification of Holdco
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
information relating to the Parties, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the
Parties which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Filings so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, or an event occurs which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Filings, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party and an amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the
SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to Vowels stockholders.
Holdco, Consonant and Vowel shall furnish Lowenstein Sandler PC and/or
McDermott Will and Emery LLP, as applicable, with executed representation
letters in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such counsel to
support opinions by each of Lowenstein Sandler PC and McDermott Will and Emery
LLP addressed to Holdco to be filed as Exhibits 8.1 and 8.2 to the
Registration Statement. 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall prepare and file any other filings required under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other federal or state securities Law relating to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, including without limitation  _Section 5.3(c)_ and _Section 7.1_ (and for avoidance of doubt, subject to termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_), as soon as is reasonably practicable following the date (the " _SEC Effective Date_ ") upon which the Registration Statement becomes effective with the SEC, (i) Vowel shall, regardless of any Change of Vowel Recommendation, take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws to duly 

     ##### 

  

    

call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus for the purpose of obtaining the Vowel Stockholder
Approval (the " _Vowel Meeting_ "), it being understood that Vowel shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed
not more than ten (10) calendar days after the SEC Effective Date, and (ii)
subject to a Change of Vowel Recommendation in accordance with _Section
5.3(c)_, the Vowel Board shall make the Vowel Recommendation (a statement to
such effect shall be contained in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) and Vowel
shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval
of the transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ , the foregoing shall not
prohibit accurate disclosure (and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a
Change of Vowel Recommendation) of factual information regarding
the business, financial condition or results of operations of Consonant or
Vowel or the fact that a Vowel Alternative Proposal has been made, the
identity of the party making such proposal or the material terms of such
proposal (but not in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus), to the extent
Vowels Board, in good faith after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, determines that such information, facts, identity or terms is
required to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Vowel stockholders
under applicable Law and, _provided_ , _further_ , that the Vowel Board may
only make a Change of Vowel Recommendation in accordance with _Section
5.3(c)_. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding _Sections 5.4(a)_ or _(c)_ , if on a date for which the Vowel Meeting is scheduled (the " _Vowel Meeting Original Date_ "), Vowel has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Vowel Common Stock to adopt this Agreement, Vowel shall have the right to postpone or adjourn the Vowel Meeting to a date which shall not be more than 45 days after the Vowel Meeting Original Date. If Vowel continues not to receive proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Vowel Common Stock to adopt this Agreement, Vowel may make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Vowel Meeting as long as the date of the Vowel Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of 45 days from the Vowel Meeting Original Date in reliance on this subsection. In the event that the Vowel Meeting is adjourned or postponed as a result of applicable Law, including the need to supplement the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, any days resulting from such adjournment or postponement shall not be included for purposes of the calculations of numbers of days pursuant to this _Section 5.4_. 

   

 Section 5.5. _Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods, including the Vowel Specified Approvals and the Consonant Specified Approvals, from Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any 

    ##### 

  

    

Governmental Authority, (ii) obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, in no event shall Vowel or any of its
Subsidiaries, or Consonant or any of its Subsidiaries or Holdco be required
to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to
any third party for any consent or approval required for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any contract or
agreement in excess of $500,000. 

   

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall (i) promptly, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof (or such later date as may be mutually agreed in writing by the Parties), file any and all required Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with respect to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in (x) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are required to be obtained from, any third parties or other Governmental Authorities in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely making all such filings and timely seeking to obtain all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals; (iii) supply to any Governmental Authorities as reasonably promptly as practicable any additional information or documents that may be requested pursuant to any Law or by such Governmental Authority; and (iv) take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as may be necessary promptly to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other Person may assert under any Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Mergers so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require any Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to agree to any Action of Divesture. 

   

 (c) Subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Authority and the Confidentiality Agreements, Vowel and Consonant shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by Vowel or Consonant or any of their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Authority with respect to such transactions. Vowel and Consonant shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental Authority. Each of Vowel and Consonant agrees not to participate in any 

    ##### 

  

    

substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the proposed transactions unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
a Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate. 

   

 (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties contained in  _Section 5.5(b)_, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Law, each of Vowel and Consonant shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 5.5(a)-(d)_, to the extent that a Party or its Affiliates has confidential information contained in any filing with or correspondence to a Governmental Authority, such Party shall not be required to share such portion of such filing or correspondence with the other Party. A Party may request entry into a joint defense agreement as a condition to providing any materials to another Party in connection with the matters covered by  _Sections 5.5(a)-(d)_ and, upon receipt of that request, the Parties shall work in good faith to enter into a joint defense agreement to create and preserve attorney-client privilege in a form and in substance mutually acceptable to the Parties. 

   

 Section 5.6. _Takeover Statute_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, if any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby after the date hereof, each of Vowel and Consonant and the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on transactions contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 5.7. _Public Announcements_. Subject to _Section 5.4(a)_ of this Agreement and except in connection with a Change of Vowel Recommendation, Holdco, Vowel and Consonant will consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or other public statement, comment or filing and will obtain the approval of the other, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, prior to the issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment or the making of any filing relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such press release or other public statement or comment, or make any such filing, prior to such consultation and approval except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case the Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Parties in advance of any such press release or 

   ##### 

  

    

other public statement, comment or filing. The executive officers of Holdco,
Consonant and Vowel will cause their respective employees, Representatives
and Subsidiaries to comply with this _Section 5.7_. Holdco, Consonant and
Vowel agree to issue a joint press release announcing this Agreement in form
and substance mutually agreeable to Holdco, Consonant and Vowel. 

  

 Section 5.8. _Indemnification and Insurance._  

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Vowel shall purchase a six-year extended reporting period ("tail") to report claims under its then existing directors and officers (" _D andO_") insurance policies (" _D andO Program_") and its fiduciary liability insurance policies (" _Fiduciary Program_ ") arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission occurring on or prior to the Effective Time (including any which arise out of or relate to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents), all on terms no less favorable than such insurance then maintained in effect by Vowel or its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, in terms of coverage and amount, except that the tail for the DandO Program, at Vowels option, shall provide coverage solely on a Side-A basis (the " _D andO Tail Insurance_"). Further, the excess insurance policies on the DandO Program, at Vowels option, each shall specify that they will drop down to provide coverage in place of any insolvent underlying insurer. After the Effective Time, neither Holdco nor Vowel shall amend, modify, replace or terminate the DandO Tail Insurance or any related policies or agreements that are in effect at or immediately before the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) Holdco shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of Vowel and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether asserted or commenced prior to or after the Effective Time (but only to the extent relating to acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time) (an " _Indemnifiable Claim"_ ), to the full extent permitted under the DGCL and Vowels and its Subsidiaries respective certificates of incorporation and by-laws, in each case as in effect on the date hereof or as expanded subsequent to the Effective Time. Holdco and Consonant acknowledge and accept as contract rights (and agree to cause Holdcos and Consonants Subsidiaries (whether existing as of the date hereof or later formed or acquired, but excluding Consonant Learning and its Subsidiaries) to honor in accordance with their terms) the provisions of Vowels and its Subsidiaries (treating LAZEL as if it were a Subsidiary of Vowel as of the date hereof) respective certificates of incorporation and by-laws as in effect on the date hereof (or, in the case of LAZEL, as of the Closing) with respect to exculpation from liability and indemnification of officers, directors, employees and agents of Vowel and the Subsidiaries (including provisions relating to contributions, advancement of expenses and the like), and agree such rights shall not be modified or amended except as required by Law, unless such modification or amendment expands the rights of the Indemnified Persons to indemnification (including with respect to contribution, advancement of expenses and the like);  _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the above-described contract rights acknowledged and agreed by Holdco and Consonant (and their respective Subsidiaries, other than Consonant Learning and its Subsidiaries) under this _Section 5.8(b)_, and any and all obligations with respect thereto, shall only be applicable to, and shall only include those rights set forth in the respective 

   ##### 

  

   

certificates of incorporation and by-laws (in each case, as in effect on the
date hereof or as of the Effective Time in the case of LAZEL) of, each of
Vowel and any Subsidiary of Vowel that remains in existence and a Subsidiary
of Vowel at the Effective Time. If any Subsidiary of Vowel, other than LAZEL,
is sold to, or merged or consolidated with, any Person other than Holdco or a
Subsidiary thereof then such Subsidiarys obligations under this _Section
5.8(b)_ shall thereupon, automatically without further action or deed, be
extinguished and void _ab initio_ , other than with respect to any
Indemnifiable Claim for which Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries shall have
received written notice prior to the closing of any such sale, merger or
consolidation. Holdco shall advance expenses (including attorneys fees) to
each such Indemnified Person to the full extent permitted by law; _provided_
, _that_ , the Indemnified Person must provide a written undertaking to repay
all expenses if it is finally judicially determined that such Indemnified
Person is not entitled to indemnification. Any Indemnified Person seeking to
claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this _Section
5.8(b)_, upon learning of any Indemnifiable Claim, shall promptly provide
written notice to Holdco specifying in reasonable detail the Indemnifiable
Claim, the basis for such indemnification or advancement of expenses and the
undertaking contemplated by the preceding proviso if advancement of expenses
is desired;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of an Indemnified
Person to give such notice shall only relieve Holdco of its indemnification
or advancement obligation to the extent of actual prejudice resulting
therefrom. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.8(b)_ to
the contrary, Holdcos and its Subsidiaries obligations under this _Section
5.8(b)_ shall terminate with respect to any Indemnifiable Claim for which
Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries shall not have received written notice
prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect
to such Indemnifiable Claim (subject to any tolling agreements). 

   

 Section 5.9. _Employee Relations and Benefits_. 

  

 (a) Holdco shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, make any material modifications, effective during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary thereof, to (i) the base compensation and incentive compensation program as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the Vowel Employees who are active employees of Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " _Vowel Active Employees_ ") or (ii) the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements provided to Vowel Employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless, in case of clauses (i) or (ii) (other than with respect to 2009 incentive compensation payable in 2009 or 2010 pursuant to the plans or arrangements described in _Section 5.9(a)_ of the Vowel Disclosure Schedules (the " _2009 Incentive Plans_ ")), any such modification is applicable to similarly situated employees of Consonant Learning; _provided_ , _however_ , nothing in this _Section 5.9_ shall prevent Holdco or any Subsidiary from making any modification (other than with respect to 2009 Incentive Plans) (x) to the extent required to comply with applicable Law, or (y) that is approved by the Special Majority of the Holdco Board. Neither Vowel nor any of its Subsidiaries shall amend or otherwise modify the 2009 Incentive Plans prior to the Effective Time without the prior written consent of Holdco, and after the Effective Time, none of Holdco, Vowel or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall amend or otherwise modify or terminate the 2009 Incentive Plans without the consent of the Stockholders Representative. During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary thereof, any Vowel Active Employees who are terminated without cause (as reasonably determined by the applicable employer) shall be 

   ##### 

  

   

entitled to a severance amount no less than they would have received as
severance under the Vowel Benefits Plans in effective immediately before the
Effective Time. 

   

 (b) Holdco and Consonant shall, and shall cause Vowel and the Subsidiaries of Holdco to, recognize all service of the Vowel Active Employees (consistent with Vowels service recognition policies) prior to the Closing Date as service in connection with any 401(k) savings plans, welfare benefit plans and employment policies (including any vacation and holiday policies) that are made available following the Closing Date by any of Holdco, Consonant or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates for purposes of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement (but excluding pension plan accruals). 

   

 (c) Following the Closing Date, Holdco and Consonant shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries of Holdco to, waive, or cause their insurance carriers to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Vowel Active Employees under any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) that is made available to Vowel Active Employees following the Closing Date. 

   

 (d) Nothing herein, express or implied, shall confer upon any Vowel Employee or Consonant Employee any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period of any nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.10. _Holdco Stock Options_. At or prior to the Effective Time the Holdco Board shall adopt the Holdco Equity Incentive Plan and within twenty (20) Business Days after the Effective Time, Holdco shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or, including if Form S-8 is not available, other appropriate forms) with respect to the Holdco Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Holdco Equity Incentive Plan. 

  

 Section 5.11. _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement (including without limitation _Section 5.1_) shall give any of Holdco, Consonant or Vowel, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct any other Partys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Holdco, Consonant and Vowel shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over their respective operations and the operations of their respective Subsidiaries. If and to the extent that compliance with any covenant by a Party in _Section 5.1_ of this Agreement would result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in, a violation of any applicable Law relating to antitrust or competition matters, in each case in the reasonable, good faith judgment of the affected Party after consultation with outside counsel, then each of the Parties shall refrain from enforcing any such covenant and shall cooperate in good faith to structure an arrangement that effectuates the purpose of this Agreement without violation of applicable Law. 

  

 Section 5.12. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Vowel shall give prompt notice to Consonant, and Consonant shall give prompt notice to Vowel, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party (or any of its Affiliates) from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby or from 

   ##### 

  

    

any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if
the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to
obtain such consent could be material to Vowel, the Surviving Corporations,
or Consonant (or, following the Effective Time, Holdco); (ii) any
Proceedings commenced or, to such Partys Knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its
Subsidiaries which relate to the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated hereby; (iii) any representation or warranty made by it or Holdco
in this Agreement or any Transaction Document becoming inaccurate or untrue
in any material respect; or (iv) the discovery of any fact or circumstance
that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which, would cause or result in any of the conditions to the
Mergers set forth in _Article VI_ not being satisfied or satisfaction of
those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any provision of
this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 5.12_ shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice; and, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the failure to give prompt notice hereunder pursuant to
clause (iv) shall not constitute a failure of a condition to the Mergers set
forth in _Article VI_ except to the extent that the underlying fact or
circumstance not so notified would standing alone constitute such a failure. 

  

 Section 5.13. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, Vowel will take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause dispositions of Vowel equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of Vowel to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Prior to the Effective Time, Holdco will take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause acquisitions of Holdco equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is or will become a director or officer of Holdco to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 5.14. _Agreement to Defend; Stockholder Litigation_. In the event any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority or other Person is commenced that questions the validity or legality of the Mergers, the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or seeks damages in connection therewith, the Parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to promptly take or cause to be taken all actions necessary, proper or advisable to defend against and respond thereto; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.14_ shall limit the Parties obligations under _Section 5.5_ hereof. Vowel shall give Consonant and Holdco a reasonable opportunity to participate (at Consonants or Holdcos sole expense) in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against Vowel and its directors relating to the Mergers;  _provided_ , that no such settlement shall be agreed to without Holdcos prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such settlement does not create any obligations for Vowel or its Subsidiaries other than the payment of monetary damages not in excess of $2,500,000 and Vowel, its Subsidiaries or other defendants, as applicable, receives a general release in its favor. 

   #####

 Section 5.16. _Directors of Holdco_. As contemplated in the Holdco Stockholders Agreement by and among Holdco, VSS-Consonant Holdings III and the Stockholders Representative attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (the " _Holdco Stockholders Agreement_ ") and on the terms and conditions contained therein, at the Effective Time, the Vowel Designees and the Consonant Designees shall be the directors of Holdco until their successors shall be duly elected and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 (b) From the date hereof through the earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination Date, if a Credit Agreement Default occurs under Section 6.10 of the Senior Credit Agreement or Section 8.3 of the Mezzanine Credit Agreement (each, a " _Financial Default_ ") that may be cured (or, if permitted by the lenders thereunder, waived) under Section 8.04 of the Senior Credit Agreement or Section 9.6 of the Mezzanine Credit Agreement (each, a " _Consonant Equity Cure_ "), then Consonant shall, subject to the limitation in the succeeding proviso, use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such Consonant Equity Cure within the time period permitted to do so under such Section 8.04 and Section 9.6, as applicable, by issuing equity securities (as permitted under the Credit Agreements, as in effect on the date hereof except for such amendments or modifications as are permitted under _Schedule 5.1(b)(xix)_ of the Consonant Disclosure Schedule) or taking such other action (other than the issuance of any debt securities) as is permitted by, and has the effect of curing such Financial Default under, the applicable Credit Agreement (as in effect on the date hereof except for such amendments or modifications as are permitted under _Schedule 5.1(b)(xix)_ of the Consonant Disclosure Schedule);  _provided_ , _that_ , in no event shall Consonant be obligated to effect the Consonant Equity Cure if the amount required to be invested or paid directly to the agent and/or lenders exceeds $3,000,000 (less any 

    ##### 

  

    

Equity Cure Payment Amount funded between the date hereof and the
Effective Time) (the amount funded by Consonant prior to the Effective Time
as described above, the " _Equity Cure Payment Amount_ "); _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , Consonant shall have no obligation to effect the
Consonant Equity Cure if, at the time such Consonant Equity Cure
is consummated (or required to be consummated), a Credit Agreement Default
other than a Financial Default (a " _General Default_ ") does or would then
exist after consummation of the Consonant Equity Cure (a " _General Cure
Failure_ ") or there is any other event or circumstance (related or unrelated
to the Credit Agreements) that gives rise to a failure of any condition in
_Section 6.2_ , unless Vowel has validly and irrevocably waived the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ (relating to each and every then
pending Credit Agreement Default and any other then existing nonCredit
Agreement event or circumstance that gives rise to a failure of any
such condition), it being understood that any such waiver shall not apply
with respect to any General Default or other events or circumstances that are
not in existence, or that were not fully disclosed by Consonant to Vowel, at
the time of the consummation (or required consummation) of the Consonant
Equity Cure. If a General Default occurs under either of the Credit
Agreements, Consonant shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cure
or obtain a waiver of such General Default prior to the expiration of the
Cure Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Consonant be
required to pay any penalties, fees or other amounts to the applicable agent
or lender to cure or obtain a waiver of a General Default; _provided_ ,
_further_ ,  _however_ , the failure to cure or obtain a waiver of a General
Default shall not give rise to the payment of the Consonant Ordinary
Termination Fee, the Consonant Enhanced Termination Fee or Consonant Breach
Termination Fee under this Agreement. 

   

 (c) If (i) a Financial Default occurs, (ii) Consonant becomes obligated to effect the Consonant Equity Cure with respect to such Financial Default under _Section 5.21(b)_, (iii) Consonant fails to do so in accordance with _Section 5.21(b)_, and (iv) all of the conditions in _Section 6.3_ are satisfied as of the date that Consonant becomes obligated to effect such Consonant Equity Cure assuming that the Closing were to occur on such date (other than the conditions contained in _Sections 6.3(e), (f) and (j)_) (the occurrence of such events, an " _Equity Cure Failure_ "), then Vowel may exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(j)_ and shall upon such termination be entitled to receive the Consonant Enhanced Termination Fee. 

   

 (d) If either the Equity Cure Payment Amount or the Consonant Acquired Debt Payment is greater than zero, or any other amount (up to but not exceeding $1,000,000) is paid by any of the Consonant Holders to the agent or lenders under the Credit Agreements after the date hereof through and including the Effective Time, if any, to cure or obtain a waiver of a Credit Agreement Default, then, in consideration of any such payment, at the Effective Time, Holdco shall issue to VSS-Consonant Holdings III, a Holdco Warrant, which shall be exercisable for a number of shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to the quotient (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (x) the aggregate amount paid, _divided by_ (y) the Vowel Per Share Cash Consideration. The Holdco Warrant shall be subject to customary registration rights in favor of the holder thereof and its permitted successors and assigns. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither VSS-Consonant Holdings III nor any of its Affiliates shall receive a Holdco Warrant with respect to: (a) any indebtedness under the Credit Agreements, unless such indebtedness is retired or contributed to Holdco and extinguished on or before the Effective Time; or (b) for the avoidance of doubt, any 

   ##### 

  

   

indebtedness issued after the date hereof by Consonant or VSS-Consonant
Holdings or any Subsidiary thereof, the proceeds of which are used to acquire
any, or which otherwise would be a, Consonant Acquired Debt Payment. 

   

 Section 5.22. _Vowel Tax Holdback Amounts; Tax Refund Escrow_. 

  

 (a) On or prior to the Effective Time, Vowel shall deposit with the Escrow Agent cash in immediately available funds equal to (x) the Vowel Tax Refund Holdback Amount, if any, to be held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, which amount shall be deposited in the "CVR Escrow Account" (as that term is defined in the Escrow Agreement) and (y) unless covered by insurance at the Effective Time, the Vowel Closing Liability identified as number 7 on _Schedule 5.24_, which amount shall be deposited in the "280G Escrow Account" (as that term is defined in the Escrow Agreement). 

   

 (b) Until the sooner of (x) payment in full of all amounts due (or which may become due) under the CVRs (other than the payment of the 280G Returned Amount) in accordance with their terms and (y) the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Holdco shall cause Vowel and its Subsidiaries to, and Vowel and its Subsidiaries shall, deposit any and all Vowel Tax Refunds received by Vowel, any of its Subsidiaries or Holdco (on behalf of Vowel) on or after the Closing Date, promptly after receipt thereof, with the Escrow Agent in the CVR Escrow Account, to be held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Holdco shall cause Vowel and its Subsidiaries to, and Vowel and its Subsidiaries shall, use commercially reasonable efforts to recover such Vowel Tax Refunds during the period specified in the preceding sentence. Any and all funds deposited in the CVR Escrow Account (including interest thereon) shall be applied to the payment of the Contingent Value Rights in accordance with the Contingent Value Right Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , Holdco shall be entitled to obtain the release from the CVR Escrow Account, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, of an amount equal to (x) the portion of Agreed Contingencies for which Vowel is responsible pursuant to _Section 5.23_ and (y) the Vowel Tax Refund Documented Costs. The Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to obtain the release from the CVR Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement of any fees, expenses or charges incurred or paid by the Stockholders Representative as contemplated in _Section 8.2_. 

   

 (c) So long as funds remain in the CVR Escrow Account, Holdco and Vowel shall promptly provide to the Stockholders Representative and the Stockholders Representative shall promptly provide to Holdco and Vowel, all written statements and other correspondence received by such Person or any of such Persons Subsidiaries from the Escrow Agent (or delivered by such Person or any of such Persons Subsidiaries to the Escrow Agent) with respect to activity in the Escrow Account. In addition, Holdco shall deliver to the Stockholders Representative (1) within ten (10) days after receipt by the Escrow Agent, with respect to each calendar quarter while there are funds held in the CVR Escrow Account, a written statement setting forth each of the following: (a) the balance of the CVR Escrow Account as of the opening of business on the first day of such quarter (or on the Closing Date, in the case of the first quarter ended after the Closing Date); (b) any deposits and withdrawals made in the CVR Escrow Account during the quarter and (c) the balance of the CVR Escrow Account as of the last day of the quarter; and (2) within ten (10) days after the end of each calendar quarter while there are 

   ##### 

  

   

funds held under the CVR Escrow Account, a written statement setting forth
each of the following: (a) the status of all unpaid Vowel Tax Refunds listed
on _Section 9.15(ii)_ of the Vowel Disclosure Schedule and (b) whether any
dispute with a Governmental Authority exists with respect to any refund
listed on _Section 9.15(ii)_ of the Vowel Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (d) In order to secure their obligations to direct the Vowel Tax Refunds into the Escrow Account, at the Closing, Holdco and Vowel shall execute and deliver a security agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit J_ hereto (the " _Security Agreement_ "), under which each of Holdco and Vowel grants to the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Vowel Stockholders) a valid security interest in and to the Vowel Tax Refunds and all proceeds thereof with such proceeds to be distributed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, together with such other ancillary agreements, instruments or certificates to be executed by either of them as are reasonably necessary or appropriate to perfect such security interest. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (including the covenants in _Section 5.1_), Vowel may at any time prior to the Closing notify the appropriate taxing authorities and direct payment of the Vowel Tax Refunds to the CVR Escrow Account or to a segregated Vowel account subject to a control agreement or similar arrangement that is mutually acceptable to the Parties, and, until the sooner of (x) payment of all Vowel Tax Refunds to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and (y) the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Holdco hereby agrees that it will cause such payment direction to be continuously effective and will not (and will not permit Vowel to) modify or revoke such payment direction, unless with the express written consent of the Stockholders Representative (which consent may be withheld or granted in its sole discretion). 

   

 Section 5.23.  _Agreed Contingencies_. 

  

 (a) Vowel and Consonant have identified the Agreed Contingencies, and, provided that the Closing shall have occurred, agreed to a financial sharing arrangement with respect to such liabilities as set forth in this _Section 5.23_. If any of the Agreed Contingencies have been paid on or before the Closing Date, no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this _Section 5.23_ with respect to such Agreed Contingencies. If any of the Agreed Contingencies are assessed, levied or become subject to a notice of deficiency before the Closing Date, Vowel shall pay, settle or object to any such Agreed Contingencies in a manner consistent with its past practices. 

   

 (b) After the Closing Date until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, with respect to any Agreed Contingencies that are assessed, levied or become subject to a notice of deficiency, Holdco shall cause Vowel to, and Vowel shall, pay, settle or object to any such Agreed Contingencies in a commercially reasonable manner. 

   

 (c) To the extent any of the Agreed Contingencies are paid by Holdco or its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date and on or before the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, an amount equal to 50% of the aggregate amount by which such Agreed Contingencies (except in the case of the Designated Tax Liability, then an amount not to exceed $1,400,000, and whether paid to a Governmental Authority or to the Designated Person) so paid or which are otherwise due and payable exceeds an aggregate deductible of $250,000 (such 

    ##### 

  

    

$250,000 deductible to be reduced dollar for dollar to the extent such
deductible previously mitigated a reduction of the CVR), shall dollar
for dollar reduce the aggregate amount payable pursuant to the CVRs (but not
below zero) in accordance with the terms thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the case of the Designated Tax Liability, to the extent the
amount paid on or before the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing
Date in respect of the Designated Tax Liability exceeds the sum of $1,400,000
plus the then unused portion of the $250,000 deductible set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence, whether paid to any Governmental Authority or
to the Designated Person, such excess shall dollar for dollar reduce the
aggregate amount payable pursuant to the CVRs (but not below zero) in
accordance with the terms thereof. Holdco shall be entitled to obtain the
release from the CVR Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement of the amount by which the CVR is reduced pursuant to the
two immediately preceding sentences. With respect to each Agreed Contingency
paid on or before the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date and
the corresponding Vowel Shared Tax Offset Amount, Holdco shall, and shall
cause Vowel, and Vowel shall, use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i)
provided that a reduction is not prohibited under applicable Law, negotiate
with the Governmental Authority to whom such Agreed Contingency is due, to
have such Agreed Contingency reduced by such Vowel Shared Tax Offset Amount;
and (ii) to the extent such Agreed Contingency is not so reduced under clause
(i), include such Vowel Shared Tax Offset Amount in a refund claim, Tax
Return or amended Tax Return, as applicable, in each case which shall
be filed as soon as reasonably practicable. On or before the eighteen (18)
month anniversary of the Closing Date, except as provided in the immediately
succeeding sentence, Holdco shall and shall cause Vowel to, and Vowel shall,
promptly deposit into the CVR Escrow Account an amount equal to the product
of (x) the Applicable Refund Percentage multiplied by (y) the cash amount
realized by Vowel, any of its Subsidiaries or Holdco (on behalf of Vowel)
from any Vowel Shared Tax Offset Amounts on or before the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (but only to the extent not previously used
to avoid a reduction in the CVR). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence to the contrary, if any reduction of the CVR under this Agreement
would have reduced the CVR below zero but for the limitations on reducing the
CVR below zero in this Agreement, then any deposit into the CVR Escrow
Account pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be reduced,
dollar for dollar, by the lesser of (x) the amount of such deposit, and (y)
the amount by which the CVR would have been reduced below zero but for the
limitations on such reductions in this Agreement, and this calculation shall
be made on a cumulative basis. 

   

 Section 5.24. _Vowel Closing Liabilities_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Vowel or its Subsidiaries shall (a) pay in cash to the recipients named in the Liability Contracts (as defined below) the Vowel Closing Funding Amount identified in numbers 5, 6, 14, 17 and 24 on  _Schedule 5.24_, (b) retain in cash the Vowel Closing Funding Amount identified in numbers 13, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and, unless insurance is purchased prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Vowel Closing Liability number 31 on Schedule 5.24, (c) fund to the extent not already funded into a rabbi trust(s), the Vowel Closing Funding Amount identified in numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 32 and 33 on _Schedule 5.24_, and (d) fund into the 280G Escrow Fund (as defined in the Escrow Agreement), the Vowel Closing Funding Amount identified as number 7 on _Schedule 5.24_ (unless insurance is purchased prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Vowel Closing Liability), in each case to the extent such Vowel Closing Liability remains a liability of Vowel or its Subsidiaries on such date (it being understood that Vowel or its Subsidiaries may pay such liabilities in cash on or prior to the 

   ##### 

  

    

Effective Time, but only (i) to the extent required to be paid prior to the
Effective Time by the terms of the Contract governing such payment, benefit
or other liabilities, as such Contract is in effect on the date hereof (the "
_Liability Contracts_ ") or (ii) with respect to the Vowel Closing Liability
identified as number 14 on _Schedule 5.24_). Forms of each of the agreements
and other documents establishing each such trust, fund escrow account or
arrangement (the " _Liability Funding Documents_ ") shall be substantially in
the form attached to  _Section 5.24_ of the Vowel Disclosure Schedule.
Following the Effective Time and until each of the respective Vowel Closing
Liabilities is satisfied (whether satisfied by payment, provision of benefit,
expiration of obligation, and/or forfeiture of the right to payment or benefit
in accordance with the applicable Liability Contract), and unless otherwise
required by applicable Law, Holdco shall cause Vowel and Vowels then
Subsidiaries (but only so long as such Subsidiary remains a Subsidiary of
Vowel) to: (i) refrain from pledging or acting to impose (or omitting to take
any action which would have the effect of imposing) any lien, security
interest or encumbrance on, whether directly or indirectly, the assets of
Vowel and the amounts in such rabbi trusts, escrows, or cash set aside for
the future satisfaction of the respective Vowel Closing Liability; (ii) to
the extent the Vowel Closing Funding Amounts are funded by Vowel or its
Subsidiaries in accordance with this _Section 5.24_, make the payments or
refrain from preventing the Escrow Agent or the trustee for the applicable
rabbi trust from making the payments as required to satisfy the respective
Vowel Closing Liability as it comes due as provided for under the
Liability Contracts and subject to the Liability Funding Documents; (iii)
except as required by applicable Law, refrain from amending the terms
governing a Liability Contract without the prior written consent of the
Person or Persons party to such Vowel Closing Liability; (iv) except as
otherwise provided in the last sentence of this _Section 5.24_, not prevent
the Escrow Agent from paying to the CVR Rights Agent, for distribution
pursuant to the CVRs, the amount, if any, that is retained in the CVR Escrow
Account with respect to Vowel Closing Liability identified as number 7 on
_Schedule 5.24_ (the " _280G Returned Amount_ ") on or as of October 15, 2013
or such other time provided in the Escrow Agreement; and (v) not prevent the
trustee of the rabbi trust(s) from paying to the Escrow Agent, for
distribution to the CVR holders pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and the CVR
Agreement, the amount, if any, that remains in the rabbi trust(s)
with respect to each of the Vowel Closing Liabilities identified as numbers
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25 and 33 after the respective Vowel
Closing Liability is satisfied (collectively, the " _Excess Employee Payment
Amounts_ "); and (vi) with respect to the Vowel Closing
Liabilities identified as numbers 28, 29, 30, and 31 for which insurance has
not been purchased, provide the same or substantially equivalent health
benefits coverage as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, for the
duration specified in the Liability Contract governing each such
Vowel Closing Liability, at the same cost to the former employee as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date, provided that to the extent Holdco,
Vowel and Vowels Subsidiaries provide the benefits contemplated under this
clause (vi), they may reduce the amounts set aside for such Vowel Closing
Liability pro rata in equal installments, on a monthly basis, over the
applicable period during which the applicable benefit is provided.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any provision of any Liability Contract or
Liability Funding Document to the contrary, to the extent any amount remains
in the rabbi trust(s) with respect to any of the Vowel Closing Liabilities
identified as numbers 15, 16, 18 or 19 after satisfaction in full of such
liabilities, the trustee of the rabbi trust(s) shall promptly return such
amount to Holdco. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or in the Escrow
Agreement to the contrary, if the 280G Excess Amount is greater than zero,
then, the 280G Returned Amount shall be reduced by such 280G Excess Amount
and such 280G Excess 

   ##### 

  

    

Amount shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to Holdco instead of the CVR Rights
Agent, concurrent with the payment of the remaining portion 280G Returned
Amount to the CVR Rights Agent. Following the Effective Time and until each
of the respective Vowel Closing Liabilities is satisfied (whether satisfied
by payment, provision of benefit, expiration of obligation, and/or forfeiture
of the right to payment or benefit in accordance with the applicable
Liability Contract), Holdco shall guarantee, pursuant to a guaranty in the
form of _Exhibit R_ hereto (the " _Holdco Vowel Liability Guaranty_ "), the
satisfaction in full of each Vowel Closing Liability identified as numbers
1, 2, 26, 27, 29, 30, and 31 on _Schedule 5.24_ (provided that, with respect
to each such liability, if the dollar amount set forth on _Schedule 5.24_ in
respect of such liability is not funded in full on or before the Effective
Time in accordance with this _Section 5.24_, then the Holdco Vowel Liability
Guaranty with respect to such liability (and only such liability) shall be
limited to the amount so funded and such guaranteed obligations shall be
reduced dollar for dollar to the extent such liability is paid to its
intended recipient from the amounts funded prior to or at the Effective Time
pursuant to this _Section 5.24_ as set forth on  _Schedule 5.24_). 

  

 Section 5.25. _LAZEL Spinoff_. 

  

 (a) To be effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, Vowel shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, effect the transfer of the businesses described as LearningA-Z.com and ExploreLearning from Vowel Expanded Learning to LAZEL (the " _LAZEL Spinoff Transaction_ ") pursuant to the LAZEL Spinoff Documents. Vowel shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, perform their respective obligations under the LAZEL Spinoff Documents. Unless this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with its terms, Vowel shall not, and shall not cause or permit any of its Subsidiaries to: (x) terminate, amend or in any way modify any of the LAZEL Spinoff Documents or any provisions therein; or (y) except as expressly contemplated in this Agreement (including without limitation _Section 5.1_ or any corresponding schedule), enter into any Contract which has the effect of impeding, delaying or diminishing in any material respect the practical benefits to Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries of, the LAZEL Spinoff Transaction, unless, in the case of (x) or (y), Holdco shall have consented in writing prior thereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

   

 (b) After the Effective Time and the consummation of the LAZEL Spinoff Transaction, other than sales of inventory and services in the ordinary course of business, none of the equity interests, material assets, rights or material properties of LAZEL shall be transferred, sold, assigned, pledged, or disposed of, whether directly or indirectly, with or without consideration, or in any transaction or series of transactions, to Holdco or any Subsidiary of Holdco (such transaction being referred to as the " _LAZEL Drop-Down Transaction_ "), unless and until all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) Holdco determines in its reasonable good faith judgment that the LAZEL Drop-Down Transaction complies with the Credit Agreements (and any ancillary documents thereto) or the requisite lenders under the applicable Credit Agreements have consented to the LAZEL Drop-Down Transaction, (ii) all Vowel Transaction Expenses (including, without duplication, the Vowel Expense Reimbursement Amount) have been paid in full, (iii) Holdco shall have received a solvency opinion from a reputable valuation firm in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Special Majority of the Holdco Board,

and (iv) Holdco shall provide an unconditional guaranty of payment (not
collection) with respect to the remaining Vowel Closing Liabilities. 

   

 (c) Prior to the LAZEL Drop-Down Transaction, LAZEL shall provide an unconditional guaranty of payment (not collection), in the form of _Exhibit K_ attached hereto (the " _LAZEL Guaranty_ "), of the Vowel Tax Refunds to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, provided that such guaranty shall terminate automatically upon the consummation of the LAZEL Drop-Down Transaction, provided that all of the conditions precedent to the LAZEL Drop-Down Transaction set forth in _clauses (i) through (iv)_ of _Section 5.25(b)_ have been satisfied.

 Section 5.27. _Working Capital_. 

  

 (a) Except as expressly contemplated or permitted by, or disclosed pursuant to, this Agreement, Vowel shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, during the period beginning on the date hereof through the Effective Time, manage working capital in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, in order to maintain a level of working capital consistent with past practice, including without limitation: (i) purchasing inventory at times and in amounts consistent with past practices; (ii) paying accounts payable in amounts and within time periods in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices; (iii) not discounting sales, except to the extent doing so would be in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (iv) failing to make investments or capital expenditures in accordance with the capital expenditure budget set forth in _Section 5.1(b)(x)_ of the Vowel Disclosure Schedule, except to the extent doing so would be consistent with past practice, and (v) not accelerating collection of accounts receivable or discounting accounts receivable, except to the extent consistent with past practice. 

   

 (b) Holdco has the right, for a period of thirty (30) calendar days after the Closing Date, to assert a breach by Vowel of any obligation in _Section 5.27(a)_ by delivery of written notice (the " _Working Capital Dispute Notice_ ") to the Stockholders Representative setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of the alleged breach and the amount by which the CVR should be reduced in accordance with the formula set forth in _Section 5.27(d)_ (a " _Working Capital Dispute_ "). The failure to timely deliver a Working Capital Dispute notice in accordance with the preceding sentence shall constitute a waiver of any dispute rights under this _Section 5.27_. If Holdco delivers a timely Working Capital Dispute Notice to the Stockholders Representative, Holdco and the Stockholders Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the Working Capital Dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations within (10) Business Days after Holdcos delivery of its Working Capital Dispute Notice, then Holdco and the Stockholders Representative shall jointly engage the Independent Accountant to resolve such Working Capital Dispute. To the extent Holdco and the Stockholders Representative resolve any portion of such Working Capital Dispute, they shall jointly deliver a written notice of such resolution to the Escrow Agent, who shall disburse to Holdco the amount set forth therein. 

   

 (c) The Independent Accountant may, at its discretion, conduct a conference concerning the Working Capital Dispute, at which conference Holdco and the Stockholders Representative shall have the right to present additional documents, materials and other information and to have present their respective advisors, experts, counsel and accountants. In connection with the resolution of the Working Capital Dispute, there shall be no other hearings or oral examinations, testimony, depositions, discovery or other similar proceedings, unless the Independent Accountant shall so determine. Holdco shall make available to the Stockholders Representative and the Independent Accountant such documents, books, records, work papers, facilities, personnel and other information as the Stockholders Representative or the Independent Accountant may reasonably request to resolve the Working Capital Dispute. The Independent Accountant shall as promptly as possible, and in any event within thirty (30) days after the date of its appointment, render its decision on the dispute in writing to Holdco and the Stockholders Representative and shall set forth the amount of any adjustment to the CVR, if any, pursuant to  _Section 5.27(d)_ as is reflected in its decision (the " _Working Capital Award_ "). The Independent Accountant (i) shall be bound to follow the provisions of this Agreement, 

    ##### 

  

    

(ii) may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
claimed for such item or less than the smallest value claimed for such item
by the Stockholders Representative or Holdco, as the case may be, (iii)
shall limit its decision to such items as are in dispute, (iv) shall only have
the power to determine (A) whether a breach of _Section 5.27(a)_ has
occurred and whether and the extent to which such breach increased or
decreased the Available Vowel Cash for Cash Election, and (B) whether any
change in the CVR should be made under _Section 5.27(d)_ as a result of
such breach, but in each case, the Independent Accountants determination
must be in accordance with GAAP, (v) shall determine the party entitled to an
award of fees and expenses pursuant to  _Section 5.27(e)_ and shall set
forth such determination in the Working Capital Award, and (vi) shall not be
deemed an arbitrator but only an independent party retained by the Parties
for the purpose of making accounting and mathematical determinations in
accordance with this Agreement. The determination of the Independent
Accountant in accordance with this _Section 5.27_ shall be final and binding
upon the parties. 

   

 (d) If the Independent Accountant determines, in accordance with the procedures set forth in  _Section 5.27(c),_ that a breach of _Section 5.27(a)_ has occurred, then the aggregate amount payable under the CVR shall be reduced, dollar for dollar, by the amount, if any, by which (i) the increase in the Available Vowel Cash for Cash Election directly resulting from such breach, exceeds (ii) $400,000. 

   

 (e) If the Independent Accountant determines that the Stockholders Representative is the substantially prevailing party in any dispute determined in accordance with this _Section 5.27_ , then Holdco shall pay the reasonable documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the Stockholders Representative incurred in such dispute (including without limitation the fees and expenses of its representatives, agents, attorneys and accountants), as well as the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant. If the Independent Accountant determines that Holdco is the substantially prevailing party in any dispute determined in accordance with this _Section 5.27_ , then, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any amounts to be deposited with the Escrow Agent by Holdco or any Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement after such Independent Accountants determination shall be reduced, and Holdco shall be permitted (or such Subsidiary shall be permitted to distribute to Holdco) to retain for its own account, dollar for dollar, an amount equal to the reasonable documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of Holdco incurred in such dispute (including without limitation the fees and expenses of its representatives, agents, attorneys and accountants), as well as the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant. If the Independent Accountant determines that neither party is the substantially prevailing party, then each party shall pay its own out-of-pocket fees and expense incurred in such dispute and one-half of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant.

 (h) by Consonant, upon written notice to the other Parties, if, (A) whether or not permitted to do so, the Vowel Board or any committee thereof shall have withdrawn or modified (in a manner adverse to Consonant) its Vowel Recommendation, or approved or recommended any Vowel Alternative Proposal or Vowel Superior Proposal, (B) Vowel shall have failed to include in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement the Vowel Recommendation, (C) a tender or exchange offer relating to the Vowel Common Stock has been commenced and Vowel fails to send to its security holders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, a statement disclosing that Vowels Board recommends the rejection of such tender or exchange offer, (D) a Vowel Alternative Proposal or Vowel Superior Proposal is publicly announced, and Vowel fails to issue, within ten (10) Business Days after such Vowel Alternative Proposal or Vowel Superior Proposal is announced, a press release that reaffirms the Vowel Recommendation that the stockholders of Vowel vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, (E) the Vowel Board or any committee thereof fails to reject a Vowel Alternative Proposal and deliver written notice thereof to the other Parties, in each case, within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt thereof or shall have approved or publicly recommended a Vowel Alternative Proposal, (F) Vowel shall have entered into any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement, contract or commitment (except for a confidentiality agreement referred to in  _Section 5.3(b)_ entered into in the circumstances referred to in _Section 5.3(b)_) accepting any Vowel Superior Proposal or (G) Vowel is in material breach of any of its obligations set forth in _Section 5.3_, _Section 5.4(a)_, _Section 5.4(c)_, or _Section 5.19_ ; 

  

 (i) by (A) Vowel, upon written notice to the other Parties, if the Closing has not occurred within eleven (11) Business Days following the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ (other than those conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date or Effective Time, as applicable, but which conditions would be satisfied if the Closing Date or Effective Time, as applicable, were the date of such notice), including, without limitation, due to the failure of Holdco to fund to the Exchange Agent either $25,000,000 pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_, the Vowel Expense Reimbursement Amount pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_, or to pay the Vowel Transaction Expenses (excluding the Vowel Expense Reimbursement Amount) pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Vowel may not exercise such right of termination until the earlier to occur of (i) 

   ##### 

  

    

the Outside Date and (ii) the date that Vowel provided written notice
to Consonant that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section
6.2_ are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions set forth in
_Section 6.2(f)_, _Section 6.2(g)_ and _Section 6.2(h)_) or (B) Consonant,
upon written notice to the other Parties, if, whether or not the conditions
set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ have been satisfied or waived,
Consonant elects to terminate this Agreement prior to the Effective
Time other than pursuant to _Sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b), 7.1(c), 7.1(d),
7.1(g), 7.1(h) or 7.1(k)_; 

  

 (j) by Vowel, upon written notice to the other Parties, if Vowel is entitled to terminate this Agreement under _Section 5.21(c)_; 

  

 (k) by Consonant, upon written notice to the other Parties, if the number of Vowel Dissenting Shares is equal to or exceeds 7.5000% of the total number of shares of Vowel Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time; or 

  

 (l) by Vowel, upon written notice to the other Parties, if, on the Closing Date, the Holdings III Merger Transactions shall not have been consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.2. _Effect of Termination; Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall immediately become null and void and have no further effect and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Parties or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, except that the provisions of _Section 5.2(b)_, _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.3_, and _Article IX_ will survive the termination hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event of a termination solely pursuant to _Sections 7.1(e)_ or _Section 7.1(g)_: (x) no such termination shall relieve any Party from liability for fraud; and (y) in the event that such termination results from (I) any "material and willful" breach of any representations and warranties contained in _Article III or IV_ made and measured only as of the date hereof or (II) the failure by such Party to perform its material covenants or obligations hereunder, the Party committing such breach or failure to perform shall be liable for damages resulting from such breach or failure to perform but only to the extent permitted in this _Section 7.2_. The aggregate liability of Vowel, on the one hand, or Consonant and Holdco, on the other hand, for any "material and willful" breaches of representations or warranties made (and measured only) as of the date hereof, shall be based on actual damages suffered and shall not exceed, in the aggregate, $4,500,000 minus the amount which Vowel, on the one hand, or Consonant and Holdco, on the other hand, are obligated to pay pursuant to _Section 7.3._ If this Agreement is terminated by Vowel pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ as a result of a failure by Holdco and/or Consonant (or any of their respective Affiliates) to perform material covenants or obligations to be performed at or prior to the Effective Time, except for any of the covenants or obligations to be performed under _Section 5.21_, then Consonant shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Vowel a fee of $4,500,000 (less any amounts to be paid by Consonant pursuant to _Section 7.3_) (the " _Consonant Breach Termination Fee_ "). The Consonant Breach Termination Fee shall be paid by Consonant to Vowel in immediately available funds (to an account designated by Vowel) promptly upon termination of this Agreement by Vowel pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_. If this Agreement is terminated by Consonant pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ as a result of a failure by Vowel (or any of its Affiliates) to perform material covenants or obligations to be performed at or prior to the Effective Time, then 

   ##### 

  

    

Vowel shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Consonant a fee of $4,500,000
(less any amounts to be paid by Vowel pursuant to _Section 7.3_) (the "
_Vowel Breach Termination Fee_ "). The Vowel Breach Termination Fee shall be
paid by Vowel to Consonant in immediately available funds (to an account
designated by Consonant) promptly upon termination of this Agreement by
Consonant pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that (A) the limitations contained herein with respect to covenants to be
performed at or prior to Closing (" _Pre-Closing Covenants_ ") shall not
apply to any Post-Closing Covenants; (B) the limitations contained in this
_Section 7.2_ shall not be interpreted such that Consonant and Holdco become
liable under this _Section 7.2_ for more than an aggregate of $4,500,000
(and not a combined total of $9,000,000), and (C) the limitations set forth
in this _Section 7.2_ shall in no respect limit the right of Holdco and/or
Consonant to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.9_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
damages for failure to perform material covenants and obligations to be
performed prior to Closing resulting in a termination of this Agreement under
_Section 7.1(e)_ or  _Section 7.1(g)_ (the " _Pre-Closing Liabilities_ ")
are impractical to predict or forecast and the amount of the Consonant Breach
Termination Fee and Vowel Breach Termination Fee represent a freely bargained
for and reasonable estimate of such damages. The Parties agree that this
_Section 7.2_ and the payments contemplated thereby are an integral part of
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby and constitute
liquidated damages and not a penalty for failure to perform material
covenants and obligations to be performed prior to Closing resulting in a
termination of this Agreement under _Section 7.1(e)_ or _Section 7.1(g)_ ,
as applicable. For purposes of this Agreement, a "material and willful" breach
shall mean, with respect to a representation or warranty set forth in
_Article III or IV_, such representation or warranty was not, to the
Knowledge of such Party, true and correct in all material respects when made
as of the date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, if any representation or
warranty was true and correct in all material respects when made on the
date hereof, but at any time thereafter, whether or not to such Partys
Knowledge, ceased to be true and correct, such failure to thereafter be or
remain true and correct shall not give rise to a "material and willful"
breach. For avoidance of doubt, the failure of Consonant to cure any
Credit Agreement Default, shall not give rise to damages under this _Section
7.2_. It is understood and agreed that the remedies and liquidated damages
provided in this _Article VII_,  _Section 9.9_ and/or the VSS Limited
Guarantee, as the case may be, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any
act or omission resulting in or from the termination of this Agreement
or other claim (regardless of whether accompanied by termination of this
Agreement) arising out of any representation or warranty in _Article III or
IV_ of this Agreement or any covenant or obligation to be performed or
satisfied at or prior to the Closing, and, except for such remedies and
liquidated damages, no Party shall have, and each Party does hereby knowingly,
intentionally, voluntarily and irrevocably waive, any other claim or right of
recovery against any other Person with respect to such provisions of this
Agreement. Holdco and Consonant acknowledge and agree that they shall not be
entitled to assert any defense to the enforcement of any of their
respective representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement that
are made with respect to, or to be performed by the Subsidiaries (as defined
herein) of Consonant on the grounds that Consonant does not own or control
such Subsidiaries as of the date hereof and/or that the Holdings III Merger
Transactions have not yet occurred as of the date hereof.

 Section 7.3. _Expenses and Other Payments_. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth in this _Section 7.3_, (i) if the Mergers are not consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Mergers, this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the Party incurring or required to incur such expenses and (ii) if the Mergers are consummated, then all Vowel Transaction Expenses and Consonant Transaction Expenses incurred in connection with the Mergers, this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including without limitation the premiums and commissions for the DandO Tail Insurance), other than the Vowel Expense Reimbursement Amount deposited with the Exchange Agent in accordance with _Section 2.3_, shall be paid in full by Vowel (but only to the extent of Vowel Excess Cash, if any) and Holdco (to the extent such Vowel Transaction Expenses and Consonant Transaction Expenses are in excess of Vowel Excess Cash) on the Closing Date to the appropriate vendors or other parties to whom such expenses are owed by wire transfer of immediately available funds;  _provided_ , _however_ , all fees paid (x) in respect of any HSR Act or other regulatory filing and (y) to ghSmart and Company, Inc., shall be borne equally by Vowel and Consonant prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (express or implied), in no event shall the Available Vowel Cash for Cash Election, Available Cash for Tax Refund Consideration or any other amounts to be paid to Vowel Stockholders hereunder (whether before or after Closing) or to be applied to the Vowel Closing Liabilities be reduced by the amount of any Vowel Transaction Expenses (except with respect to any amount in excess of the DandO Maximum Amount) or Consonant Transaction Expenses, but, if Vowel Excess Cash is greater than zero, Vowel shall contribute to the Closing Date payment of Vowel Transaction Expenses an amount in cash equal to the lesser of (x) Vowel Excess Cash, and (y) Vowel Transaction Expenses. The Parties hereto agree that the Consonant Transaction Expenses may be paid by Holdco or its Subsidiaries at or after the Effective Time (subject to the restrictions set forth in the definition of Consonant Transaction Expenses in _Section 4.32_), but no such Consonant Transaction Expenses shall be paid by Holdco, Consonant or any of its Subsidiaries unless and until all Vowel Transaction Expenses are paid in full in cash. 

  

 (b) Vowel shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Consonant a fee equal to Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) (the " _Vowel Termination Fee_ "), less any amounts paid pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_ below, if: (1)(x) this Agreement is terminated by Consonant or Vowel pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ (or if this Agreement is terminable pursuant to  _Section 7.1(d)_ and Vowel terminates this Agreement for another reason other than pursuant to _Section 7.1(e) _or _Section 7.1(j))_, (y) at any time after the date hereof a Vowel Alternative Proposal or a Vowel Superior Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the Vowel Board and (z) within twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement by any Party, Vowel enters into a definitive agreement with any third party with respect to a Vowel Alternative Proposal or a Vowel Superior Proposal, or any such transaction is consummated; (2) this Agreement is terminated by Consonant pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_, provided that Consonant has terminated the Agreement within seven (7) Business Days after receipt of written notice from Vowel that any of the events set forth in _Section 7.1(h)_ have occurred; or (3) this Agreement is terminated by Vowel pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_. Any Vowel Termination Fee shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by Consonant and: (A) if paid pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)(1)_ within two (2) Business 

   ##### 

  

    

Days of Vowel entering into a definitive agreement with a third party with
respect to a Vowel Alternative Proposal or a Vowel Superior Proposal, or the
consummation of any such transaction; (B) if paid pursuant to _Section
7.3(b)(2)_, within two (2) Business Days following termination of this
Agreement by Consonant; or (C) if paid pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)(3)_ prior
to or concurrently with the termination of this Agreement by Vowel. 

  

 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ (or if this Agreement is terminable pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ and Vowel terminates this Agreement for another reason other than pursuant to _Sections 7.1(e) _or _Section 7.1(j))_ under circumstances in which no Vowel Termination Fee is then payable upon such termination (regardless if it subsequently becomes payable under _Section 7.3(b)(1)_), then Vowel shall promptly, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after being notified of such by Consonant, pay all of the reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Consonant in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, up to a maximum of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000), by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by Consonant (the " _Consonant Expense Reimbursement Amount_ "). In the event that a Vowel Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)(1)_ after the payment of the Consonant Expense Reimbursement Amount, the Vowel Termination Fee Amount then payable shall be reduced by the amount of the Consonant Expense Reimbursement Amount so paid. By way of example, in the event Vowel shall have paid to Consonant a Consonant Expense Reimbursement Amount of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) any Vowel Termination Fee Amount thereafter payable shall be equal to Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,500,000). For avoidance of doubt, no Consonant Expense Reimbursement Amount shall be payable if the Vowel Termination Fee has bee paid pursuant to  _Section 7.3(b)(2)_ or _Section 7.3(b)(3_) or the Vowel Breach Termination Fee has been paid pursuant to _Section 7.2._ 

  

 (d) Consonant shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Vowel: (i) a fee equal to Four Million Five Hundred Dollars ($4,500,000) (the " _Consonant Ordinary Termination Fee_ "), if this Agreement is terminated by Vowel or Consonant pursuant to _Sections 7.1(i)_; (ii) the Consonant Ordinary Termination Fee if this Agreement is terminated by Vowel pursuant to _Section 7.1(l)_ , unless the Agreement may then be terminated under _Section 7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.1(k)_ ; or (iii) a fee equal to Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) (the " _Consonant Enhanced Termination Fee_ "), if this Agreement is terminated by Vowel pursuant to _Section 7.1(j)_ in the event of an Equity Cure Failure. In the event this Agreement is terminated by Vowel pursuant to _Section 7.1(j)_ or _Section 7.1(e)_ in the event of a General Cure Failure which has not been waived by Vowel as contemplated in _Section 5.21(b)_, Vowel shall not be entitled to receive any Consonant Termination Fee. Any Consonant Termination Fee shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by Vowel within two (2) Business Days following any termination of this Agreement by Vowel or Consonant in circumstances set forth in this _Section 7.3(d)_. For avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall Consonant be required to pay to Vowel more than one of the following: the Consonant Ordinary Termination Fee, the Consonant Enhanced Termination Fee or the Consonant Breach Termination Fee. 

  

 (e) The Parties agree that this _Section 7.3_ and the payments contemplated thereby are an integral part of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_

 _7.3(e)_ , following the receipt by Consonant of the Vowel Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_, Vowel shall have no further liability with

each case as applicable pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 7.3_ or
any other amount pursuant to this  _Article VII_, shall continue

Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
_Section 7.2_ or this _Section 7.3_, if Vowel fails to pay promptly to
Consonant the Vowel Breach Termination Fee if due and owing under _Section
7.2_ or any amounts due and owing by Vowel under _Section 7.3(b)_ and
_Section 7.3(c)_, in addition to such amounts, Vowel shall pay Consonants
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented legal fees and expenses) in connection with any
action, including the filing of any lawsuit or legal action, taken to collect
payment, together with interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts from
the date such amounts were required to be paid at the prime lending rate
as reported in the _Wall Street Journal_ , plus 2%, on the date such amounts
were required to be paid,  _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall Vowels
liability pursuant to this sentence with respect to the payment of
Consonants out-of-pocket costs, expenses and interest on the amount of any
such unpaid amounts exceed $625,000 in the aggregate. Without limiting the
foregoing provisions of _Section 7.2_, the obligations of Consonant to pay
any Consonant Termination Fee pursuant to the provisions of this _Section
7.3_ or any other amount pursuant to this  _Article VII_ shall continue
notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement or the occurrence of the
Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
_Section 7.2_ or this _Section 7.3_, if Consonant fails to pay promptly to
Vowel the Consonant Breach Termination Fee if due and owing under _Section
7.2_ or any amounts due and owing by Consonant under _Section 7.3(d)_, in
addition to such amounts, Consonant shall pay Vowels reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action, including
the filing of any lawsuit or legal action, taken to collect payment, together
with interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts from the date such
amounts were required to be paid at the prime lending rate as reported in the
_Wall Street Journal_ , plus 2%, on the date such amounts were required to be
paid,  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Consonants liability
pursuant to this sentence with respect to the payment of Vowels out-of-
pocket costs, expenses and interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts
exceed $625,000 in the aggregate.

 Section 9.4. _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.5. _Severability_. If any term or other provision (or portion thereof) of this Agreement, or the application of any such term or other provision (or portion thereof) to any Person, is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (and such determination has become non-appealable) to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any applicable Law, or public policy, such circumstances shall not have the effect of rendering such term or provision in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in any other case or circumstance, or of rendering any other term or provision herein contained invalid, inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever. Upon such final determination, to the extent not reformed by such court, that any term or other provision (or portion thereof) of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

 Section 9.6. _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Consonant and/or Holdco may assign this Agreement to a wholly owned Subsidiary without the prior written consent of any other Party so long as Consonant or Holdco, as the case may be, remains bound as a Party hereto notwithstanding such assignment. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns; _provided_ ,  _further_ , _however_ , upon prior written notice thereof to Vowel, Consonant may assign its rights to any payment under _Article VII_ of this Agreement to any of its Affiliates without the prior written consent of any other Party, and Vowel shall remit such payments, if any, to such Affiliate instead of Consonant as and when due. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 9.7. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules hereto) taken together with the other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreements constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, representations and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and, except for the provisions of  _Section 5.8_ (which, from and after the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons) and Article VIII (which, from and after the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of the Stockholders Representative), nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the Parties) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, including without limitation _Section 5.9_ and _Section 5.24_ hereof, shall confer upon any current or former employee of Vowel or any of its Subsidiaries or any legal representative thereof any rights or remedies of any kind or nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement (including any right to employment, continued employment with any of the Parties or benefits for any specified period). 

  

 Section 9.8. _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Parties, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Vowel Stockholder Approval or adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Consonant but prior to the Effective Time, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law require further approval of the stockholders of Vowel or Consonant, as applicable, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the stockholders of Vowel or Consonant, as applicable. After the Effective Time, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Holdco and the Stockholders Representative, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. 

  

 Section 9.9. _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Specific Performance_. No failure or delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in any Transaction Document, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. Vowel agrees that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by it in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by Vowel or its Subsidiaries. Vowel accordingly agrees that Holdco and/or Consonant shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Vowel and its Subsidiaries and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or in a federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware, without bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Vowel and its Subsidiaries acknowledge that neither Vowel nor its Subsidiaries is entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Consonant and/or Holdco or to enforce specifically the terms of this Agreement and that Vowel and its Subsidiaries sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall be the remedies set forth in _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.3(d)_ (and the VSS __ Limited Guarantee); provided, that if and only if the Mergers are consummated and the Effective 

   ##### 

  

    

Time occurs, the Parties agree (i) that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any Post-Closing Obligations are not performed by such parties in
accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached by such
parties and (ii) that the Stockholders Representative, acting on behalf of
the holders of Vowel Common Stock, shall be entitled, after the Effective
Time, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent a breach or failure to
perform any Post-Closing Obligations by Consonant, Holdco, Vowel or its
Subsidiaries and, after the Effective Time, to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of such Post-Closing Obligations in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or in a federal court sitting in
Wilmington, Delaware, without bond or other security being required, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity. For the avoidance of doubt, Vowel shall not have the right
to specific performance or any injunctions if the Mergers are not
consummated. 

  

 Section 9.10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts to be wholly performed within such State. 

  

 Section 9.11. _Jurisdiction, Etc._

 (b) Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any Proceeding, directly or indirectly, arising out of, or relating to, the Transaction Documents or any of the transactions contemplated thereby (whether based on contract, tort or any other theory) or any counterclaim related thereto in such state or federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such Proceeding in such court. 

  

 (c) Each Party further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such partys address set forth in _Section 9.3_ shall be effective service of process for any Proceeding with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction in this _Section 9.11_ or otherwise. As an alternative method of service, each such party also irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any manner permitted by or under the laws of the State of Delaware. 

  

 Section 9.12. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT 

   ##### 

  

    

IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, ANY
TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY (WHETHER

ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
