accordance with GAAP.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3.23. <U>No Prebillings or Prepayments</U>. Except for existing subscription
products sold in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, neither Vowel nor
any Subsidiary of Vowel has billed or will bill, and Vowel has not received any payments (in the
form of retainers or otherwise) from, any of its customers or potential customers for services to
be rendered or for expenses to be incurred subsequent to the Closing Date, other than any
Multi-Year Contracts. To the extent that accounts receivable include pre-billed amounts, the
corresponding Liabilities have been accrued on Vowel&#146;s books in accordance with GAAP.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3.24. <U>Inventory</U>. The inventories (net of returns and allowances) shown on the
Vowel Financial Statements as of the Balance Sheet Date or thereafter acquired by Vowel or its
Subsidiaries consist of items of a quantity and quality usable or saleable in the ordinary course
of business. Since the Balance Sheet Date, Vowel and its Subsidiaries have continued to replenish
inventories in a normal and customary manner consistent with past practices. Neither Vowel nor its
Subsidiaries has received written or oral notice that it will experience in the foreseeable future
any difficulty in obtaining, in the desired quantity and quality and at a reasonable price and upon
reasonable terms and conditions, the raw materials, supplies or component products required for the
manufacture, assembly or production of its products. The values (net of returns and allowances) at
which inventories are carried reflect the inventory valuation policy of Vowel and its Subsidiaries,
which is in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. Since the Balance Sheet Date, due
provision has been made on the books of Vowel and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices to provide for all slow-moving, obsolete, or
unusable inventories
and such inventory reserves as of the Balance Sheet Date are adequate to provide for such
slow-moving, obsolete or unusable inventory shrinkage.

Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Consonant, threatened that are reasonably likely to
prohibit or restrain the ability of Consonant and its Subsidiaries to perform their obligations
under the Transaction Documents or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. To
the Knowledge of Consonant, there are no facts or circumstances which, if known by a potential

or notice from any Governmental Authority that alleges that Consonant or any Subsidiary of
Consonant is not in compliance in any material respect with any material Law or Permits. Since
January&nbsp;1, 2006, no claims have been asserted or, to the Knowledge of Consonant, threatened in
writing against Consonant or any Subsidiary of Consonant, alleging a violation of any Person&#146;s

or rule, policy, or procedure related to privacy, data protection, or the collection and use of

upward adjustment in premiums under any such insurance policies or which could reasonably be
expected to result in a material prospective upward adjustment in such premiums. Excluding
insurance policies that have expired and been replaced in the ordinary course of business, no
insurance policy has been canceled within the last two years and, to the Knowledge of Consonant, no
threat has been made to cancel any insurance policy of any of Consonant or any Subsidiary of
Consonant during such period. No event has occurred, including, without limitation, the failure by

consistent with past practices; (ii)&nbsp;paying accounts payable in amounts and within time periods in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices; (iii)&nbsp;not discounting sales, except

(the &#147;<U>Working Capital Dispute Notice</U>&#148;) to the Stockholders&#146; Representative setting forth in
reasonable detail the nature of the alleged breach and the amount by which the CVR should be
reduced in accordance with the formula set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;5.27(d)</U> (a &#147;<U>Working Capital
Dispute</U>&#148;). The failure to timely deliver a Working Capital Dispute notice in accordance with
the preceding sentence shall constitute a waiver of any dispute rights under this <U>Section
5.27</U>. If Holdco delivers a timely Working Capital Dispute Notice to the Stockholders&#146;

the Working Capital Dispute, there shall be no other hearings or oral examinations, testimony,

Representative and the Independent Accountant such documents, books, records, work papers,
facilities, personnel and other information as the Stockholders&#146; Representative or the Independent
Accountant may reasonably request to resolve the Working Capital Dispute. The Independent
Accountant shall as promptly as possible, and in any event within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the date
of its appointment, render its decision on the dispute in writing to Holdco and the Stockholders&#146;
Representative and shall set forth the amount of any adjustment to the CVR, if any, pursuant to

<U>Section&nbsp;7.1(g)</U> (the &#147;<U>Pre-Closing Liabilities</U>&#148;) are impractical to predict or

represent a freely bargained for and reasonable estimate of such damages. The Parties agree that
this <U>Section&nbsp;7.2</U> and the payments contemplated thereby are an integral part of the Mergers

representation or warranty was not, to the Knowledge of such Party, true and correct in all

representation or warranty was true and correct in all material respects when made on the date
hereof, but at any time thereafter, whether or not to such Party&#146;s Knowledge, ceased to be true and
correct, such failure to thereafter be or remain true and correct shall not give rise to a

and agreed that the remedies and liquidated damages provided in this <U>Article&nbsp;VII</U>,
<U>Section&nbsp;9.9</U> and/or the VSS Limited Guarantee, as the case may be, shall be the sole and
