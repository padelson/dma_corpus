</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (&#147;<B>Acorda</B>&#148;) and Biotie Therapies Corp. (&#147;<B>Biotie</B>&#148; or the &#147;<B>Company</B>&#148;) have today
entered into a combination agreement (&#147;<B>Combination Agreement</B>&#148;) whereby Acorda, either directly or through a wholly-owned subsidiary (jointly the &#147;<B>Offeror</B>&#148;), will make a public tender offer in Finland and in the
United States to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares, American Depositary Shares (&#147;<B>ADSs</B>&#148;), stock options, share units and warrants in Biotie that are not owned by Biotie or any of its subsidiaries (the &#147;<B>Tender
Offer</B>&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">The price offered for each share validly tendered into the Tender Offer will be EUR 0.2946 in cash, representing a premium of approximately
95&nbsp;per cent compared to the closing price of the Biotie shares on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd. (&#147;<B>Nasdaq Helsinki</B>&#148;) on 18&nbsp;January 2016, the last trading day on Nasdaq Helsinki preceding this announcement. This represents a premium
of approximately 84&nbsp;per cent compared to the 3 month volume-weighted average trading price on Nasdaq Helsinki and approximately 56&nbsp;per cent compared to the 6 month volume-weighted average trading price on Nasdaq Helsinki. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">The price offered for each ADS will be EUR 23.5680 in cash, payable in the equivalent amount of U.S. dollars determined as near to the payment date as reasonably
practicable based on the U.S. dollar spot rate against the euro exchange rate on the nearest practicable day to the closing date of the Tender Offer. As of January&nbsp;18, 2016, this would be equivalent to 25.60 USD per ADS in cash, based on the
average exchange rate from the last 5 trading days to January&nbsp;15 of 1.0864 USD to 1.00 EUR, representing a premium of approximately 94&nbsp;per cent compared to the closing price of the Biotie ADSs on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC
(&#147;<B>Nasdaq US</B>&#148;) on 15&nbsp;January 2016, the last trading day on the Nasdaq US preceding this announcement. Acorda will also offer to acquire all of the outstanding option rights, share units and warrants issued by Biotie. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">The Board of Directors of Biotie recommends that the holders of Biotie shares, ADSs, option rights, share units and warrants accept the Tender Offer. The Board&#146;s
decision has been unanimous. The Board of Directors of Biotie will issue its complete statement regarding the Tender Offer in accordance with the Finnish Securities Market Act before the commencement of the Tender Offer. In connection with the
Tender Offer, the Board of Directors of Biotie has received an opinion from Biotie&#146;s financial advisor. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Certain factors considered by the Board of Directors
of Biotie when giving its recommendation include (i)&nbsp;the costs required to gain approval and to subsequently launch the products, which could require an additional dilutive financing, (ii)&nbsp;the various strategic alternatives available to
the Company, taking into account discussions with other possible counterparties; (iii)&nbsp;the risks of a successful launch of the products for the Company to be able to realize the full economic value of the products and (iv)&nbsp;the fact that
the offer is a cash offer and not subject to a financing condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Certain Biotie shareholders and ADS holders representing in total approximately 59&nbsp;per
cent of the outstanding shares and votes in Biotie on a fully diluted basis have subject to certain customary conditions irrevocably undertaken to accept the Tender Offer, including all the holders of Biotie warrants and members of the management
team of Biotie. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">&#147;Our acquisition of Biotie positions Acorda as a leader in Parkinson&#146;s disease therapeutic development, with three clinical-stage compounds that have the
potential to improve the lives of people with Parkinson&#146;s. Tozadenant, Biotie&#146;s most advanced clinical program, is a promising therapy being developed to reduce daily OFF time,&#148; said Ron Cohen, M.D., Acorda&#146;s President and CEO.
&#147;Adenosine A2a receptor antagonists may be the first new class of drugs approved for the treatment of Parkinson&#146;s in the U.S. in over 20 years. Approximately 350,000 people with Parkinson&#146;s in the U.S. experience OFF periods, and if
approved, tozadenant could provide a much needed treatment option.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Dr.&nbsp;Cohen added, &#147;Tozadenant is a compelling opportunity with potential market
exclusivity to 2030. The Phase 2 data were highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful. We are targeting an NDA filing by the end of 2018.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Mr.&nbsp;William&nbsp;M. Burns, Chairman of the Board of Biotie commented &#147;We have carefully assessed the terms and conditions of the Offer and believe that it is

lives of patients with neurological diseases, this transaction will allow Acorda and Biotie to bring together their expertise and resources in order to fully maximize the potential of tozadenant, an A2a receptor antagonist in Phase 3 for
Parkinson&#146;s disease, and SYN120, a dual 5-HT<SUB STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:bottom">6</SUB>/5-HT<SUB STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:bottom">2A</SUB> receptor antagonist in Phase 2 for cognitive and psychotic disorders, and to

TENDER OFFER </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Acorda is a biotechnology company focused on developing therapies that improve the lives of people with neurological disorders, with its common
stock listed on Nasdaq US. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Biotie is a specialized drug development company focused on products for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Through the
acquisition, Acorda will obtain worldwide rights to tozadenant, an oral adenosine A2a receptor antagonist currently in Phase 3 development in Parkinson&#146;s disease (PD). In clinical trials, tozadenant reduced average daily OFF time as an adjunct
to treatment regimens including levodopa. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Further expanding its Parkinson&#146;s pipeline, Acorda will also obtain global rights to SYN-120, an oral, 5-HT6/5-HT2A
dual receptor antagonist in Phase 2 development for Parkinson&#146;s-related dementia, with support from the Michael J. Fox Foundation. </P>
