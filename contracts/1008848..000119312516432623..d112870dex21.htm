   2. | Tender Offer 
---|--- 



   2.1 | Launch of the Tender Offer 
---|--- 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Offeror shall
launch the Tender Offer by means of a stock exchange release to be published
in accordance with the rules of Nasdaq Helsinki and Nasdaq US including the
terms and conditions of the    12 



 

 Tender Offer (the "Launch Announcement") as promptly as practicable after
the date of this Agreement and commence the Tender Offer as promptly as
practicable after the date of the Launch Announcement, which commencement
shall be no later than five (5) banking days after the Offeror has received
the SEC Relief (as defined below). The main terms and conditions of the Tender
Offer shall be substantially in the form attached as Schedule 2.1 hereto,
subject to direction from the SEC and/or the Finnish Financial Supervisory
Authority. Unless extended in accordance with this Agreement and the terms and
conditions of the Tender Offer, the acceptance period under the Tender Offer
shall expire on the date that is twenty (20) business days (for this purpose
calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the US Exchange Act) (the
"Offer Period") after the Tender Offer is commenced in the United States. If
any of the conditions to completion set forth in Section 2.3 is not satisfied
or waived on any scheduled expiration date of the Tender Offer, and provided
that this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to Section 6, the Offer
Period shall be extended by the Offeror from time to time in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer in compliance with applicable
Finnish and United States legal requirements; provided that (a) the Offeror
shall not be required to extend the Tender Offer beyond the Long-stop Date,
(b) the Offeror shall not be required to extend the Tender Offer if prohibited
from doing so based on Applicable Law, having applied to
applicable Governmental Authorities for such extensions up to and including
the Long-stop Date, and (c) no such individual extension shall be for a period
of more than two weeks, unless the Parties otherwise agree. Notwithstanding
the above, should the non-satisfaction of the conditions to completion relate
to condition 2.3(a) only, and should the number of Outstanding Shares
(calculated in accordance with condition 2.3(a)) validly tendered be below
two-thirds (2/3) of the issued and outstanding Shares and voting rights in
the Company after the expiry of the ten (10) week maximum acceptance period
under Finnish law, the Offeror shall have no obligation to further extend the
Tender Offer, unless the Offeror otherwise agrees. 

The Parties shall cooperate with one another and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain from the SEC, as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, exemptive relief with respect to permitting the Tender
Offer to be conducted in accordance with the main terms and conditions of the
Tender Offer set forth in Schedule 2.1 (the "SEC Relief"), provided that, if
the SEC Relief is not obtained by 23 February 2016, the Parties shall
cooperate to restructure the Tender Offer (including, as applicable, by
launching one or more separate tender offers in the United States, Finland or
other jurisdictions and one or more separate tender offers for the
Outstanding Shares, the ADSs or any of the Outstanding Equity Instruments) so
as to permit the Tender Offer to be made without receipt of the SEC Relief.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the preceding
paragraph, the Offeror shall be required to modify the terms and conditions of
the Tender Offer as necessary to comply with any relief, direction or
instruction set forth in any "no action" letter or comment letter from the
SEC or any written communication from the Finnish Financial Supervisory
Authority (including, as applicable, any relief, direction or instruction to
launch one or more separate tender offers in the United States, Finland
or other jurisdictions and one or more separate tender offers for the
Outstanding Shares, the ADSs or any of the Outstanding Equity Instruments);
provided, however, that (i) the Offeror will not be required to increase the
price offered for any Outstanding Shares or Outstanding Equity Instruments,
offer alternative consideration for any Outstanding Shares or Outstanding
Equity Instruments, waive any condition to completion set forth   13 



 

 in Section 2.3, or waive the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6, and (ii) the Company must provide its prior written consent to any
modification for which its consent would be required pursuant to the
immediately following paragraph (assuming for this purpose that the
modification were being made pursuant to such paragraph).

 

For the avoidance of doubt, the Offeror may otherwise amend the terms and
conditions of the Tender Offer as provided for in this Agreement, in the
terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, in the Finnish SMA and other
relevant Finnish laws and in the US Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, provided that, without the prior written consent of
the Company, Offeror shall not:

decrease the consideration set forth in Section 2.2;

     | (ii) |

change the form of consideration to be paid;

     | (v) |

impose additional conditions to completion; or 

---|---|---

material respect of the holders of the Shares, ADSs or Outstanding Equity
Instruments.

If the Offeror resolves to cause said delisting and deregistration, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist the Offeror in such
procedure, including without limitation promptly taking any required corporate
decisions and making any necessary filings to effect such delisting and
deregistration, in each case, subject to compliance with Applicable Law.



   2.6 |

---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Offeror, the Company, and their respective affiliates shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement such

provision of Applicable Law (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company or
the Offeror, as applicable, shall deduct and withhold all Taxes as are
required by applicable Tax law in respect of payments made in accordance with

withholdings or deductions are required to be made at the time such payments   17 



 

 are made. Amounts withheld pursuant to this Section 2.6 and duly and timely
remitted to the proper governmental authority shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of

ADSs) shall take place over the Helsinki Stock Exchange to the extent
possible. The transfer tax, if any, levied on the sale and purchase of the

Instruments are registered, it shall be a condition to such payment, subject
to Applicable Law in relation to the conduct of the Tender Offer, that the
Person requesting such payment shall pay in advance to the Offeror any
transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Outstanding Shares or Outstanding Equity
Instruments or establish to the satisfaction of the Offeror that such tax has
been paid or is not payable.



   3. |

Recommendation by the Companys Board of Directors 

---|--- 



   3.1 |

The Recommendation 

---|--- 
 

The Board of Directors of the Company has, by a unanimous board decision,
decided to recommend that the holders of the Outstanding Shares and the
Outstanding Equity Instruments accept the Tender Offer and tender their
Outstanding Shares and Outstanding Equity Instruments in the Tender Offer and
to issue a formal statement to this effect substantially in the form set out
in Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, it being understood that
the tender offer document, or a draft thereof, has not been available for the
Board of Directors (the "Recommendation"), all as required pursuant to the
Finnish Securities Markets Act and the US Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. The Board of Directors of the Company
undertakes to issue and publish the Recommendation no later than three (3)
banking days after having received the draft of the tender offer document
submitted by the Offeror to the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority for
approval and the Company shall file a duly completed Schedule 14D-9 with the
SEC on the same day that the Offeror files its tender offer document with the
SEC. The fact that the Board of Directors of the Company recommends the
acceptance of the Tender Offer will also be disclosed in the stock exchange
releases announcing the Tender Offer in accordance with Section 5.6 below.



   3.2 |

Cancellation of the Recommendation 

---|--- 



   3.2.1 |

 Fiduciary Duties 

---|--- 
 

Subject to Sections 3.2.2 and 5.2, the Board of Directors of the Company may,
at any time prior to the Closing Date, cancel or change the Recommendation
if, and only if, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith due to an Effect occurring after the date hereof or an Effect occurring
prior to the date hereof of which the Board of Directors of the Company
was not aware as of the date hereof, after taking advice from its external
legal counsel and financial advisor, that failure to cancel or change the
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors of    18 



 

 the Companys fiduciary duties towards the holders of Outstanding Shares and
the Outstanding Equity Instruments under Finnish laws and guidance on board
duties in the Helsinki Takeover Code (as defined below) (such duties referred
to as the "Fiduciary Duties").

Prior to and as a precondition for cancelling or changing its Recommendation,
as provided above, the Board of Directors of the Company shall (i) promptly
notify the Offeror of its intention to cancel or change the Recommendation,
(ii) in good faith provide the Offeror with an opportunity to negotiate with
the Board of Directors of the Company about matters arising from the changed
circumstances in view of the Tender Offer, and (iii) give the Offeror at least
four (4) banking days from the date of informing the Offeror of the intention
to cancel or change the Recommendation, to enhance the terms and conditions of
its offer. If the Offeror enhances the terms and conditions of its offer such
that the enhanced offer, in the reasonable opinion of the Board of Directors
of the Company rendered in good faith, after taking advice from external legal
counsel and financial advisor, is in the interest of the holders of the
Outstanding Shares and the Outstanding Equity Instruments, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall confirm and uphold the Recommendation for the
Tender Offer, as enhanced.



   3.2.2 |

 Competing Offer 

---|--- 
 

In the event a third party publishes its decision to offer to purchase any or
all Outstanding Shares and Outstanding Equity Instruments through a public
tender offer ("Competing Offer") or the Company receives a written Competing
Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may, subject to the provisions
of this Section 3.2.2 (but not subject to or in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.2.1 above), cancel or change the Recommendation if and
only if it determines in good faith, after taking advice from external legal
counsel and financial advisor that the Competing Offer or Competing Proposal,
judged as a whole, is superior from a financial point of view to the Offerors
offer (including to the extent enhanced, as described below), and that
therefore it would no longer be in the best interest of the holders of
the Outstanding Shares and the Outstanding Equity Instruments to accept the
Tender Offer and that failure to cancel or change the Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the Board of Directors Fiduciary Duties; provided that
simultaneously with cancelling or changing the Recommendation in accordance
with this Section 3.2.2 with respect to a Competing Proposal that is not a
Competing Offer, the Company shall enter into a definitive written agreement
with respect to such Competing Proposal.

Prior to and as a precondition for cancelling or changing its Recommendation
in response to a Competing Offer or a Competing Proposal, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall (i) comply with its obligations under Section
5.2, (ii) promptly notify the Offeror with reasonably detailed information
regarding the Competing Offer or the Competing Proposal (including the
identity of the offeror, pricing and material terms and conditions), (iii) in
good faith provide the Offeror with an opportunity to negotiate with the Board
of Directors of the Company about matters arising from the Competing Offer or
the Competing Proposal, and (iv) give the Offeror at least four (4) banking
days from the earlier of (a) the date of publishing the Competing Offer or (b)
the date of informing the Offeror in writing of the other Competing Proposal,
to enhance its offer pursuant to this Agreement. The Board of Directors of the
Company shall give due consideration to any enhanced offer received from the
Offeror pursuant hereto. In the    19 



 

 event of any material revisions to the Competing Offer or the Competing
Proposal for which notice was previously given by the Company pursuant to the
first sentence of this paragraph, the Company shall be required to deliver a
new written notice and to comply again with the requirements set forth in the
first two sentences of this paragraph, except that the Company shall give the
Offeror at least two (2) banking days from the date of publishing the
Competing Offer, or from the date of informing the Offeror in writing of the
Competing Proposal, to enhance its offer pursuant to this Agreement (rather
than the four (4) banking days otherwise contemplated by the first
sentence of this paragraph).

If a Competing Offer is published or if the Offeror is informed in writing of
a Competing Proposal in accordance with the above and Section 5.2 but the
Offeror enhances its offer as described above such that the enhanced offer, in
the opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company rendered in good faith,
after taking advice from reputable external legal counsel and financial
advisor, is at least equally favorable to the holders of the Outstanding
Shares and the Outstanding Equity Instruments as the Competing Offer or the
Competing Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company shall confirm and
uphold the Recommendation for the Tender Offer, as enhanced.

   4.3 |

Representations and warranties by the Offeror 

---|--- 



   4.3.1 |

Organization and qualification 

---|--- 
 

The Offeror has been validly incorporated and exists in accordance with the
laws of Delaware, United States and has the requisite power and authority and
all necessary governmental approvals, licenses and permits necessary to own,
use and operate its property and to carry on its business as presently
conducted in all material respects.

 



   4.3.2 |

Authority relative to this Agreement 

---|--- 
 

This Agreement has been duly authorised and validly executed and delivered by
the Offeror and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Offeror enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject, in each
case, to the effect of bankruptcy, moratorium, reorganization, administration,
insolvency, recovery, attachment and other mandatory laws
affecting creditors rights generally. The Offeror has all necessary
corporate power and authority, and has taken all necessary corporate action,
to duly authorise and execute this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein to be
consummated by it in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.



   4.3.3 |

Sufficient financing 

---|--- 
 

The Offeror, following the closing of the Equity Sale, will have and will
maintain through the Closing sufficient finances available (including
finances available under any Replacement Financing) to complete the Tender
Offer, and will finance the Tender Offer through cash on its balance sheet and
proceeds of the Equity Sale and any Replacement Financing, and no other third
party financing is required by the Offeror to complete the Tender Offer and
subsequent acquisition (including compulsory redemption) of any remaining
Shares and Outstanding Equity Instruments.

 

Concurrently with the Offerors entry into this Agreement, the Offeror has
entered into a purchase agreement (the "Equity Purchase Agreement") with J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC (the "Purchaser") pursuant to which the Purchaser has
committed to purchase   32 



 

 $75,000,000 of shares of common stock, par value $0.001, of the Offeror (the
"Equity Sale"). The Offeror has delivered to the Company a true and complete
copy of the form of Equity Purchase Agreement and will promptly deliver to
the Company a true and complete copy of the executed Equity Purchase
Agreement. There are no side letters (other than engagement or related letters
(none of which contain terms that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the amount or closing of the Equity Sale)) related to the Equity Sale.

As of its signing on the date hereof, (i) the Equity Purchase Agreement is a
valid and binding obligation of the Offeror and, to the knowledge of the
Offeror, the Purchaser, and (ii) no event has occurred which would constitute
a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute a default), or the failure of any condition, on the part of the
Offeror or, to the knowledge of the Offeror, the Purchaser under the Equity
Purchase Agreement. There are no conditions precedent to the closing of the
Equity Sale and receipt by the Offeror of the net proceeds of the Equity Sale
other than the conditions precedent set forth in the Equity Purchase
Agreement, and the Offeror has no reason to believe that it will not be able
to satisfy any closing condition in the Equity Purchase Agreement or that the
full amount of net proceeds of the Equity Sale will not be paid to the Offeror
on or before January 26, 2016.

 

The Offeror acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the closing of the Equity Sale or any Replacement
Financing shall not be a condition to the obligation of the Offeror to
consummate the Tender Offer and the other transactions contemplated hereby.



   4.3.4 |

Disclosure Documents 

---|--- 
 

The Tender Offer documents, when filed and distributed or disseminated, will
comply as to form in all material respects with applicable rules,
regulations, all other Applicable Laws and, at the time of such filing or the
filing of any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time of such
distribution or dissemination and at the time of consummation of the Tender
Offer, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The representations and warranties in this Section will not
apply to statements or omissions included or incorporated by reference in the
Tender Offer documents based upon information supplied to the Offeror by the
Company or any of its representatives or advisors specifically for use or
incorporation by reference therein.



   4.3.5 |

As of the date hereof, neither the Offeror nor any of its affiliates has
entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case,
whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any
contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or
written), pursuant to which: (a) any holder of Shares, ADSs or Outstanding
Equity Instruments would be entitled to receive consideration of a different
amount or nature than the consideration specified in Section 2.2 or, except
for the irrevocable undertakings referred to in clause F in the    33 



 

 background, pursuant to which any holder of Shares, ADSs or Outstanding
Equity Instruments agrees to tender such instruments into the Tender Offer or
otherwise sell such instruments to the Offeror or (b) any third party has
agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, equity capital to the Offeror or
its affiliates to finance in whole or in part the Tender Offer or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Other than this Agreement, as of the date hereof, there are no contracts,
undertakings, commitments, agreements or obligations or understandings,
except for the irrevocable undertakings referred to in clause F in the
background, between the Offeror or any of its affiliates, on the one hand, and
any member of the Companys management or the Board of Directors of
the Company, on the other hand, relating in any way to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Company after the
Closing.



   4.4 |

Effect and Breach of Warranties

the Tender Offer thereby having no further effect after the Closing Date.

consents, approvals or waivers from or provide any such notices to third

The Offerors reasonable best efforts under clause (a) of this Section 5.1
shall include the obligation to divest, hold separate, or enter into any
license or restriction on the ownership or operation of the Offeror or the
Company, provided that in no event shall the Offeror be obligated to divest,
hold separate, or enter into any license or restriction on the ownership or
operation of the Offeror or the Company unless such divestment, holding
separate or entry into license or restriction on the ownership or operation
would not have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the business of the Offeror and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (with the business of the Offeror and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, deemed for purposes of this proviso to be
equivalent in size to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole) (a "Burdensome Effect"). In the event of any claim asserted by any
Governmental Authority under Applicable Law, and prior to the Long-stop Date,
the Offeror shall use its reasonable best efforts to oppose (which reasonable
best efforts shall include, in the event of any such claim asserted in court,
by litigating in opposition to) any claim that would prevent the completion
of the Tender Offer from occurring, including if such claim would have a
Burdensome Effect.

 

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each of the Parties undertake to
comply with the Helsinki Takeover Code issued by the Finnish Securities
Market Association, in force as of 1 January 2014 (the "Helsinki Takeover

without limitation, in the case of the Offeror, at the reasonable request of
the Company, by sending a marketing letter to all shareholders of the Company

publishing an advertisement in one Finnish national and one Finnish business
newspaper of its choice regarding the Tender Offer, and by engaging a
reputable financial adviser experienced in communicating with retail investors
in the Finnish market in connection with the technical implementation of the

consideration (monetary or otherwise) to the shareholders of the Company
(other than the consideration to be paid by the Offeror in the Tender Offer).   35

except as provided in clause (c) below, not to solicit, knowingly encourage,
facilitate or promote or discuss with or provide confidential
information with respect to the Company to any Person in connection with any

to cease and cause to be terminated any discussions, negotiations or other
activities related to any Competing Proposal conducted prior to the Signing

not to, upon receipt of a Competing Proposal or a Competing Offer, directly or
indirectly, knowingly facilitate, promote, or encourage or discuss with
or provide confidential information with respect to the Company to the
Persons making such Competing Proposal ("Promoting Measures"), unless the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after having
received advice from external legal counsel and financial advisor, that the
failure to take such Promoting Measures would be inconsistent with the
Fiduciary Duties of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company shall
promptly provide the Offeror any information regarding the Company provided
to any third party to the extent such information has not been previously
provided to the Offeror; 

---|---|---

communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

conferences and discussions. Each party shall provide all such assistance as
is reasonably requested by the other in the preparation and conduct of any
such scheduled meetings, conferences and discussions, including any
inspections by regulatory authorities with respect to any Covered Product.
Upon the Offerors request, the Company shall (a) provide the Offeror with a
reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments with respect to (and

material correspondence or other material communication proposed to
be submitted or otherwise transmitted to a regulatory authority by or on
behalf of any of the Company relating to a Covered Product, and (b) keep the

of Directors of the Company and/or each of the Persons employed by or serving
the Company or its subsidiaries with annual base compensation exceeding
$100,000 USD (or its equivalent); and/or

    5.4 |

Access to information 

---|--- 
 

Upon the Offerors request, and subject to Applicable Law and appropriate
restrictions for confidential and/or competitively sensitive information, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to give any information
regarding the Company or its subsidiaries to the Offeror that:



     | (a) |

the Offeror may reasonably need in preparation of the competition filings or
any other regulatory filings referred to in Section 5.1 and of the
tender offer documentation related to the Tender Offer; and/or 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

the Offeror may otherwise reasonably require for the purposes of the Tender
Offer and other transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including
without limitation, for preparing the Schedule TO to be filed with the SEC or
obtaining the SEC Relief (including, without limitation, providing information
to the Offeror regarding the number of Outstanding Shares, ADSs and
Outstanding Equity Instruments held by U.S. holders (within the meaning of,
and as determined under, Rule 14d-1 under the US Exchange Act)) and the offer
document to be filed with the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority,
provided that the Offeror shall always have access to all information needed
to evaluate the existence of an actual or potential breach of Warranty or a
Material Adverse Effect. 

---|---|--- 
 

Subject to Applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall also (and
shall cause its representatives and subsidiaries to) afford to the officers
and other authorized representatives of the Offeror, reasonable access, during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Closing Date, to its
employees, properties, books, contracts, personnel files and records and,
during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its subsidiaries to)
furnish to the Offeror all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may be reasonably requested by the Offeror, provided that no
investigation or provision of information pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company herein, provided, further, that notwithstanding the investigation or
provision of information by any party, no party shall be deemed to make any
representation or warranty except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such manner
as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the
Company and its subsidiaries.

Promptly, but no later than thirty (30) days, after the date hereof,
the Company shall provide to the Offeror a list of all issuance, renewal,
maintenance and other payments and of any other actions (including filings and
responses to office actions) required to be taken in order to maintain any
Scheduled IP owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide to the Offeror such
information and list with respect to all Scheduled IP not owned by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by
promptly requesting the applicable information from any Company Licensor)
which, in each case, to the Knowledge of the Company, are required to be, as
applicable, made or taken with respect to the Scheduled IP within one hundred
eighty (180) days of the date of the Signing Date. With respect to any and all
Required Actions (as defined in this sentence below) required to be taken to
maintain any Scheduled IP that have deadlines which fall within the period
prior to and as of the Closing Date and/or within the one hundred twenty
(120) days of the date hereof, (i) the Company shall, with respect to
Scheduled IP owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (or with respect
to which the Company or its subsidiary has primary prosecution and/or
maintenance rights), pay all issuance, renewal, maintenance and other
payments, and take any other actions (including making filings and responding
to office actions) in    40 



 

 order to maintain the Scheduled IP (collectively, "Required Actions"), in
each case, by the earlier of (x) the deadline and (y) the Closing Date, and
(ii) the Company shall, with respect to Scheduled IP not owned by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, use reasonable best efforts to promptly and timely
request the applicable Company Licensor to, in a timely manner, take any
Required Actions (including to pay any applicable maintenance or renewal
payments), in each case, by the earlier of (x) the deadline and (y) the
Closing Date, and the Company shall follow up as reasonably needed with such
Company Licensor and keep the Offeror reasonably updated. The Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to provide the Offeror with a list of the
Companys and its subsidiaries key contacts for these matters for each
Company Licensor, including such persons name and contact details, and a list
of any prosecution counsel that handles any of these matters on behalf of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries and such other similar information as may
be reasonably requested by the Offeror from time, solely for use post-
Closing.

In case any insider information as defined in the Finnish SMA or any material
non-public information within the meaning of the United States federal
securities laws is disclosed to the Offeror, the Company undertakes to publish
such information prior to or in connection with the announcement of the Tender
Offer in accordance with Section 5.6 below in order to enable the Offeror to
launch and complete the Tender Offer without breaching any applicable insider
laws or regulations.



   5.5 |

Notice of certain events 

---|--- 
 

Each Party shall, without delay, notify the other Party in writing if it
becomes aware of an event, change or circumstance that could or can
reasonably be expected to result in or constitute a breach of Warranty made or
to be made by that Party or constitute a Material Adverse Effect or that would
delay or impede such Partys ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or to fulfil its obligations set forth in this
Agreement.



   5.6 |

Public announcements 

---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding Section 3 of the Confidentiality Agreement, the Parties agree
that the stock exchange releases to be published by the Parties in connection
with the announcement of the Tender Offer and this Agreement shall be in the
form of Schedule 5.6. The Parties shall otherwise consult with each other
before issuing any releases or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereunder, and
shall not issue any such release or announcement without the other Partys
prior written approval, unless required to do so by Applicable Law
or relevant stock exchange regulations and only provided that it is not
practically possible to consult and obtain the approval of the other Party
prior to such release or announcement.

 



   5.7 |

General meeting of shareholders 

---|--- 
 

The Board of Directors of the Company shall not convene a general meeting of
shareholders of the Company to address the Tender Offer or any matter which
would have a material effect on the Tender Offer except as provided in this
Agreement or except as required by mandatory law or, subject to the Company
having complied with   41 



 

 its obligations under Sections 3.2 and 5.2 above, if the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith, after taking advice from external
legal counsel and financial advisor, that failure to convene a general
meeting of shareholders would be inconsistent with the Fiduciary Duties of the
Board of Directors.

It is understood and agreed that as soon as the Offeror has publicly
confirmed that it will complete the Tender Offer, the Board of Directors of
the Company will, at the Offerors request, convene an extraordinary general
meeting of shareholders of the Company for the purpose of electing new
members to the Board of Directors and addressing other agenda items proposed
by the Offeror, if any.

 

The Offeror shall subsequently grant the resigning members of the Board of
Directors of the Company discharge from liability at the next Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders of the Company following the Closing Date and, with
respect to the financial year started January 1, 2016, at the Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders of the Company where the financial statements
for such financial year are considered, provided that no material findings to
the contrary are made in the audit of the Companys financial statements for
the respective accounting periods or otherwise.

 



   5.8 |

Director and Officer Liability 

---|--- 
 

For six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Offeror and the Company shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former directors and officers of
the Company and its subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, provided, however, that no such obligation shall
arise with respect to acts or omissions finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to amount to fraud, willful misconduct, criminal
activity or a breach of the duty of loyalty and that nothing herein shall be
construed as a requirement on the Offeror or the Company to effect any change
to the Articles of Association of the Company. In the event that any
Indemnified Person is made party to any action, litigation, claim, suit,
investigation or proceeding (an "Action") arising out of or relating to
matters that would be indemnifiable pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Offeror and the Company shall advance fees, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) as incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with and prior to the final disposition of
such Action, subject to the execution by such Indemnified Person of
appropriate undertakings to repay such advanced fees, costs and expenses if
it is ultimately determine that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to
indemnification. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall
limit the right of the Company to claim damages from its directors under the
Finnish Companies Act, provided that this shall not affect the undertakings
and obligations of the Offeror in this Section 5.8.

 

Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall or, if the Company is unable to,
Offeror shall cause Company after the Closing Date to, obtain and fully pay
the premium for the extension of the directors and officers liability
coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies
and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six years from and after the Closing Date with
respect to any claim related to any period at or prior to the Closing Date
from an insurance   42 



 

 carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in
such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Closing Date
(including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby). If the Company for any reason fails to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Closing Date, the Offeror or the Company
shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from
and after the Closing Date, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as
of the date hereof, or the Offeror shall cause the Company to purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided
in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof. In no event shall
the Offeror be required to, and the Company shall not, expend for such
policies pursuant to the previous sentence an annual premium amount in excess
of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year
(it being agreed that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Closing Date, for a cost not exceeding such amount).

In the event that the Offeror, the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of such Person
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

 

The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 5.8 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under Applicable Law. These
rights shall survive consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.



   5.9 |

Employee Matters 

---|--- 
 

(a) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (or, such shorter period of employment, as
the case may be), Offeror shall provide the employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries who remain employed by the Offeror or any of its subsidiaries
(the "Continuing Employees") shall receive from Offeror (i) an annual rate of
salary or wages that is no less favorable than the annual rate of salary or
wages provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its subsidiaries
as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) bonus opportunities and
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
bonus opportunities or employee benefits, as applicable, provided by the
Offeror to its similarly situated employees and (iii) severance benefits that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the severance benefits
provided by the Offeror to its similarly situated employees.   43 



 

(b) As of the Closing Date and solely with respect to Continuing
Employees, should the Offeror elect to transition a Continuing Employee from a
Company employee benefit plan to a welfare plan of the Offeror, the Offeror
shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to
waive all limitations as to any pre-existing condition, actively-at-work
requirements or waiting periods in its applicable welfare plans with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) under any welfare plans that
such Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) may be eligible
to participate in after the Closing and to credit each Continuing Employee
(and his or her eligible dependents) for any copayments, deductibles, offsets
or similar payments made under a company plan during the plan year that
includes the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying any applicable copayment,
deductible, offset or similar requirements under the comparable plans of the
Offeror or any of its subsidiaries. In addition, as of the Closing Date, the
Offeror shall and shall cause any applicable subsidiary to, give Continuing
Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting, participation
in, benefit plan accruals and determination of level of benefits under any
employee benefit and compensation plans or arrangements (other than with
respect to defined benefit plans or where such service credit would result in
duplication of benefits) maintained by the Offeror or an applicable
subsidiary that such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate in
after the Closing Date for such Continuing Employees service with the Company
or any of its subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer)
to the same extent that such service was credited for purposes of any
comparable Company employee benefit plan immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.9, the
provisions of Sections 5.9(a) and (b) shall apply only with respect to
Continuing Employees who are employed in the United States. With respect to
Continuing Employees not described in the preceding sentence, Offeror shall,
and shall cause its subsidiaries to, comply with all Applicable Laws,
directives and regulations relating to employees and employee benefits matters
applicable to such employees.

 

(d) Effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Closing Date
and contingent upon the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary
to terminate the employee benefit plan(s) (including the adoption of
resolutions by the board of directors of the Company sponsoring such employee
benefit plan(s) in a form reasonably acceptable to Offeror) sponsored by the
Company or its subsidiaries intended to qualify as qualified cash or deferred
arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Company
401(k) Plan"). Effective on or as soon as administratively practicable
following the Closing Date, each employee of any Company who is a participant
in a Company 401(k) Plan (each, an "401(k) Participant") shall be allowed to
participate in a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code that is sponsored and maintained by Offeror or
one of its Affiliates (the "Offeror 401(k) Plan"). As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, Offeror shall take, or cause to be taken, any and
all actions as may be required, including amendments to the Company 401(k)
Plan(s) and/or the Offeror 401(k) Plan to permit, as applicable, (i) the
account balances of each 401(k) Participant to be distributed in accordance
with the terms of such plan and Applicable Law and (ii) the 401(k)
Participants who are participants in such plan to roll over any
such distributions (including a rollover of up to one (1) outstanding
participant loan per 401(k) Participant) into the Offeror 401(k) Plan.   44 



 

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, Offeror and the Company shall cooperate
in good faith to complete an analysis of any potential Tax liability or loss
of Tax deduction under Sections 280G or 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code that
may result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns, and no
current or former employee, individual consultant, individual independent
contractor, individual self-employed contractor leased employee or director of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each, a "Company Service Provider")
or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose
as a third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.9. In no event shall the terms
of this Agreement be deemed to confer upon any Company Service Provider any
right to continued employment with the Offeror or any of its affiliates
(including, following the Closing Date, the Company). Nothing herein shall be
deemed to establish, amend, modify or cause to be adopted any Company
employee benefit plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by the Offeror or the Company or any of
their respective affiliates.

 



   5.10 |

Financing 

---|--- 

The Offeror shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
obtain the proceeds from the Equity Sale. Without limiting the foregoing, from
and after the date hereof, the Offeror shall not agree to any amendment or
modification to be made to, or to any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Equity Purchase Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company
if such amendments, modifications or waivers would reasonably be expected to
(x) reduce the aggregate amount of funds or commitments payable to the Offeror
under the Equity Purchase Agreement or (y) impose new or additional conditions
precedent to the closing of the Equity Sale.

If any portion of the Equity Sale becomes unavailable in the manner or from
the sources contemplated in the Equity Purchase Agreement, the Offeror shall
notify the Company and shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary or desirable to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative
sources as promptly as practicable, to the extent such financing is necessary
to complete the Tender Offer and subsequent acquisition (including compulsory
redemption) of any remaining Shares and Outstanding Equity Instruments.

 

If and to the extent that the Equity Sale is replaced, supplemented or
superseded by any alternative financing ("Replacement Financing") in
accordance with the terms hereof, the terms "Equity Sale", "Equity Purchase
Agreement" and "Purchaser" shall each be deemed to be modified,
_mutatis mutandis_ , to refer to such alternative financing and any financing
sources and commitments with respect thereto.   45 



    6. |

the Closing Date has not occurred by 19 June 2016 (the "Long-stop Date"),
provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section

cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing Date to occur by such
date.

Termination by the Company 

---|--- 
 

 __The Company may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect at any time
prior to the Closing Date by giving to the Offeror a written notice thereof

of the Offeror set forth in this Agreement and such failure is incapable of
being cured prior to the Long-stop Date or, if capable of being cured prior
to the Long-stop Date, has not been cured within thirty (30) days of the
Company providing written notice thereof, or (ii) any of the representations
and warranties of the Offeror are not true and correct in all respects,
where such failure to be true and correct in all respects (A) would,

consummation of the Tender Offer prior to the Long-stop Date and (B) is
incapable of being cured prior to the Long-stop Date or, if capable of being
cured prior to the Long-stop Date, has not been cured within thirty (30) days
of the Company providing written notice thereof; _provided_ that, at the time

    6.3 | Termination by the Offeror 
---|--- 

The Offeror may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect at any time
prior to the Closing Date by giving the Company a written notice thereof if at
least one of the following events occurs:



     | (a) |

the Board of Directors of the Company has, for any reason whatsoever,

or agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

any of the Warranties set forth in Section 4.2.6 are not true and correct in
all respects, except where the failure of such Warranties to be so true
and correct is _de minimis_ ; 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

any of the Warranties set forth in (i) the first paragraph of Section 4.2.1 or
(ii) the first paragraph of Section 4.2.2 (in the case of each of sub-clauses

or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers set forth therein), are not true and
correct in all material respects; or  

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

any of the other Warranties set forth in this Agreement (without giving effect
to any qualification as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect"
qualifiers set forth therein) are not true and correct in all respects, except
where the failure of such Warranties to be so true and correct would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, 

---|---|--- 

_provided_ that, (1) in the case of each of clauses (a) through (e), at the
time of the delivery of such notice of termination, the Offeror shall not be
in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and (2) in the case

In case of any termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Offeror shall

expiration) withdraw the Tender Offer and shall not acquire any Outstanding
Shares or Outstanding Equity Instruments pursuant thereto.

Any termination or expiration shall be without prejudice to any remedies
available to the Parties under this Agreement or under law for breach of a
contractual obligation, it being understood, however, that the non-breaching
Party shall be entitled to claim solely direct damages of the non-breaching
Party pursuant to this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall, however,
limit a Partys liability for fraud or willful misconduct.   47 



 

If this Agreement is, as a result of a Competing Offer or a Competing
Proposal, terminated by the Company on the basis of Section 6.2(a) or by the
Offeror on the basis of Section 6.3(a), the Company shall pay to the Offeror a
termination fee of USD $4,500,000 as compensation for the Offerors reasonable
costs for the evaluation, negotiation and preparation of the Tender Offer.
Such termination fee shall be paid by the Company upon termination of this
Agreement in immediately available funds to a bank account identified by the
Offeror.

 

If this Agreement is terminated by the Company on the basis of Section 6.2 as
a result of a Competing Offer, and the Offeror nevertheless confirms its
intention to enhance the Tender Offer in writing, the Company shall allow the
Offeror the possibility to conduct further due diligence on terms equal to
those applied with respect to the third party offeror making said Competing
Offer, provided that the Company shall not be required to allow the Offeror to
conduct further diligence if the Company has entered into a definitive
agreement providing for a Competing Offer, provided, further that the Offeror
shall be treated (i) on the same terms as any other third party in connection
with making unsolicited offers under such other definitive agreement
(including with respect to diligence and information access) and (ii) in
accordance with the principles set forth in the Helsinki Takeover Code.

Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, the following Sections
shall survive: 5.6, 6.4 and 7 and, in the event the Tender Offer is
completed, also the following Sections shall survive: 2.5, 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9.

Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and

deemed to guarantee, as for its own debt ( _fi. omavelkainen takaus_ ), the

---|--- 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the

Subject to Section 7.8, all disputes arising out of or relating to the

Commerce (the "ICC Rules").

 

The arbitral tribunal shall be comprised of three arbitrators to be appointed
as follows: each party shall nominate one person to act as arbitrator in
accordance with Article 12(4) of the ICC Rules and the two selected shall
nominate a third arbitrator within 10 days of the confirmation of their
appointment. If the arbitrators nominated by the parties are unable or fail to
agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by
the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.

Either party may apply to the arbitral tribunal for injunctive relief until
the arbitral award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved.
Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under this agreement, seek
from any competent judicial    50 



 

 authority any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the
rights or property of that party, at any stage pending final determination of
the dispute by the arbitral tribunal. 

Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each party will, upon the
written request of the other party, promptly provide the other with copies of
documents relevant to the issues raised by any claim or counterclaim. The
party to whom the request is directed must respond in writing within 20 days
after receipt of the requests. Objections, if any, must state
with specificity the grounds for objecting to the request. Any dispute
regarding document production, or the relevance or scope thereof, shall be
determined by the arbitral tribunal, which determination shall be conclusive.
All document production shall be completed within 90 days following the
appointment of the arbitral tribunal.

Each party shall be entitled to examine the other partys witnesses by way of
deposition. Depositions shall be limited to a maximum of five per party and
shall be held within 30 days of the making of a written request. Additional

by the arbitral tribunal.

 

The arbitration shall be conducted in English in London, United Kingdom, and
judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction thereof.



   7.8 | Specific Performance 
---|--- 

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Party
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a precautionary measure,
temporary procedural remedy, temporary restraining order or preliminary
injunction where necessary to protect its interests and shall be entitled to
such relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement pending the commencement or

as set forth below.

Subject to the following paragraph, if at the scheduled expiration time of the
Tender Offer any of the Conditions to Completion (as defined below) are not
satisfied, the Offeror will extend the Offer Period for additional periods not
exceeding two (2) weeks each in accordance with these terms and conditions
and, in each case, subject to compliance with applicable Finnish and United
States legal requirements. The Offeror will give notice of the possible

If the Offeror extends the Offer Period, the Offer Period will expire on the

maximum duration of the Offer Period (including any extended Offer Period) is
ten (10) weeks as required under Finnish law. However, if any of the

to as the "Subsequent Offer Period"). In the event of such Subsequent Offer
Period, the Subsequent Offer Period will expire on the date and at the time
determined by the Offeror in the final result announcement. Any Subsequent

ACORDA PRESS RELEASE 19 January 2016 at 9:45 a.m. (EET)

ACORDA ANNOUNCES A RECOMMENDED CASH TENDER OFFER FOR ALL SHARES, ADSs AND
OTHER EQUITY INSTRUMENTS IN BIOTIE 

Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. ("Acorda") and Biotie Therapies Corp. ("Biotie" or
the "Company") have today entered into a combination agreement ("Combination
Agreement") whereby Acorda, either directly or through a wholly-owned
subsidiary (jointly the "Offeror"), will make a public tender offer in Finland
and in the United States to purchase all of the issued and outstanding
shares, American Depositary Shares ("ADSs"), stock options, share units and
warrants in Biotie that are not owned by Biotie or any of its subsidiaries
(the "Tender Offer").

The price offered for each share validly tendered into the Tender Offer will
be EUR 0.2946 in cash, representing a premium of approximately 95 per cent
compared to the closing price of the Biotie shares on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd.
("Nasdaq Helsinki") on 18 January 2016, the last trading day on Nasdaq
Helsinki preceding this announcement. This represents a premium of
approximately 84 per cent compared to the 3 month volume-weighted average
trading price on Nasdaq Helsinki and approximately 56 per cent compared to the
6 month volume-weighted average trading price on Nasdaq Helsinki.

 

The price offered for each ADS will be EUR 23.5680 in cash, payable in the
equivalent amount of U.S. dollars determined as near to the payment date as
reasonably practicable based on the U.S. dollar spot rate against the euro
exchange rate on the nearest practicable day to the closing date of the Tender
Offer. As of January 18, 2016, this would be equivalent to 25.60 USD per ADS
in cash, based on the average exchange rate from the last 5 trading days to
January 15 of 1.0864 USD to 1.00 EUR, representing a premium of approximately
94 per cent compared to the closing price of the Biotie ADSs on the Nasdaq
Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq US") on 15 January 2016, the last trading day on
the Nasdaq US preceding this announcement. Acorda will also offer to acquire
all of the outstanding option rights, share units and warrants issued by
Biotie.

 

The Board of Directors of Biotie recommends that the holders of Biotie shares,
ADSs, option rights, share units and warrants accept the Tender Offer. The
Boards decision has been unanimous. The Board of Directors of Biotie will
issue its complete statement regarding the Tender Offer in accordance with the
Finnish Securities Market Act before the commencement of the Tender Offer. In
connection with the Tender Offer, the Board of Directors of Biotie has
received an opinion from Bioties financial advisor.

Certain factors considered by the Board of Directors of Biotie when giving
its recommendation include (i) the costs required to gain approval and to
subsequently launch the products, which could require an additional dilutive
financing, (ii) the various strategic alternatives available to the Company,
taking into account discussions with other possible counterparties; (iii) the
risks of a successful launch of the products for the Company to be able to
realize the full economic value of the products and (iv) the fact that the
offer is a cash offer and not subject to a financing condition.

Certain Biotie shareholders and ADS holders representing in total
approximately 59 per cent of the outstanding shares and votes in Biotie on a
fully diluted basis have subject to certain customary conditions irrevocably
undertaken to accept the Tender Offer, including all the holders of Biotie
warrants and members of the management team of Biotie. Board Member Mr. Don M Bailey, Vivo Capital, whose venture partner is Board
Member Mr. Mahendra G. Shah, and Versant Euro Ventures, whose partner is
Board Member Mr. Guido Magni, representing in total approximately 27 per cent
of the outstanding shares and votes in Biotie on a fully diluted basis (which
is included in the 59 per cent mentioned in the paragraph above), have
subject to certain customary conditions irrevocably undertaken to accept the
Tender Offer. Mr. Bailey, Vivo Capital and Versant Euro Ventures have made the
commitment in question after Bioties Board of Directors approved the entry
into the Combination Agreement. Board Members Mr. Bailey, Mr. Shah and Mr.
Magni shall not participate in the giving of the Board of Directors statement
regarding the Tender Offer.

 

"Our acquisition of Biotie positions Acorda as a leader in Parkinsons disease
therapeutic development, with three clinical-stage compounds that have
the potential to improve the lives of people with Parkinsons. Tozadenant,
Bioties most advanced clinical program, is a promising therapy being
developed to reduce daily OFF time," said Ron Cohen, M.D., Acordas President
and CEO. "Adenosine A2a receptor antagonists may be the first new class of
drugs approved for the treatment of Parkinsons in the U.S. in over 20 years.
Approximately 350,000 people with Parkinsons in the U.S. experience OFF
periods, and if approved, tozadenant could provide a much needed treatment
option."

Dr. Cohen added, "Tozadenant is a compelling opportunity with potential
market exclusivity to 2030. The Phase 2 data were highly statistically
significant and clinically meaningful. We are targeting an NDA filing by the
end of 2018."

 

Mr. William M. Burns, Chairman of the Board of Biotie commented "We have
carefully assessed the terms and conditions of the Offer and believe that it
is an attractive offer to shareholders that recognizes the strategic value of
Biotie."

Mr. Burns continued, "With the shared mission to improve the lives of
patients with neurological diseases, this transaction will allow Acorda and
Biotie to bring together their expertise and resources in order to fully
maximize the potential of tozadenant, an A2a receptor antagonist in Phase 3
for Parkinsons disease, and SYN120, a dual 5-HT6/5-HT2A receptor antagonist
in Phase 2 for cognitive and psychotic disorders, and to bring new medicines
to patients. We are excited about this offer for our shareholders, the Biotie
team and for patients."

BACKGROUND AND REASONS FOR THE TENDER OFFER

Acorda is a biotechnology company focused on developing therapies that improve
the lives of people with neurological disorders, with its common stock listed
on Nasdaq US.

Biotie is a specialized drug development company focused on products for
neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Through the acquisition, Acorda
will obtain worldwide rights to tozadenant, an oral adenosine A2a receptor
antagonist currently in Phase 3 development in Parkinsons disease (PD). In
clinical trials, tozadenant reduced average daily OFF time as an adjunct to
treatment regimens including levodopa.

Further expanding its Parkinsons pipeline, Acorda will also obtain global
rights to SYN-120, an oral, 5-HT6/5-HT2A dual receptor antagonist in Phase 2
development for Parkinsons-related dementia, with support from the Michael J.
Fox Foundation. The acquisition also includes two other assets: BTT1023, a fully human
monoclonal antibody in Phase 2 development for primary sclerosing cholangitis
(PSC), a chronic liver disease; and Selincro, a European Medicines Agency
(EMA)-approved therapy for reduction of alcohol consumption marketed by H.
Lundbeck A/S in multiple European countries and for which the
Company receives royalties.

THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE TENDER OFFER

The price offered for each share validly tendered into the Tender Offer will
be EUR 0.2946 per share in cash.

The price offered for each ADS will be EUR 23.5680 in cash, payable in the
equivalent amount of U.S. dollars determined as near to the payment date as
reasonably practicable based on the U.S. dollar spot rate against the euro
exchange rate on the nearest practicable day to the closing date of
the Tender Offer.

The price offered for each stock option or share unit issued by Biotie
pursuant to its option and equity incentive plans and convertible into
Biotie shares will be the greater of (i) EUR 0.2946 minus the applicable
subscription price and (ii) EUR 0.01 in cash. The price offered for each
warrant will be EUR 0.1664 in cash.

 

The specific prices for each of the stock options, share units and warrants
have been set out in Annex A of this release.

 

The completion of the Tender Offer will be subject to the following
conditions:



     | (a) | the valid tender of outstanding shares (including
outstanding shares represented by validly tendered ADSs and validly tendered
warrants) representing, together with any outstanding shares (including
outstanding shares represented by ADSs and warrants) otherwise acquired by
the Offeror, more than ninety percent (90%) of the issued and outstanding
shares and voting rights of the Company, calculated on a Fully Diluted Basis
and otherwise in accordance with Chapter 18 Section 1 of the Finnish Limited
Liability Companies Act (21.7.2006/624); as used in this paragraph "Fully
Diluted Basis" means an equation in which the numerator represents the
aggregate number of outstanding shares (including outstanding shares
represented by ADSs) and warrants that have been validly tendered or otherwise
acquired by the Offeror and the denominator represents the aggregate number of
all outstanding shares (including outstanding shares represented by ADSs) and
warrants, as well as shares issuable upon the vesting and exercise of those
outstanding equity instruments (other than warrants) that have not been
validly tendered into the Tender Offer or otherwise acquired by the Offeror;  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | no material adverse effect (as defined in the Combination
Agreement) having occurred in Biotie after 19 January 2016; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | the Offeror not, after 19 January 2016, having received
information previously undisclosed to it that describes a material adverse
effect to the Company that occurred prior to 19 January 2016;  
---|---|--- by the Company to the Offeror being materially inaccurate, incomplete, or
misleading, and the Company not having failed to make public any information
that should have been made public by it under applicable laws, including
without limitation the rules of Nasdaq Helsinki and Nasdaq US, provided that,
in each case, the information made public, disclosed or not disclosed or the
failure to disclose information constitutes a material adverse effect to the
Company; 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | no court or regulatory authority of competent jurisdiction
(including without limitation the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority or
the SEC) having given an order or issued any regulatory action preventing
or enjoining the completion of the Tender Offer; 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | the Board of Directors of the Company having issued its
recommendation for the Tender Offer and the recommendation remaining in force
and not being modified or changed in a manner detrimental to the Offeror;
and  
---|---|--- 



     | (h) | the Combination Agreement not having been terminated and
remaining in force and no event having occurred that, with the passage of
time, would give the Offeror the right to terminate the Combination Agreement
under specified sections of the Combination Agreement that give the Offeror
the right to terminate the Combination Agreement in response to a breach of
the agreement by the Company. 
---|---|--- 
 

The Offeror reserves the right to complete the Tender Offer even if the
conditions to completion of the Tender Offer have not been fulfilled.

 

The Tender Offer will commence after the Offeror has obtained certain
regulatory relief from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which is
expected to be obtained no later than the end of February 2016, and initially
run for twenty (20) banking days. The Offeror reserves the right to extend and
is obligated to extend the acceptance period from time to time in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer.

The Offeror will make the filings required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,
which requires the Offeror to delay the completion of the Tender Offer until
the applicable waiting period pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act has
expired or been terminated. The initial waiting period under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Act is thirty days, unless it is earlier terminated or extended by a
request for additional information. The Offeror currently does not believe
that the completion of the Tender Offer would require regulatory approvals
from competition authorities outside the United States.

 

The Tender Offer will be financed through cash on Acordas balance sheet and
the gross proceeds of a private placement to a banking institution of
approximately USD 75 million of Acordas common stock that was executed
concurrently with the execution of the Combination Agreement and that is
expected to close by 26 January 2016. The Tender Offer is not conditional upon
obtaining any external financing for the Tender Offer.

The detailed terms and conditions of the Tender Offer and information on how
to accept the Tender Offer will be included in the tender offer documents
that will be published by the Offeror before the commencement of the
acceptance period in Finland and in the United States. Acorda and Biotie have undertaken to follow the Helsinki Takeover Code issued
by the Finnish Securities Market Association as referred to in the Finnish
Securities Market Act and will comply with the US Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, subject to any
relief from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

 

On the date of this release, Bioties share capital amounts to EUR
279,218,058.55 and the number of shares issued to 1,089,608,083. The Offeror
does not currently hold any shares, ADSs, option rights, share units or
warrants in Biotie.

COMBINATION AGREEMENT

 

The Combination Agreement sets forth the principal terms under which the
Offeror will make the Tender Offer.

 

Under the Combination Agreement, the Board of Directors of Biotie has
undertaken, in the event of a competing offer, not to cancel or change its
recommendation for the Tender Offer, unless



     | i. | it determines in good faith, after taking advice from
external legal counsel and financial advisor that the competing offer is
superior to the Offerors offer and that therefore it would no longer be in
the best interest of the shareholders, ADS holders and holders of stock
options, share units and warrants of Biotie to accept the Tender Offer and
that failure to cancel or change the Board of Directors recommendation for
the Tender Offer would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors fiduciary
duties towards Bioties shareholders and holders of other equity instruments
under Finnish laws; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | ii. | prior to and as a precondition for cancelling or changing
its recommendation, the Board of Directors has complied with certain agreed
procedures allowing Acorda to assess the competing offer and to enhance the
Tender Offer. 
---|---|--- 

Should Acorda enhance the Tender Offer so as to be at least equally favourable
to Bioties shareholders as the competing offer, the Board of Directors has
undertaken to confirm and uphold the recommendation for the Tender Offer, as
enhanced.

Biotie has also agreed not to, directly or through its representatives,
solicit or encourage any competing offers or proposals for such offers or
other transactions competing with the Tender Offer, nor to facilitate or
promote any such competing proposals, unless the Board of Directors has
determined that, with respect to an unsolicited competing proposal, failure
to take such measures would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors
fiduciary duties. Biotie has agreed to inform Acorda of any competing
proposals and to provide Acorda an opportunity to negotiate with the Board of
Directors of Biotie on matters arising from such competing proposals.

The Combination Agreement further includes certain representations,
warranties and undertakings by both parties customary in transactions of a
similar nature, such as conduct of business by Biotie in the ordinary course
of business before the completion of the Tender Offer and cooperation by
the parties in necessary regulatory filings and in completing the Tender
Offer in the most expeditious manner practicable. Biotie has further undertaken to compensate Acorda for its reasonable
transaction costs in the amount of USD 4,500,000 in the event the Combination
Agreement is terminated in connection with the Board of Directors of Biotie
withdrawing or changing its recommendation for the Tender Offer.

 

Acordas intention is to cause the shares of Biotie to be delisted from Nasdaq
Helsinki and the ADSs to be delisted from Nasdaq US as soon as permitted
and reasonably practicable under applicable laws and regulations.

The foregoing summary is not complete and is qualified by reference to the
full text of the Combination Agreement.

EFFECT ON BIOTIES CURRENT ORGANIZATION

 

Biotie is headquartered in Turku, Finland, with a subsidiary based in South
San Francisco, California. Following the close of the acquisition, Acorda
plans to maintain the operations of the South San Francisco in full,
including the staff at that site. The future of Bioties location in Turku
will be considered separately later on. With this addition, Acorda will have
operations in three major U.S. biotechnology centers: New York, Boston and
San Francisco.
