Section 2.7. _Tax Free Reorganization Matters_. The parties hereto intend
that, for United States federal income tax purposes, the Mergers, will
constitute an integrated plan described in Rev. Rul. 2001-46, 2001-2 C.B. 321
that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations to which each of Acquiror and the
Company are to be parties under Section 368(b) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations and this Agreement is intended to be, and is adopted as, a plan
of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and the 368 of the Code
and within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g). The
parties hereto further intend that as a result of the Domestication the
Acquiror will be treated as a "domestic" corporation (within the meaning of
Section 7701(a)(4) of the Code and corresponding provisions of state and
local Law) prior to the First Effective Time. None of the parties hereto knows
of any fact or circumstance (without conducting independent inquiry or
diligence of the other relevant party), or has taken or will take any action,
if such fact, circumstance or action would be reasonably expected to cause
the Mergers, taken together, to fail to qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. The
Mergers, taken together, and the Domestication, shall be reported by the
parties hereto for all Tax purposes in accordance with the foregoing, unless
otherwise required by a Governmental Authority as a result of a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. The parties
hereto shall cooperate with each other and their respective counsel to
document and support the Tax treatment of the Mergers as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, including
providing factual support letters.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Acquiror shall appoint an exchange agent (the
" _Exchange Agent_ ") to act as the agent for the purpose of paying the
Aggregate Merger Consideration to the Company's stockholders. At or before the
First Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) a
cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Cash
Consideration, and (ii) the number of shares of Acquiror Class B Common Stock
equal to the Stock Consideration.

  



  

(b) Reasonably promptly after the First Effective Time, Acquiror shall
send or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder
of shares of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, whose Company Common Stock was converted pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)_ into the right to receive a portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and the risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper transfer of each share to the Exchange Agent, and
which letter of transmittal will be in customary form and have such
other provisions as Acquiror may reasonably specify) for use in such exchange
(each, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ").

  



  

(c) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive a portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration, pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, shall be entitled to receive
such portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, upon receipt of an

transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), together with a duly
completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents
as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent. No interest shall be
paid or accrued upon the transfer of any share.

  



  

   

 | 33| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Each holder of record of shares of Company Existing Common Stock
(not including the Excluded Shares) (each, a " _Holder_ ") shall have the
right, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article III_, to submit
an Election in accordance with this _Section 3.2(d)_ on or prior to the
Election Deadline. The Company shall not waive the Election Deadline
unless such Election Deadline is waived with respect to all Holders, the new
election deadline is disclosed by the Company to all Holders on a date agreed
to by Acquiror, and Acquiror has otherwise given its prior written consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to such waiver. "
_Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date which the
parties shall agree is as near as practicable to two (2) Business Days
preceding the Closing Date. The parties shall cooperate to inform each Holder
of the selected date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15)
Business Days before, and at least five (5) Business Days prior to, the
Election Deadline.

  



  

(i) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 3.2(d)(i)_ (an " _Election_ ") whether such
Holder desires to make a (i) Mixed Election, (ii) Cash Election or (iii) Stock
Election, in each case with respect to all the shares of Company Existing
Common Stock held by such Holder, and, in the case of a Mixed Election,
the Mixed Election Percentage desired by such Holder. An Election made by any
Holder shall apply to all shares of Company Existing Common Stock held by
such Holder. If any Holder attempts to apply an Election to only a portion of
such Holder's shares of Company Existing Common Stock, the portion of such
Holder's shares of Company Existing Common Stock with respect to which such
Holder did not attempt to make an Election shall be automatically treated as
if such Holder made a Mixed Election with a Mixed Election Percentage equal
to the Actual Cash/Stock Ratio.

  



  

(ii) Acquiror shall prepare a form of election that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Form of Election_ "), which shall include
the transmittal materials contemplated by _Section 3.2(b)_ , and Acquiror
shall mail, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail and deliver, together
with the Proxy Statement/Information Statement/Registration Statement, the
Form of Election to Holders as of the record date established by the Board of
Directors of the Company, in consultation with Acquiror, for purposes of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval by written consent (the " _Company
Record Date_ ") not less than 10 Business Days prior to the anticipated
Election Deadline (the period between such mailing and the Election Deadline,
the " _Election Period_ "). Acquiror shall use reasonable best efforts to
make available one or more Forms of Election as may reasonably be requested
from time to time by all persons who become Holders during the period
following the Company Record Date and prior to the Election Deadline.

  



  

(iii) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange
Agent shall have received, by the Election Deadline, (A) a Form of Election
properly completed and signed in accordance with the instructions therein, and
(B) the properly completed and executed documents required to be delivered by
such Holder pursuant to the other provisions of this _Section 3.2_.
Any Holder that does not make a valid Election by the Election Deadline shall
be deemed to have made a Mixed Election with a Mixed Election Percentage
equal to the Actual Cash/Stock Ratio.

(iv) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke
his, her or its Election by written notice to the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline, together with a properly completed and signed revised Form
of Election. Any subsequent transfer of such Holder's shares of Company
Existing Common Stock after such Holder has made an Election shall
automatically revoke such Election (and such subsequent transferee may make a
new Election pursuant to and if permitted by the terms of this _Section
3.2(d)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange
Agent of written notification from the Company or Acquiror that this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with  _Article X_. The Exchange Agent
shall have reasonable discretion to determine if any Election is not properly
made, changed or revoked with respect to any shares of Company Existing
Common Stock (none of the Company, Acquiror, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent
being under any duty to notify any Holder of any applicable defect). In the
event the Exchange Agent makes a reasonable determination that an Election
was not properly made (including as a result of the Exchange Agent not
receiving an Election by the Election Deadline), such Election shall be
deemed to be ineffective, and the shares of Company Existing Common Stock
covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Mixed
Consideration Shares with a Mixed Election Percentage equal to the Actual
Cash/Stock Ratio.

  



  

(e) Promptly following the date that is one (1) year after the First
Effective Time, Acquiror shall instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver to
Acquiror all documents in its possession relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and the Exchange Agent's duties shall terminate.
Thereafter, any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration that remains
unclaimed shall be returned to Acquiror, and any Person that was a holder of
shares of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the First Effective
Time that has not exchanged such shares of Company Common Stock for an
applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with
this _Section 3.2_ prior to the date that is one (1) year after the First
Effective Time, may transfer such shares of Company Common Stock to Acquiror
and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws)
receive in consideration therefor, and Acquiror shall promptly deliver, such
applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration without any interest
thereupon. None of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company, the First-Step Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable
to any Person in respect of any of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to and in accordance with any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If any such shares
shall not have not been transferred immediately prior to such date on which
any amounts payable pursuant to this _Article III_ would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such amounts
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) In the event that the Company or Acquiror changes the number of
shares of Company Common Stock, Acquiror Common Stock, shares of
capital stock of the Company, shares of capital stock of Acquiror or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Company Common Stock, Acquiror Common Stock, shares of capital stock of the
Company or shares of capital stock of Acquiror, as applicable, issued and
outstanding prior to the First Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, subdivision, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
other similar transaction (other than the Pre-Closing Restructuring, the
Domestication, the Total PIPE Investment and any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements), then any number
or amount contained herein which is based upon the price of Acquiror Common
Stock, or the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock or Company Common
Stock, as the case may be, the Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration,
the Mixed Election Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall
be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this _Section 3.2(f)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any
party hereto to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or
permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

(g) Unless the holder of Company Common Stock makes an express
designation to the contrary in its Letter of Transmittal provided in
accordance with _Section 3.2(b)_ , for purposes of this Agreement and in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.358-2(a)(2)(ii), the cash that
the holder of Company Common Stock is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)_ and _Section 3.1(b)_  shall be treated as received for its Company
Common Stock exchanged in the First Merger in the following order of priority:
(i) first, to the Company Common Stock held by such holder for more than one
(1) year before the First Merger within the meaning of Section 1223 of the
Code, if any, allocated first to such Company Common Stock with the highest
federal income tax basis and then in descending tax basis order until such
cash portion for such holder has been fully allocated, and (ii) any remaining
amount to all other Company Common Stock held by such holder, allocated first
to such Company Common Stock with the highest federal income tax basis and
then in descending tax basis order until such cash portion for such holder has
been fully allocated. For the avoidance of doubt, the designation of the
order in which a holder of Company Common Stock receives its allocable cash
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration shall not change the timing or
amount of the Aggregate Merger Consideration that any holder of Company
Common Stock is entitled to receive under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.3. _Treatment of Options, Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted
Stock Unit Awards_.

  



  

(a) As of the First Effective Time, the Company shall take all
necessary and appropriate actions so that, as of the First Effective
Time, each Option that is then outstanding shall be converted into the right
to receive an option relating to shares of Acquiror Class B Common Stock upon
the same terms and conditions as are in effect with respect to such option
immediately prior to the First Effective Time, including with respect to
vesting and termination-related provisions (each, an " _Acquiror Option_ ")
except that (i) such Acquiror Option shall relate to that whole number of
shares of Acquiror Class B Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) equal to the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Option,
_multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the exercise price per share for
each such Acquiror Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of
such Option in effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time, _divided
by_ the Exchange Ratio (the exercise price per share, as so determined, being
rounded up to the nearest full cent); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
conversion of the Options will be made in a manner consistent with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.424-1, such that such conversion will not constitute a
"modification" of such Options for purposes of Section 409A or Section 424 of
the Code.

  



  

   

 | 36| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) As of the First Effective Time, each unvested Restricted Stock
Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall
be converted into the right to receive restricted shares of Acquiror Class B
Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Restricted Stock Award_ ") with
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the First Effective Time
(including with respect to vesting and termination-related provisions),
except that such Adjusted Restricted Stock Award shall relate to such number
of shares of Acquiror Class B Common Stock as is equal to the product of (i)
the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Restricted Stock Award
immediately prior to the First Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (ii) the
Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole
share. The parties hereto intend that the Acquiror Class B Common Stock
payable pursuant to this _Section 3.3(b)_ to the holders of Company Common
Stock (but only with respect to their Company Common Stock which was fully
vested upon receipt or for which they have filed timely and valid elections
under Section 83(b) of the Code) will be treated as received in exchange
for the applicable holder's Company Common Stock, and intend to report for
income Tax purposes such payments as consideration for such holder\'s Company
Common Stock and not as compensation for services. Pursuant to Revenue Ruling
2007-49, the holders of Company Common Stock that receive Acquiror Class B
Common Stock in the First Merger pursuant to this _Section 3.3(b)_ that are
subject to vesting arrangements will make a timely and valid election under
Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to such Acquiror Class B Common Stock,
in which case, the parties hereto intend that no compensation will occur when
such Acquirer Class B Common Stock is issued or vests.

  



  

(c) As of the First Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Unit Award
that is outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive restricted stock units based on shares of
Acquiror Class B Common Stock (each, an  " _Adjusted Restricted Stock Unit
Award_ ") with substantially the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to such Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the First
Effective Time (including with respect to vesting and termination-
related provisions), except that such Adjusted Restricted Stock Unit Award
shall relate to such number of shares of Acquiror Class B Common Stock as is
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional
shares rounded down to the nearest whole share.

  



  

(d) The Company shall take all necessary actions to effect the
treatment of Options, Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock
Unit Awards pursuant to _Sections 3.3(a)_, _3.3(b)_ and _3.3(c)_ in
accordance with the Company Incentive Plan and the applicable award
agreements.

  



  

Section 3.4. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision to this
Agreement, Acquiror, the Company and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this
Agreement any such Taxes as may be required to be deducted and withheld from
such amounts under the Code or any other applicable Law (as reasonably
determined by Acquiror, the Company, and the Exchange Agent, respectively).
To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to the
applicable Governmental Authority, such deducted and withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.5. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time and held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented
thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand and has properly exercised
appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(such shares of Company Common Stock being referred to collectively as the "
_Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws, or loses such holder's appraisal rights under
the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to
receive a portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, but instead shall be
entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that if, after the First Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect, waives, withdraws, or loses such holder's right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL such shares of Company Common Stock shall
be treated as if they had been converted as of the First Effective Time into
the right to receive the Cash Election Consideration in accordance with
_Section 3.1_ without interest thereon, upon transfer of such shares. The
Company shall provide Acquiror prompt written notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any waiver or
withdrawal of any such demand, and any other demand, notice, or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the First Effective Time that relates to
such demand. Except with the prior written consent of Acquiror (which consent
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld, delayed or denied), the
Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to
settle, any such demands.

transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) applicable requirements of

Letter, (i) each Company Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in
material compliance with its terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA
and the Code; (ii) all contributions required to be made with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan on or before the date hereof have been made and all

have been accrued and reflected in the Company's financial statements to the
extent required by GAAP; (iii) each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to
be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS as to its qualification
or may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype plan and, to the knowledge
of the Company, no fact or event has occurred that would reasonably be

Company, any other "fiduciary" (as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) has any
liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply

extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other than
(i) coverage mandated by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits under any
"pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the

(f) Except as set forth on Section 4.13(f) of the Company Disclosure

benefits payable or to be provided by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, (ii) accelerate the
time of payment, funding or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation or
benefits due any such employee, officer or other individual service provider
by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, or (iii) accelerate the vesting

contemplated hereby will not, either alone or in combination with
another event, result in any "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of
the Code to any employee, officer or other individual service provider of the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company. No Company Benefit Plan provides for a
Tax gross-up, make whole or similar payment with respect to the Taxes imposed

the Code or Section 422 of the Code, if applicable. Each Option is intended to
either qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code
or to be exempt under Section 409A of the Code. The Company has made
available to Acquiror, accurate and complete copies of (i) the Company
Incentive Plan, (ii) the forms of standard award agreement under the Company
Incentive Plan, (iii) copies of any award agreements that materially

based awards granted under any Company Incentive Plan, together with the
material terms thereof (including but not limited to grant date, exercise

violate the terms of the Company Incentive Plan or any Contract governing the
terms of such awards.

any jurisdiction outside the United States, (i) all employer contributions to
each such Company Benefit Plan required by Law or by the terms of such Company
Benefit Plan have been made, (ii) each such Company Benefit Plan required to

or fully insured, is fully funded or fully insured, including any back-
service obligations, on an ongoing and termination or solvency basis
(determined using reasonable actuarial assumptions) in compliance with

and other fees being held in the Trust Account), such monies invested in
United States government securities or money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
pursuant to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of April
21, 2020, between Acquiror and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as
trustee (the " _Trustee_ ") (the " _Trust Agreement_ "). There are no
separate Contracts, side letters or other arrangements or understandings
(whether written or unwritten, express or implied) that would cause the
description of the Trust Agreement in the Acquiror SEC Filings to be
inaccurate or that would entitle any Person (other than shareholders of
Acquiror holding Acquiror Common Shares sold in Acquiror's initial public
offering who shall have elected to redeem their shares of Acquiror Common
Stock pursuant to Acquiror's Governing Documents and the underwriters of
Acquiror's initial public offering with respect to deferred underwriting
commissions) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to
the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may be released other
than to pay Taxes and payments with respect to all Acquiror Share
Redemptions. There are no claims or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge
of Acquiror, threatened with respect to the Trust Account. Acquiror has
performed all material obligations required to be performed by it to date
under, and is not in default, breach or delinquent in performance or any other
respect (claimed or actual) in connection with, the Trust Agreement, and no
event has occurred which, with due notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute such a default or breach thereunder. Since April 24, 2020,
Acquiror has not released any money from the Trust Account (other than
interest income earned on the principal held in the Trust Account as permitted
by the Trust Agreement). As of the First Effective Time, the obligations of

hereof, following the First Effective Time, no Acquiror Shareholder shall be
entitled to receive any amount from the Trust Account except to the extent
such Acquiror Shareholder is exercising an Acquiror Share Redemption. As
of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company contained herein and the compliance by the Company
with its obligations hereunder, neither Acquiror or Merger Sub have any reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust
Account will not be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not
be available to Acquiror and Merger Sub on the Closing Date. The Trust
Agreement has not been terminated, repudiated, rescinded, amended or
supplemented or modified, in any respect, and, to the knowledge of Acquiror,
no such termination, repudiation, rescission, amendment, supplement or

(e) On or prior to the date of this Agreement, Acquiror has entered
into Subscription Agreements, in substantially the form attached to Section
5.12(e) of the Acquiror Disclosure Letter, with PIPE Investors pursuant to
which, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, such PIPE
Investors have agreed to purchase, in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, from Acquiror shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A
Common Stock for a PIPE Investment Amount of $245,000,000 (such amount, the "
_Minimum PIPE Investment Amount_ "). Such Subscription Agreements are in full
force and effect with respect to, and binding on, Acquiror and, to the
knowledge of Acquiror, on each PIPE Investor party thereto, in accordance with
their terms. To the knowledge of Acquiror with respect to each PIPE Investor,
such Subscription Agreements have not been withdrawn or terminated, or
otherwise amended or modified, in any respect, and no withdrawal, termination,
amendment or modification is contemplated by Acquiror, except for such
assignments or transfers contemplated or permitted by the Subscription
Agreements and except for such actions permitted by _Section 7.11(a)_. Each
such Subscription Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of (x)
Acquiror and, (y) to the knowledge of Acquiror, each PIPE Investor party
thereto, in each case, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
by the other parties thereto, and neither the execution or delivery of such
Subscription Agreement by Acquiror nor the performance by Acquiror of its
obligations under any such Subscription Agreement violates or conflicts with
any applicable Laws or the Governing Documents of Acquiror. There are no other
agreements, side letters or arrangements between Acquiror and any PIPE
Investor relating to any such Subscription Agreement that would adversely
affect the obligation of such PIPE Investor to purchase from Acquiror the
applicable portion of the PIPE Investment Amount set forth in such
Subscription Agreement of such PIPE Investors and, as of the date hereof,
Acquiror does not have actual knowledge of any facts or circumstances that
would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in
any such Subscription Agreement not being satisfied, or the Minimum PIPE
Investment Amount not being available to Acquiror, on the Closing Date. No
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Acquiror under any material term
or condition of any such Subscription Agreement and, as of the date hereof,
Acquiror has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy in all
material respects on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be
satisfied by it contained in any such Subscription Agreement. Such
Subscription Agreements contain all of the conditions precedent (other than
the conditions contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, as
applicable) to the obligations of the PIPE Investors to contribute to Acquiror
the applicable portion of the PIPE Investment Amount set forth in such
Subscription Agreements on the terms therein. No fees, cash consideration or
other discounts are payable or have been agreed to be paid by Acquiror or any
of its Subsidiaries (including, from and after the Closing, the Company and
its Subsidiaries) to any PIPE Investor in respect of its PIPE Investment,
except as set forth in the Subscription Agreements. Following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Mergers
and the PIPE Investment), no PIPE Investor or stockholder of Acquiror as of
immediately prior to the First Merger or any of their respective Affiliates
will own ten percent (10%) or more of the outstanding capital stock (on a
fully diluted basis) of the Surviving Corporation.

any other Person.

are there any facts or circumstances, that would reasonably be expected to

commitment, or Governmental Order binding upon Acquiror or Merger Sub or to

Sub or the conduct of business by Acquiror or Merger Sub as currently
conducted or as contemplated to be conducted as of the Closing, other than

ARTICLE VII 
  
  _COVENANTS OF ACQUIROR_

  



  

Section 7.1. _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Employee Matters_. Acquiror shall take all necessary actions to
cause each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing to continue in employment with Acquiror and
its Affiliates (including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) immediately
following the Closing (such employees, the " _Continuing Employees_ ").
Following the Closing, Acquiror shall honor and perform in accordance with
their terms all Company Benefit Plans, including all employment, severance,
bonus, transaction, incentive and other compensation arrangements.

  



  

(b) _Continuing Compensation / Benefits_. Except where applicable Law
or the provisions of a Contract in effect as of the date hereof require more
favorable treatment, for the twelve (12) month period commencing on the
Closing Date, Acquiror and its Affiliates shall provide, or shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to provide, to each Continuing Employee with (i)
a base salary or regular hourly wage, as applicable, that is not less than
the base salary or regular hourly wage, as applicable, provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) annual
cash target bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than the annual
cash target bonus opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) employee benefits (excluding
equity awards, defined benefit pension or retiree medical benefits, as
applicable, except as required by applicable Law or the provisions of a
Contract) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate as those
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

(c) _Service Credit, Etc._ Effective as of the Closing and thereafter,
Acquiror and its Affiliates shall recognize, or shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to recognize, each Continuing Employee's employment or
service with the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries (including any
current or former Affiliate thereof or any predecessor of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) prior to the Closing for all purposes, including for
purposes of determining, as applicable, eligibility for participation, vesting
and entitlement of the Continuing Employee under all employee benefit plans
maintained by the Company, its Subsidiaries, Acquiror or an Affiliate of
Acquiror, including vacation plans or arrangements, 401(k) or other retirement
plans and any welfare plans (excluding equity incentive plans or benefit
accruals under a defined benefit pension plan), except to the extent such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, effective as of the Closing
and thereafter, Acquiror and its Affiliates shall, or shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations, eligibility waiting periods, actively at work requirements,
evidence of insurability requirements or required physical examinations under
any health or similar plan of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Acquiror or an
Affiliate of Acquiror to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents ( _provided_ , that, in the case of any
insured arrangements, subject to the consent of the applicable insurer and
Acquiror's commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent), except to
the extent that any waiting period, exclusions or requirements still applied
to such Continuing Employee under the comparable Company Benefit Plan in
which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Closing,
and (ii) fully credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible payments,
co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under the medical,
dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plans of the Company or any of the
Company's Subsidiaries prior to the Closing during the plan year in which the
Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which such
Continuing Employee has satisfied the deductible, co-payments, or maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for such plan year under any medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefit plan of the Company, its Subsidiaries,
Acquiror or an Affiliate of Acquiror, as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such plan (provided, that, in the case of any insured
arrangements, subject to the consent of the applicable insurer and Acquiror's
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent).

  



  

   

 | 83|

Plan in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (the " _ESPP_
"), and a Management Incentive Plan, the general terms and conditions of
which have been approved by the Company's Board of Directors and are set forth
on _Exhibit G_ (the " _Management Incentive Plan_ "). Within two (2)
Business Days following the expiration of the sixty (60) day period following
the date Acquiror has filed current Form 10 information with the SEC
reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company, Acquiror
shall file an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or other
applicable form) with respect to the Acquiror Class A Common Stock issuable
under the Incentive Equity Plan and the ESPP, and Acquiror shall
use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement(s) (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as awards granted pursuant to
the Incentive Equity Plan and the ESPP remain outstanding. Acquiror shall
grant equity awards for shares of Acquiror Class B Common Stock to such
persons and in the amounts and on the dates set forth on _Exhibit G_ ,
pursuant to the Management Incentive Plan.

the contrary, each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees
that all provisions contained in this _Section 7.1_ are included for the sole
benefit of Acquiror and the Company, and that nothing in this Agreement,

participant in any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan,
agreement or other arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof)),
any right to continued or resumed employment or recall, any right to
compensation or benefits, or any third-party beneficiary or other right of

Closing.

IX_ and provision of notice thereof to the Trustee (which notice Acquiror
shall provide to the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Trust
Agreement), (i) in accordance with and pursuant to the Trust Agreement, at
the Closing, Acquiror (A) shall cause any documents, opinions and notices
required to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement to be

amounts then available in the Trust Account to Acquiror for immediate use,
subject to this Agreement and the Trust Agreement and (ii) thereafter, the

mutually agreed by Acquiror and the Company at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the initial filing of the Proxy Statement/Information
Statement/Registration Statement with the SEC pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_,
Acquiror will delist the Acquiror Class A Common Stock from the NYSE and
instead prepare and submit to Nasdaq Capital Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") a listing

Section 7.9. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the First Effective Time, Acquiror agrees that it
shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of the (x) Company and each of its Subsidiaries (in each case, solely
to the extent acting in their capacity as such and to the extent such
activities are related to the business of the Company being acquired under
this Agreement) (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") and (y) Acquiror and
each of its Subsidiaries (together with the Company Indemnified Parties, the
" _D andO Indemnified Parties_") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the First Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the First Effective Time, to
the fullest extent that the Company, Acquiror or their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted under applicable
Law and its respective certificate of incorporation, certificate of
formation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement or other organizational
documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such DandO
Indemnified Parties (including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the
foregoing, Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (i) maintain
for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Second Effective Time
provisions in its Governing Documents concerning the indemnification and
exoneration (including provisions relating to expense advancement) of
Acquiror's and its Subsidiaries' former and current officers, directors,
employees, and agents that are no less favorable to those Persons than the
provisions of the Governing Documents of the Company, Acquiror or their
respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, in each case, as of the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in
any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons
thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law. Acquiror shall
assume, and be liable for, each of the covenants in this _Section 7.9_.

  



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the First Effective Time,
Acquiror shall maintain in effect directors' and officers' liability
insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by Acquiror's, the
Company's or their respective Subsidiaries' directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies (true, correct and complete copies of which have
been heretofore made available to Acquiror or its agents or representatives)
on terms no less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage,
except that in no event shall Acquiror be required to pay an annual premium
for such insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate
annual premium payable by Acquiror or the Company, as applicable (whichever
premium being higher), for such insurance policy for the year ended December
31, 2019; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Acquiror may cause coverage to be
extended under the current directors' and officers' liability insurance by
obtaining a six (6) year "tail" policy containing terms not materially less
favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage with respect to
claims existing or occurring at or prior to the First Effective Time and (ii)
if any claim is asserted or made within such six (6) year period, any
insurance required to be maintained under this _Section 7.9_ shall be
continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, this _Section 7.9_ shall survive the consummation of the
Mergers indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on Acquiror
and all successors and assigns of Acquiror. In the event that Acquiror or any
of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Acquiror shall ensure that proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Acquiror shall succeed to the obligations set forth
in this _Section 7.9_.

  



  

(d) On the Closing Date, Acquiror shall enter into customary
indemnification agreements reasonably satisfactory to each of the Company and
Acquiror with the post-Closing directors and officers of Acquiror, which
indemnification agreements shall continue to be effective following the
Closing.

  



  

Section 7.10. _Acquiror Public Filings_. From the date hereof through the
First Effective Time, Acquiror will keep current and timely file all
reports required to be filed or furnished with the SEC and otherwise comply
in all material respects with its reporting obligations under applicable
Laws.

  



  

Section 7.11. _PIPE Investment_.

  



  

(a) Unless otherwise approved in writing by the Company (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Acquiror shall
not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, any waiver (in whole
or in part) of, or provide consent to modify (including consent to
termination), any provision or remedy under, or any replacements of, any of
the Subscription Agreements, except for any such actions that would not
increase conditionality or impose any new obligation on the Company or
Acquiror, reduce the Minimum PIPE Investment Amount, reduce or impair the
rights of Acquiror under any Subscription Agreement or otherwise
adversely affect any rights of Acquiror or the Company under any Subscription
Agreement and except for any assignment or transfer contemplated in or
expressly permitted by any Subscription Agreement (without any further
amendment, modification or waiver to such assignment or transfer provision).
Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, Acquiror shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions
required, necessary or that it otherwise deems to be proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreements in
all material respects on the terms and conditions described
therein, including using its commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) satisfy
in all material respects on a timely basis all conditions and covenants
applicable to Acquiror in the Subscription Agreements and otherwise comply in
all material respects with its obligations thereunder; (ii) in the event that
all conditions in the Subscription Agreements (other than conditions that
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates control the satisfaction of and other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing) have been satisfied, consummate transactions contemplated by the
Subscription Agreements at or prior to Closing; and (iii) enforce its rights
under the Subscription Agreements, in the event that all conditions in the
Subscription Agreements (other than conditions that Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates control the satisfaction of and other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied, to
cause the applicable PIPE Investors to pay to (or as directed by)
Acquiror the applicable portion of the PIPE Investment Amount, as applicable,
set forth in the Subscription Agreements in accordance with their terms.

shall give the Company prompt written notice: (i) of any amendment to any
Subscription Agreement (other than as a result of any assignments or transfers
contemplated therein or otherwise permitted thereby) (ii) of any breach or
default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would give rise to any breach or default) by any party to any
Subscription Agreement known to Acquiror; (iii) of the receipt of any written
notice or other written communication from any party to any Subscription
Agreement with respect to any actual, potential, threatened or claimed
expiration, lapse, withdrawal, breach, default, termination or repudiation by
any party to any Subscription Agreement or any provisions of any Subscription
Agreement; and (iv) if Acquiror does not expect to receive all or any portion
of the Minimum PIPE Investment Amount pursuant to the Subscription Agreements.

ARTICLE XI 
  
  _MISCELLANEOUS_

is a blank check company with the powers and privileges to effect a Business
Combination. The Company further acknowledges that, as described in the
prospectus dated April 21, 2020 (the " _Prospectus_ ") available at
www.sec.gov, substantially all of Acquiror assets consist of the cash proceeds
of Acquiror's initial public offering and private placements of its
securities and substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in a
the trust account for the benefit of Acquiror, certain of its public
stockholders and the underwriters of Acquiror's initial public offering (the
" _Trust Account_ "). The Company acknowledges that it has been advised by
Acquiror that, except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in
the Trust Account that may be released to Acquiror to pay its franchise Tax,
income Tax and similar obligations, the Trust Agreement provides that cash in
the Trust Account may be disbursed only (a) if Acquiror completes the
transactions which constitute a Business Combination, then to those Persons
and in such amounts as described in the Prospectus; (b) if Acquiror fails to
complete a Business Combination within the allotted time period and
liquidates, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement, to Acquiror in
limited amounts to permit Acquiror to pay the costs and expenses of its
liquidation and dissolution, and then to Acquiror's public stockholders; and
(c) if Acquiror holds a shareholder vote to amend Acquiror's amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or
timing of the obligation to redeem 100% of Acquiror Common Shares if Acquiror
fails to complete a Business Combination within the allotted time period, then
for the redemption of any Acquiror Common Shares properly tendered in
connection with such vote. For and in consideration of Acquiror entering
into this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Company hereby irrevocably waives any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind they have or may have in the future in or to any
monies in the Trust Account and agree not to seek recourse against the Trust
Account or any funds distributed therefrom as a result of, or arising out of,
this Agreement and any negotiations, Contracts or agreements with Acquiror;
_provided_ , that (x) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the
Company's right to pursue a claim against Acquiror for legal relief against
monies or other assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific
performance or other equitable relief in connection with the consummation of
the transactions (including a claim for Acquiror to specifically perform its
obligations under this Agreement and cause the disbursement of the balance
of the cash remaining in the Trust Account (after giving effect to the
Acquiror Share Redemptions) to the Company in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Trust Agreement) so long as such claim would not affect
Acquiror's ability to fulfill its obligation to effectuate the Acquiror Share
Redemptions, or for fraud and (y) nothing herein shall serve to limit or
prohibit any claims that the Company may have in the future against
Acquiror's assets or funds that are not held in the Trust Account (including
any funds that have been released from the Trust Account and any assets that
have been purchased or acquired with any such funds).

the Company, on behalf of itself and the Skadden Waiving Parties, hereby
consents thereto and irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of
interest, breach of duty or any other objection arising from or relating to
Skadden's prior representation of the Sponsor, Acquiror and its Subsidiaries,
or other Skadden Waiving Parties. Each of Acquiror and the Company, for itself
and the Skadden Waiving Parties, hereby further irrevocably acknowledges and
agrees that all privileged communications, written or oral, between the
Sponsor, Acquiror, or its Subsidiaries, or any other member of the Skadden WP
Group, on the one hand, and Skadden, on the other hand, made prior to the
Closing, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery
and performance under, or any dispute or Action arising out of or relating
to, this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, or any matter relating to any of the foregoing, are
privileged communications that do not pass to the Surviving Corporation
notwithstanding the Mergers, and instead survive, remain with and are
controlled by the Skadden WP Group (the " _Skadden Privileged Communications_
"), without any waiver thereof. Acquiror and the Company, together with any
of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, agree
that no Person may use or rely on any of the Skadden Privileged
Communications, whether located in the records or email server of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, in any Action against or involving
any of the parties after the Closing, and Acquiror and the Company agree not
to assert that any privilege has been waived as to the Skadden Privileged
Communications, by virtue of the Mergers.
