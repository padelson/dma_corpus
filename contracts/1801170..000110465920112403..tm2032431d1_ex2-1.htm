or prior to the date of this Agreement, Acquiror has entered into Subscription Agreements, in substantially the form attached to
Section&nbsp;5.12(e) of the Acquiror Disclosure Letter, with PIPE Investors pursuant to which, and on the terms and subject to
the conditions of which, such PIPE Investors have agreed to purchase, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
from Acquiror shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class&nbsp;A Common Stock for a PIPE Investment Amount of $245,000,000 (such amount,
the &ldquo;<U>Minimum PIPE Investment Amount</U>&rdquo;). Such Subscription Agreements are in full force and effect with respect
to, and binding on, Acquiror and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, on each PIPE Investor party thereto, in accordance with their terms.
To the knowledge of Acquiror with respect to each PIPE Investor, such Subscription Agreements have not been withdrawn or terminated,
or otherwise amended or modified, in any respect, and no withdrawal, termination, amendment or modification is contemplated by
Acquiror, except for such assignments or transfers contemplated or permitted by the Subscription Agreements and except for such
actions permitted by <U>Section&nbsp;7.11(a)</U>. Each such Subscription Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
(x)&nbsp;Acquiror and, (y)&nbsp;to the knowledge of Acquiror, each PIPE Investor party thereto, in each case, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, and neither the execution or delivery of such Subscription
Agreement by Acquiror nor the performance by Acquiror of its obligations under any such Subscription Agreement violates or conflicts
with any applicable Laws or the Governing Documents of Acquiror. There are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements between
Acquiror and any PIPE Investor relating to any such Subscription Agreement that would adversely affect the obligation of such PIPE
Investor to purchase from Acquiror the applicable portion of the PIPE Investment Amount set forth in such Subscription Agreement
of such PIPE Investors and, as of the date hereof, Acquiror does not have actual knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in any such Subscription Agreement not being satisfied, or
the Minimum PIPE Investment Amount not being available to Acquiror, on the Closing Date. No event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Acquiror under any material term or condition
of any such Subscription Agreement and, as of the date hereof, Acquiror has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy
in all material respects on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in any such Subscription
Agreement. Such Subscription Agreements contain all of the conditions precedent (other than the conditions contained in this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements, as applicable) to the obligations of the PIPE Investors to contribute to Acquiror the applicable
portion of the PIPE Investment Amount set forth in such Subscription Agreements on the terms therein. No fees, cash consideration
or other discounts are payable or have been agreed to be paid by Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries (including, from and after
the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to any PIPE Investor in respect of its PIPE Investment, except as set forth in the
Subscription Agreements. Following the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Mergers and the PIPE
Investment), no PIPE Investor or stockholder of Acquiror as of immediately prior to the First Merger or any of their respective
Affiliates will own ten percent (10%) or more of the outstanding capital stock (on a fully diluted basis) of the Surviving Corporation.</P>
