shall be cancelled and retired, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto;   (b) each share of common stock, no par value per share, of Merger
Co. ("Merger Co. Common Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock,
no par value per share (the "Surviving Corporation Common Stock"), of the
Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted;   (c) each Common Share outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(a)
and Section 2.02(g), be converted into the right to receive from Parent a
number of fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common Shares equal to the Per
Share Ratio (the "Common Exchange Ratio") (together with any cash paid in
respect of fractional shares, the "Common Merger Consideration");   (d)
each share (each a "Series A Preferred Share") of Series A Preferred Stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Series A Preferred Stock")
outstanding   15    immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(g), be converted into the right
to receive from Parent a number of shares of fully paid and nonassessable

of Common Shares into which such Series A Preferred Share is convertible as
of the Effective Time (the "Series A Preferred Exchange Ratio") (together
with any cash paid in respect of fractional shares, the "Series A Preferred
Merger Consideration");   (e) each share (each a "Series B Preferred Share")
of Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
"Series B Preferred Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(g), be converted
into the right to receive from Parent a number of shares of fully paid and
nonassessable Parent Common Shares equal to the Per Share Ratio, multiplied
by the number of Common Shares into which such Series B Preferred Share is
convertible as of the Effective Time (the "Series B Preferred Exchange
Ratio") (together with any cash paid in respect of fractional shares, the
"Series B Preferred Merger Consideration"); and   (f) each share (each a
"Series C Preferred Share" and together with the Common Shares, the Series A
Preferred Shares and the Series B Preferred Shares, the "Shares") of Series C
Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Series C
Preferred Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(g), be converted into the right
to receive from Parent a number of shares of fully paid and nonassessable
Parent Common Shares equal to the Per Share Ratio, multiplied by the number
of Common Shares into which such Series C Preferred Share is convertible as

with any cash paid in respect of fractional shares, the "Series C Preferred
Merger Consideration" and together with the Common Merger Consideration, the

Consideration, the "Merger Consideration").   (g) Notwithstanding anything

has not, as of the Effective Time, voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing, shall not be converted and retired pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this Section 2.02 at the Effective Time (such shares,
the "Remaining Shares"). From and after the Effective Time, each certificate
representing a Remaining Share shall represent solely the right to receive
the respective amounts set forth in this Section 2.02(g) and (i) if the
holder of any Remaining Share effectively dissents from the Merger and
perfects such holder\'s dissenter\'s rights pursuant to the procedure set
forth in Article 13 of the NCBCA on or prior to the Payment Demand Date (each
such share, a "Dissenting Share"), then such holder shall be entitled to
payment from the Surviving Corporation of the fair value of such
Dissenting Share in accordance with Article 13 of the NCBCA; provided that if
any such holder shall effectively withdraw or lose such rights, each
Dissenting Share held by such holder shall thereupon be converted into the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration issuable in respect of
such Remaining Share and retired in the manner set forth in the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.02 and (ii) each Remaining Share which does not
become a Dissenting Share on or prior to the Payment Demand Date, shall be
converted into the applicable Merger Consideration issuable in respect of
such Remaining Share and retired on the first Business Day following the
Payment Demand Date in the manner set forth in the foregoing provisions of
this Section 2.02. The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any
written notice of intent   16    to dissent and demand payment and
written demand for payment pursuant to Article 13 of the NCBCA and any
withdrawals of demands for payment and other related communications received
by the Company prior to the Closing Date, and (B) the opportunity to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for dissenter\'s rights or settle or
offer to settle any demand.   (h) No certificates or scrip representing less
than one Parent Common Share shall be issued in exchange for Shares upon the
surrender for exchange of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "Certificates"). In lieu
of any such fractional share, each holder of Shares who would otherwise have
been entitled to a fraction of a Parent Common Share upon surrender of
Certificates for exchange shall be paid upon such surrender (and after taking
into account all Certificates surrendered by such holder) cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the volume
weighted average of the per share selling price of one Parent Common Share on
the OTC Bulletin Board (or if the Parent Common Shares are not traded on the
OTC Bulletin Board, on the principal securities exchange, interdealer
quotation system or other securities market on which the Parent Common Shares
are then traded) for the ten consecutive trading days ending on the second
Business Day prior to the Effective Time, as reported by Bloomberg Financial
Markets (or such other source as W and Parent may agree); provided that if
the Parent Common Shares are so traded but the selling price thereof is not
reported, such fraction shall be multiplied by the average of the last
bid and ask prices for one Parent Common Share for such period of ten
consecutive trading days.   Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Parent
shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
certificates representing Shares for the Merger Consideration. Parent shall
cause Merger Co. to make available to the Exchange Agent, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration to be exchanged or paid in
respect of the Shares. The Surviving Corporation shall send, or shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Shares, at the same time that
the PPM is sent or given to such holders, (i) a letter of transmittal for use
in such exchange (which shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the certificates representing Shares to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions to effect the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration.   (b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Certificates representing such Shares,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal covering such
Shares, shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such Shares. The holder of such Certificate, upon its exchange for
Parent Common Shares, shall also receive any dividends or other distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.03(c). Certificates
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled following the Effective Time. Until
so surrendered, each such Certificate, following the Effective Time, shall
represent for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration.   17     (c) No dividends or other distributions declared
or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Shares with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Parent Common Shares such
holder is entitled to receive until the holder of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate in accordance with the provisions of this Section
2.03. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate,
there shall be paid to the record holder of the Certificates representing
whole Parent Common Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at
the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole Parent Common Shares.   (d) If any Certificate for Parent Common
Shares is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to
the issuance therefor that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
that the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of the issuance of a
Certificate for Parent Common Shares in any name other than that of the
registered holder of such Shares, or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Person" means an individual, a corporation, a limited
liability company, a partnership, an association, a trust or any other entity
or organization, including a government or political subdivision or any
agency or instrumentality thereof.   (e) After the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article 2.   (f) None of Parent, Merger Co., W or the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any holder of Shares for
any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (g) The Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to the Agreement to any holder of Shares, and from
any cash dividends or other distributions that the holder is entitled to
receive under Section 2.03(c), such amounts as the Exchange Agent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder ("Code"), or any provision of state, local or non-
United States tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Exchange Agent, such portion of the Merger Consideration and other
such amounts payable under Section 2.03(c) that are withheld shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been received by the holder of
the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Exchange Agent.   (h) Any portion of the Certificates evidencing the Parent
Common Shares, the cash to be paid in respect of fractional shares and the
cash or other property in respect of dividends or other distributions
supplied to the Exchange Agent which remains unclaimed by the holders of
Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand,   18    and any such holder who has not exchanged his Shares for
the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that
time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent
Common Shares.   Section 2.04. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In
the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions
as may be required pursuant to this Article 2; provided, however, that Parent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a
bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   Section
2.05. Stock Options and Warrants. Following the Effective Time, each option
to purchase Parent Common Shares (a "Parent Stock Option") outstanding as of
the Effective Time shall continue in effect in accordance with the terms and
conditions of each such Parent Stock Option. Except as set forth in Section
2.05 of the written disclosure schedule previously delivered by the Company
to Parent (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), at or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each stock option and warrant to purchase Shares or any other
capital stock of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries outstanding, whether
or not vested or exercisable, and each commitment or agreement to
issue Shares or any other capital stock of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries, including without limitation, all such stock options, warrants
and commitments or agreements to issue Shares or any other capital stock of
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries set forth in Section 4.05 and Section
4.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall be cancelled without the
payment of any consideration, and the Company and the Subsidiaries shall
obtain all consents and approvals necessary to effect such cancellation.  
Section 2.06. Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding Company Common Stock, Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Parent Common
Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or different
class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split
up, combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable
in any securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or
any similar event shall have occurred, the Common Exchange Ratio, Series A
Preferred Exchange Ratio, Series B Preferred Exchange Ratio, Series C
Preferred Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration, as the case may be,
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company
Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event.   ARTICLE 3   THE SURVIVING

the laws of the State of North Carolina, and has all corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified, individually or in the aggregate, has
not and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
(i) the condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets, liabilities or
results of operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
provided, however, that for purposes of this Agreement none of the following
shall be deemed to constitute, and none of the following shall be taken into
account in determining whether there has been, a Material Adverse Effect
unless, in each such case, any such item has a disproportionate effect on the
condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets, liabilities or results
of operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (a) any
adverse change, event, development or effect arising from or relating to (1)
general business or economic conditions, (2) national or international
political or social conditions, including the engagement by the United States
in hostilities, whether or not pursuant to the declaration of a national
emergency or war, or the occurrence of any military or terrorist attack, (3)

and any decline in the price of any security or any market index), (4)
changes in GAAP, or (5) changes in law, rules, relations, orders or other
binding directives issued by any governmental entity, (b) any adverse change
generally applicable to the telecommunications industry, or (c) any effect
arising from compliance by Parent, the Company or W with the terms
of this   20    Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements; or (ii)

necessary by shareholders of the Company required by law or otherwise in
order to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming this
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the other
parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the

action by or in respect of, consent or approval of, or filing with, any
governmental body, agency, official or authority other than (a) the filing of
articles of merger in accordance with North Carolina Law; (b) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust

actions, consents, approvals, filings and notifications, the failure of which
to make or obtain would not prevent or materially delay the Company from
performing its obligations under this Agreement, or that are otherwise
immaterial to the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and the
consummation of the Transactions.   21     Section 4.04. Non-

any Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets, (c)
constitute a default under or give rise to a right of termination,

administered substantially in accordance with its terms, and, in compliance
in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code
and other applicable laws, rules and regulations; (iii) no event has occurred

member of their "Controlled Group" (defined as any organization which is a
member of a controlled group of organizations within the meaning of Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code), to any Tax, fine, lien, penalty or

routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened and (ii) to the knowledge of
the Company, no facts or circumstances exist that would be reasonably likely
to give rise to any such actions, suits or claims in either case where such
actions, suits or claims would reasonably be expected to result in a material
unfunded liability to the Company or its Affiliates.   (e) Except as set
forth in Section 4.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no Company Plan
exists that, as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
Transactions (whether alone or in connection with any subsequent event(s)),

Employee of any money or other property, (ii) the provision of any benefits
or other rights to any Company Employee or (iii) the increase, acceleration
or provision of any payments, benefits or other rights to any Company
Employee, whether or not any such payment, right or benefit would constitute

condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets, liabilities or results
of operations of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
provided, however, that for purposes of this Agreement none of the following
shall be deemed to constitute, and none of the following shall be taken into

Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Parent
and Merger Co. and the other Transaction Agreements and the Warrants will

and thereto, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement
of Parent and Merger Co., and each of the other Transaction Agreements and
the Warrants when executed and delivered prior to the Effective Time will

discussion, or negotiations. For purposes of this Section 8.03, the term

Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than Parent or any
Parent Subsidiaries.   "Company Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or
proposal for a merger, reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, share

Agreement.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of
the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or
other intermediaries, may (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with any
Person that has made an unsolicited bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal
not resulting from or arising out of a breach of Section 8.03(a), (ii)
furnish to such Person nonpublic information relating to the Company or any

informational purposes only to Parent not later than the notice required
pursuant to Section 8.03(c) or, if executed after such notice, as promptly as
practicable after execution) and/or (iii) if prior to the Company shareholder
meeting or the taking of the written consent referred to in Section 8.01(b),
withdraw or modify or change in a manner adverse to Parent its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger and recommend a Superior

permitted to take an action described in any of the foregoing clauses (i),
(ii) or (iii) if, and only if, prior to taking such particular action, the
Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith by a majority
vote that (x) such Company Acquisition Proposal would result in, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, in the case of any
of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), or constitutes a Superior Proposal, in
the case of the foregoing clause (iii), and (y) the Board of Directors of
the Company (after considering the advice of outside legal counsel) is
required to take such particular action to comply with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law.   "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited bona fide
Company Acquisition Proposal to acquire all or substantially all of the
outstanding Shares or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company

66    Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with an independent nationally recognized financial
advisor, taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Company
Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation) are more favorable to the
Company\'s shareholders than this Agreement and the Merger, taken as a whole,
and that is reasonably capable of being completed (including with respect to
the need for and ability of such third party to obtain any external
financing). Reference to "this Agreement" and "the Merger" in this paragraph
shall be deemed to include any proposed alteration of the terms of this
Agreement or the Merger that are agreed to by Parent after it receives
written notice from the Company pursuant to Section 8.03(c) of the existence
of, the identity of the Person making, and the terms and conditions of, any
Company Acquisition Proposal.   (c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly
(but in any event within 24 hours) after receipt or occurrence of (i) any
Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information with respect
to any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any inquiry, proposal, discussions
or negotiation with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, and (iv) the
material terms and conditions of any such Company Acquisition Proposal,
request for information, inquiry, proposal, discussion or negotiation and the
identity of the Person making any such Company Acquisition Proposal, request
for information, inquiry or proposal or with whom discussions or negotiations
are taking place. In addition, the Company shall promptly (but in any event
within 24 hours) after the receipt thereof, provide to Parent copies of any
written documentation material to understanding such Company Acquisition
Proposal, request for information, inquiry, proposal, discussion or
negotiation ("Other Acquisition Documentation") which is received by the
Company from the Person (or from any representatives or agents of such
Person) making such Company Acquisition Proposal, request for information,
inquiry or proposal or with whom such discussions or negotiations are taking
place. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed of the status and details
(including any amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Company
Acquisition Proposal or request for information and keep Parent fully
informed as to the material details of any information requested of or
provided by the Company and as to the material details of all discussions or
negotiations with respect to any such Company Acquisition Proposal, request
for information, inquiry or proposal and shall provide to Parent within one
Business Day after receipt thereof all copies of any additional Other
Acquisition Documentation received by the Company from the Person (or from
any representatives or agents of such Person) making such Company Acquisition
Proposal, request for information, inquiry or proposal or with whom such
discussions or negotiations are taking place. The Company shall promptly
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company provided
to any other Person in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal that
was not previously provided to Parent. The Board of Directors of the Company
shall promptly consider in good faith (in consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) any proposed alteration of the terms of this
Agreement or the Merger proposed by Parent in response to any
Company Acquisition Proposal.   Section 8.04. Notices of Certain

Section 8.07. Reasonable Best Efforts.   69     (a) Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each party shall use its reasonable best

limiting the foregoing, each party and its Board of Directors shall use their
reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action necessary so that no state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (y) if any state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to any of the
foregoing, take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms

otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger
and the other Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, if required by the HSR Act or other Regulatory Law, each of

separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business in a specified
manner, or permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition of any

to obtain all requisite material approvals and authorizations for the
Transactions under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission in connection with any investigation
or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii)
promptly inform the other parties of any material communication received by
such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division of the

or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the Transactions, and (iii) permit the other parties to
review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or   70    conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or
any such other governmental entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ,
the FTC or such other applicable governmental entity or other Person, give
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences. For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other federal, state and
foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose
or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition.   (c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
in furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 8.07(a) and 8.07(b), if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any Transaction as
violative of any Regulatory Law, each of Parent, W and the Company shall
cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective reasonable
best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 8.07 shall limit a party\'s rights to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01.   (d) If any objections are asserted
with respect to the Transactions under any Regulatory Law or if any suit is
instituted by any governmental entity or any private party challenging any of
the Transactions as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of Parent, W and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such
objections or challenge as such governmental entity or private party may have
to such Transactions under such Regulatory Law so as to permit consummation
of the Transactions.   (e) Nothing in this Section 8.07 shall require Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary to agree to any material modification of any
material provision of the Parent Credit Agreement or any security agreement
related to the Parent Credit Agreement; provided that a material modification
shall not be deemed to include (i) the payment by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary of a customary consent or waiver fee under the Parent Credit
Agreement or (ii) the amendment of any terms and conditions in the Parent
Credit Agreement or of any security agreement related to the Parent Credit
Agreement that are consistent in all material respects with the commitment
letter attached hereto as Exhibit I.   (f) Nothing in this Section 8.07

modification of any material provision of the Company Credit Agreement (such
modification to be reflected in the new Company credit agreement to be
entered into upon termination of the Company Credit Agreement as referred to
in Section 9.01(g)) or any security agreement related to the Company Credit
Agreement; provided that a material modification shall not be deemed to
include (i) the payment by the Company or any Subsidiary of a customary
consent or waiver fee under the Company Credit Agreement or (ii) the
amendment of any terms and conditions of the new Company credit agreement
to be entered into after termination of the Company Credit Agreement as
referred to in Section 9.01(g) or of any   71    security agreement
related to such new Company credit agreement that are consistent in all
material respects with the commitment letter attached hereto as Exhibit
J.   Section 8.08. Public Announcements. On or prior to Closing, no
party hereto shall make any press release, public statement or public
announcement with respect to this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements
or the Transactions without the prior written consent of (i) Parent if such
press release, public statement or announcement is made by W or the Company,
(ii) Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe VIII, L.P., if the press release or
public statement or announcement is made by Parent, and (iii) the Company if
the press release or public statement or announcement is made by Parent;
provided, however, that each party hereto may make any press release, public
statement or public announcement which such party determines, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, is required by applicable law or
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or The NASDAQ
Stock Market, Inc., in which case, the party desiring to make such disclosure
or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the
other parties hereto prior to making such disclosure or announcement.
Following the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand,
and W, on the other hand, shall consult with each other prior to making any
press release, public statement or public announcement with respect to this
Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or the Transactions, provided
that any such press release, public statement or public announcement made by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation that includes the name of any WCAS
Securityholder shall require the prior consent of Welsh, Carson, Anderson and
Stowe VIII, L.P. (provided that if such press release, public statement or
public announcement is required by applicable law or any listing agreement
with any national securities exchange or The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc.,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall not be obligated to
obtain Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe VIII, L.P.\'s prior consent but
shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with Welsh, Carson, Anderson
and Stowe VIII, L.P. prior to making such disclosure or announcement). Nothing
in this Section 8.08 shall limit the ability of W or the Company, consistent
with their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreements, to
communicate with its partners, investors or shareholders (A) as required by
applicable law, (B) in the ordinary course of business or (C) in connection
with the approval and consummation of the Transactions.   Section 8.09.

such WCAS Securityholder and (y) deliver to the Company all releases,
instruments or other documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent
evidencing the release of any and all Liens securing such Indebtedness, and
(ii) Parent shall, in full satisfaction of such Indebtedness and release of

purposes of paying Transaction Expenses) shall be effected pursuant to the
issuance of promissory notes (the "Post-July 31 Notes") by the Company and
the Subsidiaries to W and its Affiliates. The Post-July 31 Notes shall
represent Indebtedness of the Company and the Subsidiaries incurred after
July 31, 2003 owing to W and its Affiliates and shall not provide for
any cash payments in respect of any principal or interest accrued thereon
other than subsequent to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with

of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title
and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the
Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger. Each of the parties hereto shall
execute and deliver such documents and other papers and take such further
action as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and to make effective the
Transactions.   Section 8.11. Confidentiality. The Confidentiality Agreement

together with the Company Confidentiality Agreement, the "Confidentiality
Agreements") shall continue in full force and effect prior to the Effective
Time and after any termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
the Confidentiality Agreements or the Transaction Agreements to the contrary,
any party to this Agreement (and any employee, representative, or other agent
of any party to this Agreement) may disclose to any and all Persons, without
limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the
Transactions and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax

any applicable federal or state securities laws.   Section 8.12. Obligations

agrees that it shall, indemnify and hold harmless the present and former
officers and directors of the Company in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted
by North Carolina Law or any other applicable laws and as provided under the
Company\'s articles of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof;
provided that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed
from time to time under applicable law.   (b) For six years after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide officers\' and
directors\' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by
the Company\'s officers\' and directors\' liability insurance policy on terms
with respect to coverage and in such amount that are no less favorable than
those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided that the
Surviving Corporation shall only be required to comply with this covenant if
it is able to procure such insurance policy for an aggregate amount that does
not exceed $900,000; provided further, that if the cost of such insurance
policy exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.   (c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.14.   (d)
The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 8.14 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the articles
of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the equivalent
organizational documents of any of the Subsidiaries, or under North Carolina
Law or any other applicable laws or under any agreement of any Indemnified
Person with the Company or any of the Subsidiaries. These rights shall
survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and the heirs and representatives of
such Indemnified Party.   Section 8.15. Employee Benefits. Subject to
Section 2.05, following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) honor all obligations under employment,
severance, change of control or similar agreements of the Company in
accordance with the terms thereof and (ii) pay all benefits accrued through
the Effective Time under employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements of the Company in accordance with the terms thereof. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent agrees to provide,
or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, employees of the Company
and   74    the Subsidiaries as of the Closing who are employees of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (including the Surviving Corporation and any
subsidiary thereof) on the date that is six months following the Closing Date
(the "Continuing Employees") with employee benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries, and such Continuing
Employees shall be given credit for all purposes (other than benefit accrual
under any defined benefit pension plan) under the terms of employee benefit
plans, policies, programs and arrangements of Parent in which such Continuing
Employees participate for all prior service with the Company and the
Subsidiaries to the same extent such service was recognized under similar
plans at the Company or the Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries shall honor all vacation,
personal and sick days accrued by Continuing Employees during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs (but not any days accrued in any
period prior to such calendar year) under the plans, policies, programs and
arrangements of the Company and the Subsidiaries in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time. In addition to the foregoing, for a period of six
months following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide severance and termination benefits to
each individual who is an employee of the Company and the Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which are no less favorable than the
severance and termination benefits such employee was entitled to receive
under the plans and arrangements of the Company and the Subsidiaries in
effect as of the date of this Agreement as described in Section 8.15 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. Furthermore, with respect to medical benefits
provided to Continuing Employees at or after the Effective Time under
Parent\'s medical benefit plans, Parent agrees that it shall, or it shall
cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, waive waiting periods and pre-existing
condition requirements under such plans (to the extent that such waiting
periods and conditions would not have applied under the terms of the similar
medical benefit plan of the Company), and will give Continuing Employees
credit for any co-payments and deductibles actually paid by such employees
under the medical plans of the Company and the Subsidiaries during the
calendar year in which the Continuing Employees first begin participation in
the medical plan(s) of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries. Nothing in this
Section 8.15 shall limit the Parent or the Surviving Corporation\'s right to
terminate the employment of any employee of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries (including any Continued Employees) at any time.   Section
8.16. Certificate of Designations. Prior to the Closing, (i) the Board of
Directors of Parent shall approve and adopt the certificate of designations

B Certificate of Designations to be filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.  
Section 8.17. Stockholders Meeting. No later than 30 days following the
Effective Time, Parent shall file with the SEC preliminary proxy materials to
be mailed to its stockholders in connection with an annual meeting of
its stockholders. As soon as reasonably practicable after Parent shall have
the right under SEC regulations to mail definitive proxy materials for such
annual meeting, Parent shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold such
annual meeting. At such meeting, Parent shall present to its stockholders for
adoption, and the Board of Directors of Parent shall recommend the adoption
of, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation in substantially the form
attached as Exhibit G hereto. Following such adoption,   75    Parent
shall immediately file such Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the law of the
State of Delaware.   Section 8.18. Reservation of Parent Common Shares. For
so long as any shares of the Parent Series B Preferred Stock or Warrants are
outstanding, Parent at all times shall reserve and keep available, free of
preemptive rights, solely for issuance and delivery upon conversion of the
Parent Series B Preferred Stock and exercise of the Warrants, the number of
Parent Common Shares from time to time issuable upon conversion of all of the
Parent Series B Preferred Stock and exercise of all of the Warrants at the
time outstanding.   Section 8.19. Incentive Plans. W shall cause the Company
to terminate each equity incentive plan (other than the Long-Term Incentive
Plan) maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary for the benefit of
employees and directors of the Company or any Subsidiary and all rights of
all persons under or related to such plans. The Company shall obtain all
consents and approvals necessary for such terminations and shall not pay any
consideration to obtain such consents.   Section 8.20. Portfolio Company
Actions. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i)
each WCAS Securityholder agrees that it shall use its reasonable best efforts
not to (and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates not
to) direct, encourage or facilitate the taking of any action by any portfolio
company of such WCAS Securityholder or Affiliate of such WCAS Securityholder
to the extent that such action would be prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement if taken directly by such WCAS Securityholder, and (ii) no
provision of this Agreement shall bind any portfolio company of any WCAS
Securityholder and, except as provided in clause (i) above, no WCAS
Securityholder shall be liable for any action taken by any such portfolio
company.   Section 8.21. Sale of Additional Shares of Parent Series B
Preferred Stock. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Section 8.21, pursuant to a Drawdown Notice delivered during the
Commitment Period, in addition to the shares of Parent Series B Preferred
Stock sold by Parent to the WCAS Securityholders pursuant to Article 2, and
provided that the Drawdown Conditions have then been satisfied, Parent may,
at its option, sell from time to time to the WCAS Securityholders, and the
WCAS Securityholders shall be required to purchase from Parent for cash, up
to a number of shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock equal to the
Specified Sale Amount for a purchase price per share equal to the Face
Amount.   (b) Drawdowns.   (i) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in  Section 8.21(c), on any Business Day during the
Commitment Period on which  the Drawdown Conditions have been satisfied or
waived by the WCAS  Securityholders, Parent may effect a Drawdown by the
delivery of a Drawdown  Notice to the WCAS Securityholders; provided that,
subject to the terms of  this Section 8.21, Parent may effect a Drawdown on
any Business Day after  expiration of the Commitment Period up to the
nineteen-month anniversary of  the Closing Date, so long as the Drawdown
Notice was delivered by Parent to  the WCAS Securityholders prior to the
expiration of the Commitment Period;   76     (ii) The aggregate number
of shares of Parent Series B Preferred  Stock subject to each Drawdown, as
specified in the corresponding Drawdown  Notice, shall not be less than the
Minimum Drawdown Amount.   (iii) The aggregate number of shares of Parent
Series B Preferred  Stock subject to each Drawdown, as specified in the
corresponding Drawdown  Notice, shall not exceed (A) the Specified Sale
Amount, minus (B) the  aggregate number of shares of Parent Series B
Preferred Stock previously  issued and sold pursuant to Drawdowns.   (c)
Drawdown Closings.   (i) Each closing of a Drawdown (a "Drawdown Closing")
shall take  place at the principal executive offices of Parent at 10:00 a.m.
on the  fifteenth day following the receipt by the WCAS Securityholders of
a  Drawdown Notice (or (x) if such day is not a Business Day, on the next 
succeeding Business Day and (y) if the conditions specified in Section 
8.21(c)(ii)(B)-(D) are not satisfied on such date, on the first Business  Day
on which such conditions are satisfied), or at such other place, time  or
date as shall be mutually agreed upon by Parent and the WCAS 
Securityholders; provided that (without the consent of the WCAS 
Securityholders) Parent may specify in such Drawdown Notice that the 
applicable Drawdown Closing shall take place on any Business Day following 
such fifteenth day through and including the first Business Day of the  first
quarterly period commencing after expiration of the quarterly period  in
which such fifteenth day occurs; provided, further, that if a Drawdown 
Closing takes place on the first Business Day of such subsequent quarterly 
period, and such Business Day is not the first day of such quarterly  period,
Parent may elect to treat the Drawdown Shares issued at such  Drawdown
Closing as having been issued on the first day of such quarterly  period.
Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 8.21(c)(i), no  Drawdown
Closing shall be effected after the date that is the  nineteen-month
anniversary of the Closing Date. The date of each Drawdown  Closing is
referred to herein as a "Drawdown Closing Date." Unless mutually  agreed by
Parent and the WCAS Securityholders, no Drawdown Closing Date  shall take
place earlier than the 30th day after a prior Drawdown Closing  Date.  
(ii) Each Drawdown Closing shall only be held if (A) Parent shall  have
represented and warranted (in a certificate signed by the President or  any
Vice President of Parent), as of the Drawdown Closing Date, to each  WCAS
Securityholder purchasing shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock in  such
Drawdown that such shares have been duly authorized and validly issued  and
are fully paid and nonassessable, free and clear of all Liens other  than as
set forth in the Governance Agreement and the issuance thereof is  not
subject to any preemptive or other similar right, (B) such Drawdown  would
not otherwise violate or cause the violation of, any applicable law, 
statute, ordinance rule or regulation, (C) any applicable waiting period 
under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated, and (D) no material

INDEMNIFICATION   Section 10.01. General Indemnification.   (a) Subject to
Sections 10.02 and 10.03, from and after the Closing, W hereby agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates (other than W
and its Affiliates), and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents (collectively, the "Parent Indemnified Parties") from
and against any and all losses, expenses (including attorneys\' fees
and expenses), damages, liabilities, fines, penalties, judgments, actions,
claims and costs (collectively, "Losses") incurred or suffered by the
Parent Indemnified Parties arising out of, based upon or resulting from (i)
any breach of any representation or warranty contained in or referred to in
Article 4 or 6 or in any schedule or exhibit or in the certificate delivered
by or on behalf of W and the Company pursuant to Section 9.02(a), in each
case, without regard for any exception for materiality, material adverse
effect or Material Adverse Effect contained therein (except that any
exception for materiality, material adverse effect or Material Adverse Effect
contained in the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
4.08(a), 4.09(d), 4.12(b)(iii), 4.16(p), 4.17(b), 4.22 and 4.23 and the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(iii) shall not be
disregarded for purposes of this Section 10.01(a)(i)), and (ii) any breach by
W or the Company of, or any failure of W or the Company to perform, any of
the covenants, agreements or obligations contained in or made pursuant to
this Agreement.   (b) Subject to Sections 10.02 and 10.03, from and after
the Closing, Parent hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
WCAS Securityholder and its Affiliates, and each of their respective
directors, officers, partners, employees and agents (collectively, the "W
Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by the W Indemnified Parties arising out of, based upon or resulting
from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty contained in or
referred to in Article 5 or in any schedule or   83    exhibit or in
any certificate delivered by or on behalf of Parent pursuant to Section
9.03(c) or 8.21(c), in each case, without regard for any exception
for materiality, material adverse effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect
contained therein (except that any exception for materiality, material
adverse effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect contained in the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.09(a), 5.10(d),
5.13(b)(iii), 5.18(b) and 5.20 and the certificates delivered pursuant to
Section 9.03(c) and 9.04(a)(iii) shall not be disregarded for purposes of
this Section 10.01(b)(i)), and (ii) any breach by Parent or Merger Co. of, or
any failure of Parent or Merger Co. to perform, any of the covenants,
agreements or obligations contained in or made pursuant to this
Agreement.   (c) In the event that a Person entitled to indemnification
under this Article 10 (the "Indemnified Party") shall incur or suffer any
Losses in respect of which indemnification may be sought under this Article
10 against the Person required to provide indemnification under this Article
10 (the "Indemnifying Party"), the Indemnified Party shall assert a claim
for indemnification by providing a written notice (the "Notice of Loss") to
the Indemnifying Party stating the nature and basis of such Notice of Loss.
The Notice of Loss shall be provided to the Indemnifying Party as soon
as practicable after the Indemnified Party becomes aware that it has incurred
or suffered a Loss. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure to provide
the Indemnifying Party with a Notice of Loss, or any failure to provide a
Notice of Loss in a timely manner as aforesaid, shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to the Indemnified
Party under this Section 10.01 except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party\'s ability to defend such claim is materially prejudiced by the
Indemnified Party\'s failure to give such Notice of Loss. If the Notice of
Loss relates to a Third Party Claim, then the procedures set forth in Section
10.01(d) shall be applicable. If the Notice of Loss does not relate to a
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from the
date of receipt of such Notice of Loss to object to any of the subject matter
and any of the amounts of the Losses set forth in the Notice of Loss, as the
case may be, by delivering written notice of objection thereof to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party fails to send a notice
of objection to the Notice of Loss within such 30 day period, then the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have agreed to the Notice of Loss and
shall be obligated to pay to the Indemnified Party the portion of the amount
specified in the Notice of Loss to which the Indemnifying Party has not
objected. If the Indemnifying Party sends a timely notice of objection, then
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to settle (without an obligation to settle) such claim for
indemnification. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party do not
settle such dispute within 30 days after the Indemnified Party\'s receipt of
the Indemnifying Party\'s notice of objection, then each of the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to seek enforcement of
their respective rights under this Article 10.   (d) Promptly after receipt
by an Indemnified Party of notice of the assertion of any claim or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding by a third Person (a "Third
Party Claim") in respect of which the Indemnified Party will seek
indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall so notify in writing
the Indemnifying Party, but any failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to the Indemnified
Party under this Section 10.01 except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party\'s ability to defend the Third Party Claim is materially prejudiced by
the Indemnified Party\'s failure to give such notice. In no event shall the
Indemnified Party admit any liability with respect thereto or settle,  
84    compromise, pay or discharge such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. With respect to any such claim as to which the
Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in writing the obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to assume the defense (at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense) of any
such claim through counsel of the Indemnifying Party\'s own choosing by so
notifying the Indemnified Party within 30 days of the receipt by the
Indemnifying Party of such notice from the Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that any such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ counsel to represent it at the Indemnifying
Party\'s expense if the Indemnified Party has been advised by its counsel
that there are one or more legal defenses available to it that are different
from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or that there
is otherwise a potential conflict between the interests of the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party, and in that event the reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party.
The parties each agree to render to the other party such assistance as may
reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of
any such claim, which assistance shall include, to the extent
reasonably requested by a party, the retention, and the provision to such
party, of records and information reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees of the other party available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
materials provided hereunder. The Indemnifying Party may not settle or
otherwise dispose of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
unless such settlement includes only the payment of monetary damages (which
are fully paid by the Indemnifying Party), does not impose any injunction or
equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party, does not require any admission
or acknowledgment of liability or fault of the Indemnified Party and contains
an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim.
None of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates may settle or
otherwise dispose of any Third Party Claim for which the Indemnifying
Party may have a liability under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   (e) With respect to any claim as to which the Indemnifying
Party shall have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder, after written notice by the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume control of the defense of
any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to
such Indemnified Party hereunder for any costs or fees subsequently incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof except if
the Indemnified Party has the right to employ counsel to represent it at
the Indemnifying Party\'s expense as set forth in Section 10.01(d). If
the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of the defense of such Third
Party Claim within 30 days after the Indemnifying Party\'s receipt of the
notice required pursuant to Section 10.01(d), then the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to defend such claim in such manner as it may deem
appropriate at the reasonable cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party.  
Section 10.02. Survival. The rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties to
assert a claim   85    under Section 10.01(a)(i), and the rights of the
W Indemnified Parties to assert a claim under Section 10.01(b)(i), shall
survive the Closing Date for a period (the "Survival Period") beginning at
the Closing Date and ending on the fifteen-month anniversary of the Closing
Date, and thereafter shall terminate and expire, except with respect to
liabilities for any item as to which, prior to the expiration of the Survival
Period, a Parent Indemnified Party or a W Indemnified Party, as applicable,
shall have asserted a claim in writing as required pursuant to the provisions
of this Article 10, in which case the liability for such claim shall continue
until such claim shall have been finally settled, decided or adjudicated.  
Section 10.03. Limitation on Liability.   (a) Subject to Section 10.03(e), W
shall not have any liability under Section 10.01(a) with respect to any
individual item of Loss or items of Losses arising out of substantially
similar facts and circumstances, unless such item or items of Losses exceed
$35,000 (the "De Minimis Amount") and W shall not have any liability under
Section 10.01(a) until the aggregate Losses under Section 10.01(a) (excluding
any individual item of Loss or items of Losses arising out of substantially
similar facts and circumstances that do not exceed the De Minimis Amount)
exceed an amount equal to $2,500,000 (the "Deductible Amount"), whereupon W
shall be liable for indemnification for all Losses in excess of the
Deductible Amount up to the Maximum Amount.   (b) Subject to Section
10.03(e), the maximum monetary liability of W under Section 10.01(a) of this
Agreement shall not exceed an amount equal to $15,000,000 (the "Maximum
Amount").   (c) Subject to Section 10.03(f), Parent shall not have any
liability under Section 10.01(b) with respect to any individual item of Loss
or items of Losses arising out of substantially similar facts and
circumstances, unless such item or items of Losses exceed the De Minimis
Amount, and Parent shall not have any liability under Section 10.01(b) until
the aggregate Losses under Section 10.01(b) (excluding any individual item of
Loss or items of Losses arising out of substantially similar facts and
circumstances that do not exceed the De Minimis Amount) exceed an amount
equal to the Deductible Amount, whereupon Parent shall be liable for
indemnification for all Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount up to the
Maximum Amount.   (d) Subject to Section 10.03(f), the maximum monetary
liability of Parent under Section 10.01(b) of this Agreement shall not exceed
the Maximum Amount.   (e) The limitations on liability set forth in Section
10.03(a) or (b) shall not apply with respect to (i) any breach of a
representation or warranty contained in or referred to in Article 4 or 6 or
in any schedule or exhibit or in the certificate delivered by or on behalf of
W or the Company pursuant to Section 9.02(a), or (ii) any breach by W or the
Company of, or any failure of W or the Company to perform, any of the
covenants, agreements or obligations contained in or made pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, in the event that any of the individuals listed in
Section 10.03(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule had actual knowledge of
such breach or actual knowledge of conduct that could reasonably be expected
to constitute a breach.   86     (f) The limitations on liability set
forth in Section 10.03(c) or (d) shall not apply with respect to (i) any
breach of a representation or warranty contained in or referred to in Article
5 or in any schedule or exhibit or in any certificate delivered by or on
behalf of Parent pursuant to Section 9.03(a) or 8.21(c), or (ii) any breach
by Parent of, or any failure of Parent to perform, any of the covenants,
agreements or obligations contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement, in
each case, in the event that any of the individuals listed in Section
10.03(f) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule had actual knowledge of such
breach or actual knowledge of conduct that could reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach.   (g) No Indemnifying Party shall be obligated under
this Agreement to indemnify any Indemnified Person for any lost profits or
consequential, incidental or punitive damages suffered or incurred by any
Indemnified Party, except to the extent any such damages are recovered
against such Indemnified Party in connection with a Third Party Claim.  
Section 10.04. Computation of Losses. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the amount of any Losses otherwise payable to
an Indemnified Party shall be reduced by the amount of net insurance
proceeds actually received by such Indemnified Party as compensation for the
damage or Losses caused by the act, or omission, fact or circumstance giving
rise to the Losses.   Section 10.05. Payment. (a) Any payment by W under
this Article 10 shall be made, at the option of W, in cash or by surrendering
up to 6,984,500 Parent Common Shares to Parent, which shall be valued at
their Fair Market Value as of the date of payment; provided that in no event
shall any election by W to satisfy an indemnification obligation in cash in
lieu of surrendering Parent Common Shares obligate W to make any cash payment
in excess of the Fair Market Value of the Parent Common Shares that W would
otherwise have surrendered had W not made such election (provided that no
such election by W shall limit in any way its obligation to surrender shares
of Parent Series B Preferred Stock (or cash in lieu thereof) in accordance
with this Article 10). If W makes any payment under this Article 10, in whole
or in part, by surrendering the entire 6,984,500 Parent Common Shares, and
the aggregate Fair Market Value of the 6,984,500 Parent Common Shares on the
date of payment is insufficient to satisfy W\'s indemnification obligations
under this Article 10, any additional payment by W under this Article 10
shall be made, at W\'s option, in cash or by surrendering shares of Parent
Series B Preferred Stock to Parent, which shares shall be valued at the Face
Amount of such shares plus any Accumulated Dividends and Current Period
Dividends (as such terms are defined in the Series B Certificate of
Designations) with respect to such shares accrued to, and not including,
the payment date and unpaid as of the payment date (such Face Amount plus
such dividends, the "Series B Indemnification Value"); provided that in no
event shall any election by W to satisfy an indemnification obligation in
cash in lieu of surrendering Parent Series B Preferred Stock obligate W to
make any cash payment in excess of the Series B Indemnification Value of the
shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock that W would otherwise have
surrendered (for purposes of this proviso, any shares of Parent Series B
Preferred Stock that have been previously redeemed by Parent pursuant to the
terms of the Parent Series B Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to represent
shares of Series B Preferred Stock that W would otherwise have surrendered)
had W not made such election (provided that no such election by W shall limit
in any way its obligations to make indemnity payments in the amounts required
under this Article 10). W hereby agrees that it shall either (i) retain
ownership of a sufficient number of Parent   87    Common Shares and
shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock to satisfy any indemnification
obligations it may have under this Article 10 until the fifteen-month
anniversary of the Closing Date or, in the event that a claim under Section
10.01(a) is pending at such time, until the resolution of such claim, or (ii)
prior to disposing of any Parent Common Shares or any shares of Parent Series
B Preferred Stock (other than pursuant to a redemption of any shares of
Parent Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms thereof), provide a
written agreement to Parent that it will make all future payments under this
Article 10 in cash to the extent of the Fair Market Value or Series
B Indemnification Value, as applicable, of any such Parent Common Shares or
shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock that W has disposed of and that
would have been subject to W\'s indemnification obligations under this
Article 10 if such disposition had not occurred. W hereby represents and
warrants that it has adequate resources, or the ability to call upon adequate
resources, required to satisfy its indemnity obligations under this Article
10. In the event that any of Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe VIII, L.P., WCAS
Capital Partners III, L.P. or WCAS Information Partners, L.P. liquidates,
dissolves or otherwise terminates its existence, such WCAS Securityholder
shall, prior to such liquidation, dissolution or termination, make adequate
provision on terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent to ensure that its
obligations under this Article 10 are or will be satisfied. Any reference to
"6,984,500 Parent Common Shares" in this Section 10.05 shall be deemed to
mean 6,984,500 Parent Common Shares, as such number may be adjusted
appropriately to account for any stock split, combination, recapitalization
or similar event.   (b) Any payment by Parent under this Article 10 shall be
made, at the option of Parent, (i) in cash, (ii) by issuing Parent Common
Shares to W, which shall be valued at their Fair Market Value as of the date
of payment, or (iii) by issuing shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock to
W on the terms and conditions set forth in the Series B Certificate of
Designations, which shall be valued at the Face Amount of such shares. All
payments by Parent under this Article 10 shall be made to Welsh, Carson,
Anderson and Stowe VIII, L.P. for the benefit of all WCAS Securityholders;
provided however, that Parent shall be permitted to make payment to the W
Indemnified Parties in cash under this Section 10.05(b) only to the extent
that the sum of (x) the aggregate amount of such cash plus (y) the total
value of the Warrants received by W under Section 8.09 does not exceed 20% of
the total value, as of the Closing Date, of the 6,984,500 Parent Common
Shares and the Warrants received by W under Section 8.09. For purposes of the
immediately preceding sentence, the total value of the 6,984,500 Parent
Common Shares shall be the Fair Market Value of such 6,984,500 Parent Common
Shares as of the Closing Date. In connection with any payment by Parent under
this Article 10 that shall be made by issuing Parent Common Shares or shares
of Parent Series B Preferred Stock, each of Parent and each
WCAS Securityholder shall cooperate in good faith and use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly make and process all necessary filings and applications
and obtain all consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations and
declarations or expiration or termination of any required waiting periods and
to comply with all applicable laws necessary for Parent to make such
payment.   Section 10.06. Exclusive Remedy. From and after
Closing, indemnification pursuant to this Article 10 shall be the exclusive
remedy of the parties hereto for any Loss or Losses arising out of or related
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except in the case of
fraud or a willful breach of this Agreement (provided that (a) with respect
to a willful breach of this Agreement by W or the Company, an individual
listed in Section 10.03(e) of the   88    Company Disclosure Schedule
had actual knowledge of such breach), and (b) with respect to a willful
breach of this Agreement by Parent, an individual listed in Section 10.03(f)
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule had actual knowledge of such breach).  
ARTICLE 11   TERMINATION   Section 11.01. Termination. This Agreement may
be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing:   (a) by mutual written consent of the parties hereto;   (b) by
any party, if the Closing has not occurred by November 30, 2003 (the
"Termination Date"), provided that the party seeking to exercise such right
is not then in material breach of any of its obligations under
this Agreement;   (c) by any party, if there shall be any law or regulation
that makes consummation of the Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibited
or if any judgment, injunction, order or decree enjoining Parent, the Company
or W from consummating the Transactions is entered and such judgment,
injunction, order or decree shall become final and nonappealable;   (d) by
Parent, the Company or W, if the adoption of this Agreement and approval of
the Merger by the shareholders of the Company, in accordance with the
applicable provisions of North Carolina Law, shall not have been obtained at
the time such adoption and approval are sought; provided that neither the
Company nor W may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.01(d)
if the failure of the Company\'s shareholders to adopt this Agreement and
approve the Merger results from any breach of this Agreement by the
Company or W;   (e) by Parent, if there shall have been a breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of W or the
Company contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in
Sections 9.02(a) would not be satisfied and (i) such breach is not reasonably
capable of being cured prior to the Termination Date or (ii) in the case of a
breach of a covenant or agreement, if such breach is reasonably capable of
being cured prior to the Termination Date, such breach shall not have been
cured prior to the Termination Date; provided that Parent shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.01(e) if Parent
is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;   (f) by the Company
or W, if there shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Co. contained in this
Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 9.03(a) would not be
satisfied and (i) such breach is not reasonably capable of being cured prior
to the Termination Date or (ii) if such breach is reasonably capable of being
cured prior to the Termination Date, such breach shall not have been cured
prior to the Termination Date; provided that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.01(f) if W or
the Company is then   89    in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement;   (g) by the Company, if, prior to the Company shareholder
meeting or the taking of the written consent referred to in Section 8.01(b),
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, in
response to an unsolicited Company Acquisition Proposal that did not
otherwise result from a breach of Section 8.03, that such proposal is a
Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not be permitted
to terminate this Agreement or the Merger under this Section 11.01(g), and
any purported termination under this Section 11.01(g) shall be void and of no
force or effect, unless (i) prior to or concurrently with such termination,
the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with the terms
of Section 11.02(b) and enters into a definitive agreement concerning a
Superior Proposal; (ii) the Company has complied in all material respects
with Section 8.03; (iii) the Company has notified Parent in writing at least
two Business Days prior to such termination of its intention to terminate
this Agreement and to enter into a binding written agreement concerning a
Company Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, attaching
to such written notice the most current version of such agreement (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the amount or form of
consideration to be involved in the Superior Proposal shall require a new
notice and a new two Business Day period); (iv) during such two Business
Day period, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent with
respect to any alteration of the terms of this Agreement or the Transactions
as Parent may propose; and (v) Parent does not make prior to such termination
of this Agreement an offer that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines, in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, is at least as favorable to the shareholders of the
Company as such Superior Proposal, it being understood that the Company shall
not enter into any such definitive agreement concerning a Superior Proposal
during such two Business Day period;   (h) by Parent, if, prior to the
Company shareholder meeting or the taking of the written consent referred to
in Section 8.01(b), the Board of Directors of the Company shall have failed
to recommend or shall have withdrawn or modified or changed in a manner
adverse to Parent its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the
Merger or shall have recommended a Superior Proposal (or the Board of
Directors of the Company resolves to do any of the foregoing); or   (i) by
Parent, if either the Company or W shall have intentionally and materially
breached any of its obligations under Section 8.03.   Section 11.02. Effect
of Termination.   (a) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 11.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no
liability on the part of any party hereto, except that termination of this
Agreement shall be without prejudice to any rights any party may have
hereunder against any other party for an intentional breach of any covenant,
agreement or obligation contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or
any knowing breach of any representation or warranty contained in or referred
to in this Agreement or in any schedule, exhibit or certificate delivered
hereunder. The agreements contained in this Section 11.02 and  
90    Sections 8.11, 12.03, 12.05, 12.06, 12.07, 12.08, 12.11 and 12.14
shall survive the termination hereof.   (b) In the event that this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 11.01(g) or by
Parent pursuant to Section 11.01(h), then the Company shall pay the
Termination Fee to Parent prior to or concurrently with such termination, in
the case of termination by the Company pursuant to Section 11.01(g), or
within two days of receipt by the Company of notice from Parent of such
termination, in the case of termination by Parent pursuant to
Section 11.01(h), such Termination Fee to be payable, in each case, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent.
In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
11.01(d), 11.01(e) or 11.01(i) and (A) after the date hereof and prior to
such termination, there shall have been made and publicly announced or
publicly communicated to the Company\'s shareholders a Company Acquisition
Proposal (which shall not have been withdrawn in good faith) and (B)
concurrently with or within twelve months of the date of such termination,
the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Company
Acquisition Proposal (which is subsequently consummated) or a Company

Acquisition Proposal.   ARTICLE 12   MISCELLANEOUS   Section 12.01.

or expense.   Section 12.04. Successors and Assigns; Benefit. The provisions
of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, provided that no
party may assign (other than by operation of law following the Closing),
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto except that (a)
Parent and Merger Co. may make such an assignment to one or more direct or
indirect wholly-owned Parent Subsidiaries, but any such assignment shall not
relieve Parent or Merger Co. of its obligations hereunder, and (b) the WCAS
Securityholders may assign to any Person the right to purchase in the
aggregate up to 10% of the Parent Series B Preferred Stock that the WCAS
Securityholders have agreed to purchase in the Parent Series B Sale, but any
such assignment shall not relieve the assigning WCAS Securityholder of its
obligations hereunder. In connection with any such assignment pursuant to
clause (b), each assignee shall agree to be a party to and be bound by the
provisions of this Agreement as a WCAS Securityholder hereunder and shall be
deemed to have made the representations and warranties set forth in Article 6
(other than Section 6.06). Subsequent to the Effective Time, in the event

exchange for, or in substitution of, any Parent Common Shares or shares of
Parent Series B Preferred Stock by reason of any

spin-off, partial or complete liquidation, stock dividend, split-up, sale of
assets, distribution to holders of Parent Common Shares and/or Parent Series
B Preferred Stock or combination of the Parent Common Shares or Parent Series
B Preferred Stock, or any other change in capital structure of Parent,

of this Agreement so as to fairly and equitably preserve, to the extent
practicable, the original rights and obligations of the parties hereto under
this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall confer
on any Person other than the parties hereto, and their respective successors
and assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by
reason of this Agreement, except that Section 8.14 is   93    intended
to confer rights and remedies to the officers and directors of the Company as
and to the extent set forth therein.   Section 12.05. Governing Law. All
matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of New York,

12.06. Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for

further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.   Section 12.07.
Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of

any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.   Section 12.08. Interpretation. When a reference is made in

or Parent Disclosure Schedule to the contrary, (i) the Company and Parent
acknowledge that the disclosure by the Company or Parent of any  
94    matter such schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an

hereto.   Section 12.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO

obligations under this Agreement to be performed at or prior to the Effective
Time, and whenever this Agreement requires the Company or any Subsidiary to

Effective Time, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking of
W to take all action within its control necessary to cause the Company and
each Subsidiary to take such action or refrain from taking such action, as
applicable; provided that in no event shall W or its Affiliates (i) be
required to take any action that, after being advised by counsel, would

Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, respectively.   96     IN
