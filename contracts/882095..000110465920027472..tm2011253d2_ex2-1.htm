No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the
part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such
power, right, privilege or remedy. No single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived
any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such
claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf
of such Party and any such waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. At any time prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a)&nbsp;extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b)&nbsp;waive any breach of the representations and warranties
of the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c)&nbsp;waive compliance by the other with any
of the agreements or covenants contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if is expressly set forth in
a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Party or Parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. The rights and remedies provided herein shall be cumulative
and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by any Legal Requirement except to the extent set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(d)</U>.</P>

Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions: (i)&nbsp;each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom
or, if (but only if) such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle County

proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and
(ii)&nbsp;the right of specific performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company
