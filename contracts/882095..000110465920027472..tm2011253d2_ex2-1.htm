The Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

  



  

Section 1

  



  

 _THE OFFER_

  



  

1.1 The Offer.

  



  

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall
not have been terminated in accordance with _Section 8_, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event more than 10
business days after the date of this Agreement (subject to the Company having
timely provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant to
_Sections 1.1(e)_ and  _1.2(b)_ ), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act) the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding Shares (other than Shares to
be cancelled pursuant to _Sections 2.5(a)(i)_ and  _2.5(a)(ii)_
(collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ")), at a price per Share equal to the
Offer Price, net to the seller in cash, without interest and subject to any
withholding of Tax in accordance with _Section 2.6(e)_.

  



  

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of
Purchaser to (and of Parent to cause Purchaser to) accept for payment,
and pay for, any Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant
to the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted under applicable Legal Requirements) of the conditions set forth in
_Annex I_ (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "), and no other
conditions. The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the  "
_Offer to Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement,
the Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition and the other Offer
Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the amount
of cash constituting the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition (to the
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements) and (iii) make any
other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with
the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall not (A) decrease
the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer
(provided that nothing herein shall limit the ability of Parent and Purchaser
to increase the cash consideration payable in the Offer), (C) decrease the
maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose
conditions or requirements to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions,
(E) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, Termination Condition or
the conditions set forth in _clause (e)_ or _(g)_ of _Annex I_ , (F)
otherwise amend or modify any of the other terms of the Offer in a manner
that adversely affects, or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
any holder of Shares in its capacity as such, (G) terminate the Offer or
accelerate, extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date, in each case,
except as provided in _Sections 1.1(c)_ or _1.1(d)_ or (H) provide any 
"subsequent offering period" (or any extension thereof) within the meaning of
Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Offer may not be
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or any rescheduled Expiration Date) of
the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section
8_.

  



   

2

 



    



  

(c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall
initially be scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern
Time on the date that is 20 business days (determined as set forth in Rule
14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) following the Offer
Commencement Date (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company) (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ", and such date or such subsequent
date to which the Initial Expiration Date of the Offer is extended in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the Parties' respective termination rights under _Section 8_: (i)
if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not
satisfied (unless such condition is waivable by Purchaser or Parent and has
been waived) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the
Offer for additional periods of up to 10 business days per extension, to
permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; and (ii) Purchaser shall, and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer from time to time for any
period required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position of
the SEC, the staff thereof or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser (1) be required to extend the
Offer beyond the earlier to occur of (x) the valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8_ and (y) the End Date (such
earlier occurrence, the " _Extension Deadline_ ") or (2) be permitted to
extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior written
consent of the Company.

  



  

(d) Termination of Offer. Nothing in this _Section 1.1_ shall be
deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the
Company, Parent or Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8_. In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section 8_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
immediately, irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall
not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall immediately return, and shall cause any depository acting on
behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

  



  

(e) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the Offer
Commencement Date, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender
offer statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") that
will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase, form of the
related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, (ii) make all
deliveries, mailings and telephonic notices required by Rule 14d-3 under the
Exchange Act and (iii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable
Legal Requirements. Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Offer
Documents filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to (x) comply in
all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal
Requirements and (y) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
covenant is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to information supplied
by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to
respond promptly to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its
staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser further
agree to take all steps necessary to promptly cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the Company
Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company shall promptly
furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or Parent's legal
counsel all information concerning the Company and the Company's stockholders
that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with any action
contemplated by this _Section 1.1(e)_. The Company and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
(including any response to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC
or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC,
and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable consideration to any such
comments made by the Company or its counsel. Parent and Purchaser agree to
provide the Company and its counsel with any comments (including oral
comments) Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those
comments (including oral comments).

Parent shall cause to be provided to Purchaser, on a timely basis, all of the
funds necessary to purchase all Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a
timely basis, all of Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

(g) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Offer Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

(h) Acceptance. Subject only to the satisfaction or, to the extent
waivable by Purchaser or Parent, waiver by Purchaser or Parent of each of
the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
(i) immediately after the Expiration Date irrevocably accept for payment all
Shares tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (the time of
such acceptance, the " _Offer Acceptance Time_ ") and (ii) as promptly as
practicable after the Offer Acceptance Time (and in any event within
three business days) pay for such Shares.

the notice and other information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and
(ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 and related documents to be disseminated to
holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements, including by setting the Stockholder List Date as the record

of the DGCL. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to (x)
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable
Legal Requirements and (y) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
covenant is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by or on
behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to
respond promptly to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or
its staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further
agrees to take all steps necessary to promptly cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements. Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish or otherwise make
available to the Company or the Company's legal counsel all information
concerning Parent or Purchaser that may be required or reasonably requested
in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section 1.2(a)_. Parent
and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any response to any comments (including oral
comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable consideration to
any such comments made by Parent or its counsel. The Company agrees to provide
Parent and its counsel with any comments (including oral comments) the
Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments (including oral
comments).

hereof furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any
available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in
stock depositories, in each case as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists
of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and
such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
Offer and the Merger (the date of the list used to determine the Persons to
whom the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, which
date shall not be more than 10 business days prior to the date the Offer
Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the " _Stockholder

their agents shall hold in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement the information contained in any such labels, listings and files.

Corporation.

  



  

(c) As of the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the respective individuals who served as the

any stockholder of the Company:

  



  

(i) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Company (or held in the Company's treasury) shall be cancelled and retired

therefor;

  



  

(ii) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by
Parent, Purchaser or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

  



  

(iii) except as provided in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ above and
subject to _Section 2.5(b)_, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including any Shares subject to vesting or employment based
forfeiture conditions (" _Restricted Shares_ ") (other than any Dissenting
Shares, which shall have only those rights set forth in _Section 2.7_) shall
be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), in each case without any interest thereon, without regard
to any vesting or employment based forfeiture conditions which were applicable
to the corresponding Restricted Shares and subject to any withholding of
Taxes in accordance with _Section 2.6(e)_; and

  



  

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
Purchaser then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, subject to
this _Section 2.5(a)_, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable
holder of such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with _Section
2.6_.

  



  

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares
by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration

2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
agent (the " _Depository Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the
aggregate Offer Price to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled
pursuant to _Section 1.1(b)_ and to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_
") for the holders of Shares to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration to
which holders of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section
2.5_. Promptly after (and in any event no later than the third business day
after) the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Depository Agent cash sufficient to make the payment of
the aggregate Offer Price payable pursuant to _Section 1.1(h)_. On or prior
to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.5_ (together with the amount
deposited pursuant the immediately preceding sentence, the " _Payment Fund_
"). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to pay the
aggregate Offer Price in the Offer and the aggregate Merger Consideration in
the Merger. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_  that such investments shall be (w)
in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, (x) in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, (y) in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding one billion dollars, or (z) in money
market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a
recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of
the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three months. To the extent Parent becomes aware that (i) there are
any losses with respect to any such investments or (ii) the Payment Fund has
diminished for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to
make prompt cash payment pursuant to _Section 1.1(h)_ and _Section 2.5_,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace
or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund
is, at all times during the duration of the Payment Fund, maintained at a
level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments pursuant to
_Section 1.1(h)_ and _Section 2.5_.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
three business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
delivered to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
(i) Shares represented by a certificate evidencing such Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or (ii) Book-Entry Shares, who, in each case was entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5_, (A) a form of
letter of transmittal, which shall be in reasonable and customary form and
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section
2.6(f)_, if applicable) to the Paying Agent, or a customary agent's message
in respect to Book-Entry Shares, and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration issuable and payable in respect of such Shares pursuant
to _Section 2.5_. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.6(f)_, if
applicable) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal in
the case of Certificates, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to the instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be
cancelled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the
benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent that such transfer or other similar Taxes either have
been paid or are not applicable. None of Parent, Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for the transfer and other
similar Taxes described in this _Section 2.6(b)_ under any circumstance.
Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry
Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares
are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.6_, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.5_.

  



  

(c) At any time following 12 months after the Effective Time,
Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (with respect to the aggregate Merger Consideration to which
holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.5_) which had
been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all interest and other income
received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar
Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its
designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as
otherwise provided herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this Agreement.

  



  

(e) Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and
Purchaser, and their Affiliates, the Paying Agent or the Depository Agent, as
the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be
deducted and withheld, from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under any
Legal Requirement with respect to Taxes. Any amounts so deducted and withheld
and paid over to the applicable Governmental Body in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such deduction or withholding was made.

  



  

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of the
Shares formerly represented by that Certificate, or by a representative of
that holder, claiming that Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by that holder of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (which
shall not exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such
Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to
be deducted or withheld pursuant to _Section 2.6(e)_), in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this _Section 2_.

  



  

2.7 Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and held by holders who are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their respective demands
for appraisal of such Shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of
the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn
nor lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be automatically
cancelled and no longer outstanding, shall cease to exist and shall be
entitled to only such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ that if any such holder shall have failed
to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holder's Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld
pursuant to _Section 2.6(e)_), and such Shares shall not be deemed to be
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and
Purchaser of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any
Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, in each case prior to the
Effective Time. Parent and Purchaser shall have the right to direct and
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands,
and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent and
Purchaser, settle or offer to settle, or make any payment with respect to, any
such demands, approve any withdrawal of any such demands or agree or commit
to do any of the foregoing.

2.8 Treatment of Company Options.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is then
outstanding and unexercised, whether or not vested and which has a per
share exercise price that is less than the Merger Consideration, shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to (i)
the excess of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price payable
per Share under such Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of
Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event later than the second payroll date following the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, pay the consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 2.8(a)_, net of any applicable withholding Taxes, to the holders of
Company Options through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving
Corporation's payroll.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all
actions that are necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and award
agreements pursuant to which Company Options are outstanding or otherwise) to
effect the transactions described in this _Section 2.8_.

  



  

2.9 Further Action. The Parties agree to take all necessary action
to cause the Merger to become effective in accordance with this  _Section 2_
as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer without a
meeting of the Company's stockholders, as provided in Section 251(h) of the
DGCL. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser and
the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of
the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

3.5 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

  



  

(a) Since January 1, 2018, the Company has filed or furnished on a
timely basis all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required
to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC (as supplemented,
modified or amended since the time of filing, the " _Company SEC Documents_
"). As of their respective dates, or, if amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of (and giving effect to) the last such amendment
(and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the date
of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), the
Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2001, as
amended (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to those Company SEC
Documents, and, except to the extent that information contained in such
Company SEC Document has been revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior
to the date of this Agreement) by a later filed Company SEC Document, none of
the Company SEC Documents when filed or furnished contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(b) The financial statements (including any related notes and
schedules) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
covered (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial
statements or, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as may
be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, 8-K or any successor form under the
Exchange Act); and (iii) fairly presented, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of the respective dates thereof and the
results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the periods covered
thereby (subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to the
absence of notes and to normal and recurring year-end adjustments that are
not, individually or in the aggregate, material).

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

(c) The Company maintains a system of "internal control over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act),
which is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures
that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of
the Company that could have a material effect on its financial statements.
The Company's management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
the Company's system of internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and, except as set forth in the
Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, that
assessment concluded that those controls were effective. To the knowledge of
the Company, since January 1, 2020, neither the Company nor the Company's
independent registered accountant has identified or been made aware of: (1)
any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of
the internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company, which
is reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information; or (2) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves the management or other employees of
the Company who have a significant role in the Company's internal control
over financial reporting.

  



  

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as
defined in and required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that
are reasonably designed to ensure that all information required to be
disclosed in the Company's reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
enable the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports. The Company is in compliance in
all material respects with all current listing and corporate governance
requirements of NASDAQ.

  



  

(e) The Company is not a party to, nor does it have any obligation
or other commitment to become a party to, "off-balance sheet arrangements"
(as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act) where the
result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of
any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the
Company in the Company SEC Documents.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to
the Company SEC Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the
Company SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review and there are no
inquiries or investigations by the SEC or any internal investigations pending
or threatened in writing, in each case regarding any accounting practices of
the Company, except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(g) Each document required to be filed by the Company with the SEC
in connection with the Offer, including the Schedule 14D-9 (the "
_Company Disclosure Documents_ "), and any amendments or supplements thereto,
when filed, distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Company's
stockholders, as applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company Disclosure
Documents, at the time of the filing of such Company Disclosure Documents or
any supplement or amendment thereto with the SEC and at the time such Company
Disclosure Documents or any supplements or amendments thereto are first
distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Company's stockholders, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

  



  

(i) The information with respect to the Company that the Company
furnishes to Parent or Purchaser specifically for use in the Offer
Documents, at the time of the filing of and at the time of any distribution
or dissemination of the Offer Documents, will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no
representation with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Company
Disclosure Documents.

  



  

3.6 Absence of Changes; No Material Adverse Effect. Except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, from September 30, 2019, through
the date of this Agreement:

  



  

(a) (i) the Company has operated in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and (ii)
the Company has not taken any action or failed to take any action that would
have constituted a breach of _Sections 5.2(b)(i)_ ,  _5.2(b)(ii)_ ,

assets (excluding Intellectual Property Rights) owned by it as of the date of
this Agreement, and all of such assets are owned by the Company free and clear

not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2018, the Company has
not received any notice regarding (i) any material violation or breach or
default under any lease related to the Leased Real Property that has not since
been cured, (ii) any material pending or threatened in writing condemnation
of any portion of the Leased Real Property or (iii) building, fire or zoning
code violations with respect to the Leased Real Property, in each case in
this _clause (iii)_ that is material to the Company.

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8_ (the " _Pre-Closing Period_ "), upon reasonable
advance notice to the Company, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, provide Parent and Parent's Representatives with
reasonable access during normal business hours of the Company to the
Company's Representatives, designated personnel and assets and to all
existing books, records, documents and information relating to the Company,
and promptly provide Parent and Parent's Representatives with all reasonably
requested information regarding the business of the Company and such
additional financial, operating and other data and information regarding the
Company, as Parent may reasonably request, in each case for any reasonable
business purpose related to the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_
, _however_ , that any such access shall be conducted at Parent's expense, at
a reasonable time, under the supervision of appropriate personnel of the
Company and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal
operation of the business of the Company. Any such access shall be subject to
the Company's reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and
shall not include invasive testing. Nothing herein shall require the Company
to disclose any information to Parent if such disclosure would, in its
reasonable discretion and after notice to Parent (i) jeopardize any attorney-
client or other legal privilege (so long as the Company has reasonably
cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of or to disclose such
information on a basis that does not waive such privilege with respect
thereto), (ii) contravene any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract (so
long as the Company has reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit disclosure
to the extent permitted by Legal Requirements or the contractual
counterparty); _provided, however_ , in the case of _clause (ii)_ , that the
Parties shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such
information to the extent doing so could reasonably (in the good faith belief
of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel)) be managed through
the use of customary "clean room" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee
Representatives of Parent could be provided access to such information. With
respect to the information disclosed pursuant to this _Section 5.1_, Parent
shall comply with, and shall instruct Parent's Representatives to comply
with, all of its obligations under the Mutual Confidential
Disclosure Agreement, effective as of January 7, 2020, between the Company
and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of (A) any notice or
other communication received by such Party from any Governmental Body in
connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is
or may be required in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions; or (B) any Legal Proceeding commenced or, to any Party's
knowledge, threatened in writing against, such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to, involving or affecting such Party or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case in connection with, arising from or
otherwise relating to the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction.

  



  

(ii) (A) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
change, circumstance, condition, development, effect, event, occurrence or
state of facts that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, or would reasonably be expected to make the
satisfaction of any of the Offer Conditions impossible or unlikely, and (B)
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of any change, circumstance,
condition, development, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts that has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
or would reasonably be expected to make the satisfaction of any of the Offer
Conditions impossible or unlikely.

  



  

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 5.1(b)_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to
any Party. The failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any Offer
Condition or any of the conditions set forth in  _Section 7_ or give rise to
any right to terminate under _Section 8_.

  



  

5.2 Operation of the Company's Business. During the Pre-Closing
Period, except (x) as expressly required by this Agreement or as required by
applicable Legal Requirements or to the extent necessary to comply with any

shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), or (z) as set
forth in _Section 5.2_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule:

  



  

(a) the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)

39

 



    

  



   



  

5.3 No Solicitation.

  



  

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.3_, during the Pre-
Closing Period the Company shall not, and shall cause its officers and
directors not to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) continue any
solicitation, knowing encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) (A)
solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information) any inquiries regarding, or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (other than discussions solely to clarify the
terms and conditions of such proposal or offer), (B) engage in, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding,
or furnish to any other Person any non-public information in connection with,
or for the purpose of soliciting or knowingly encouraging or facilitating, an
Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that would reasonably be

terms of this provision prohibit such discussion), (C) approve, adopt, endorse
or recommend or enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement,
agreement in principle or similar agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (other than an

Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) from the restrictions on
"business combinations" or any similar provision contained in applicable

the date hereof, the Company shall discontinue electronic or physical data
room access granted, and request the prompt return or destruction (to the
extent provided for by the applicable confidentiality agreement) of all
information or documents previously furnished to any Person (other than
Parent, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives) that has made,
has indicated an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal and all material
incorporating such information created by any such Person.

  



  

(b) If at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time the Company or any of its
Representatives receives a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from any
Person or group of Persons, which Acquisition Proposal was made on or after
the date of this Agreement and did not result from a material breach of this
_Section 5.3_, and the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in
a Superior Offer and that the failure to take such action described in
_clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ below would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Legal Requirements, then, notwithstanding anything in
_Section 5.3(a)_ to the contrary, the Company and its Representatives may (x)
furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company to the Person
or group of Persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that
the Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 36
hours) provide to Parent any information concerning the Company that is
provided to any Person to the extent access to such information was not
previously provided to Parent or its Representatives; and (y) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group
of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ , in the case of
_clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ , that at or prior to the first time that the Company
furnishes any information to or participates in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person on or after the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall provide written notice to Parent of such determination in
good faith of the Board of Directors as provided for above.

  



  

   

40

 



    



  

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall (i) promptly
(and in any event within 36 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if any
inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal are received by the Company or
any of its Representatives and provide to Parent a copy of any written
Acquisition Proposal (including any proposed term sheet, letter of intent,
acquisition agreement or other agreement or other supporting materials with
respect thereto) and a summary of any material unwritten terms and conditions
thereof (and indicate the identity of such Person), and (ii) keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal on a prompt basis (and in any event within
36 hours of such material development, discussion or negotiation).

  



  

(d) Nothing in this _Section 5.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from disclosing to the stockholders of the Company
any "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from taking and disclosing such other
position or disclosure as is required under Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from taking
any action necessary to comply with applicable Legal Requirements; _provided,
however_ , that, the Board of Directors shall not effect a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation except in accordance with _Section 6.1(b)_.

  



  

(e) The Company agrees that in the event any Representative of the
Company acting on behalf of the Company takes any action that, if taken by
the Company, would constitute a breach of this _Section 5.3_, the Company
shall be deemed to be in breach of this  _Section 5.3_.

(a) Subject to _Section 6.1(b)_, the Company hereby consents to
the inclusion of a description of the Company Board Recommendation in the
Offer Documents. During the Pre-Closing Period, subject to _Section 6.1(b)_,
neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A)

Time), _provided_ , that Parent may only make such request once with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , that each time a Determination
Notice is given Parent shall, subject to the following provision, be entitled
to make a new such request); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company
shall not be required to provide any such affirmation during the two or three
business day periods, as applicable, following the giving of a Determination
Notice, (D) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer
relating to the Shares by a Person unaffiliated with Parent, fail to publicly
affirm the Company Board Recommendation and recommend that the Company's
stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within 10
business days after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or, if earlier,
by the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the
scheduled date of the Offer Acceptance Time) or (E) fail to include the

Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose
to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or cause or allow the Company to
execute or enter into any Contract, letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle or term sheet with respect to, or that
is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the
Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would
otherwise materially impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the
Transactions (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

  



  

   

41

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, and subject to
compliance with the other provisions of this _Section 6.1_:

  



  

 (i) if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation
with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, the Board of Directors
shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Offer, (x) the Board of Directors may make a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation, or (y) provided that the Company is not in
breach of _Section 5.3 _in any material respect and in a manner that led to
such Acquisition Proposal and subject to the other provisions of _Section
8.1_ _ (e)_, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_ to enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to such Superior
Offer, in each case, if and only if: (A) the Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under applicable Legal
Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of
its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or
terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ at least three
business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or termination (a " _Determination Notice_ ") (which notice
shall not constitute a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination)
and, if requested in writing by Parent during such three business day period,
shall have negotiated, and caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good
faith with respect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement or another
proposal to the extent proposed by Parent so that such Acquisition Proposal
would cease to constitute a Superior Offer; and (C) (1) the Company shall
have provided to Parent information with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
in accordance with _Section 5.3(c)_, as well as a copy of any acquisition
agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and a copy of any
financing commitments relating thereto (or, if not provided in writing to the
Company, a written summary of the material terms thereof), (2) the Company
shall have given Parent the three business day period after the Determination
Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another
proposal so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Offer, and (3) after giving effect to the proposals made by Parent
during such period, if any, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor, the Board of Directors shall have determined, in good
faith, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer and that
the failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under applicable Legal
Requirements. Issuance of any "stop, look and listen" communication by or on
behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, taking and disclosing a position or otherwise making any
disclosure as is required under Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or otherwise complying with
applicable Legal Requirements shall not, in and of itself, be considered a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a
Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures set forth in this
_Section 6.1_. The provisions of this _Section 6.1(b)(i)_ shall also apply
to any change to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount and
timing of payment of consideration) or other material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination Notice ( _provided_ that
for the purposes of such subsequent Determination Notice, all references to
"three business days" shall be deemed to be "two business days"); and

  



  

   

42

 



    



  

 (ii) other than in connection with a Superior Offer (which shall
be subject to _Section 6.1(b)(i)_), the Board of Directors may make a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if:
(A) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Company's outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have
given Parent a Determination Notice at least three business days prior to
making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation and, if desired by
Parent, during such three business day period shall have negotiated, and
caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with respect to any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or another proposal to the extent
proposed by Parent so that a Company Adverse Change Recommendation would no
longer be necessary; and (C) (1) the Company shall have specified in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances that render a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation necessary, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the
three business day period after the Determination Notice to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation would no longer be necessary, and (3)
after giving effect to the proposals made by Parent during such period, if
any, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors
shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company
Adverse Change Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Board of Directors under applicable Legal Requirements. The provisions
of this _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ shall also apply to any material change to the
facts and circumstances specified by the Company pursuant to _clause (C)(1)_
above and require a new Determination Notice ( _provided_ that for the
purposes of such subsequent Determination Notice, all references to "three
business days" shall be deemed to be "two business days").

  



  

   

43

 



    



  

6.2 Filings, Consents and Approvals.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to take
promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under the Antitrust Laws, that may be asserted by any Governmental
Body, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, but in
no case later than the End Date, including providing as promptly as reasonably
practicable and advisable all non-legally privileged information reasonably
required by any Governmental Body pursuant to its evaluation of
the Transactions under the HSR Act. Subject to the terms of this _Section
6.2_, the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain from any
Governmental Body all consents, approvals authorizations or orders required to
be obtained under the Antitrust Laws or to avoid the entry or enactment of
any injunction or other order or decree relating to any Antitrust Law
that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required to, and
without the prior written consent of Parent the Company shall not, sell,
license, divest or dispose of or hold separate (through the establishment of a
trust or otherwise) or agree to any other structural, behavioral or conduct
remedy, before or after the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, any
entities, businesses, divisions, operations, products or product lines,
assets, Intellectual Property Rights or businesses of Parent, the Company (or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates) or agree to any
restriction on the conduct of such businesses which (A) would materially and
adversely affect the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or (B) would require the sale, license, divestiture, disposal, or
holding separate of, or any other structural, behavioral or conduct remedy
involving the Product Candidates. Nothing in this _Section 6.2_ shall require
the Parent or the Company to take or agree to take any action unless the
effectiveness of such action is conditioned upon Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries be obligated to litigate or participate in the
litigation of any action, whether judicial or administrative, brought by any
Governmental Body challenging or seeking to restrain, prohibit or place
conditions on the consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if
applicable, to): (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (but no later than
10 business days after the date of this Agreement), make an appropriate
filing of all Notification and Report forms as required by the HSR Act, with
respect to the Transactions and (ii) cooperate with each other in determining
whether, and promptly preparing and making, any other filings, notifications
or other consents are required to be made with, or obtained from, any other
Governmental Bodies in connection with the Transactions.

  



  

   

44

 



    



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this
_Section 6.2_, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party shall (i) give the
other Parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental
Body or brought by a third party before any Governmental Body, in each case,
with respect to the Transactions under the Antitrust Laws, (ii) keep the
other Parties reasonably informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iii) promptly inform the
other Parties of, and wherever practicable give the other party reasonable
advance notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, any communication to
or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Body in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iv)
promptly furnish to the other Party, subject to an appropriate
confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and outside
consultants, with copies of documents provided to or received from any
Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding (except that documents, including
"4(c) and 4(d) documents" as that term is used under the HSR Act, that
contain valuation information can be redacted), (v) subject to an appropriate
confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and outside
consultants, and to the extent reasonably practicable, consult and cooperate
with the other Parties and consider in good faith the views of the other
Parties in connection with any written analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding, and (vi) except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the
Transactions, give the other Party reasonable prior notice and permit
authorized Representatives of the other Party to be present at each meeting or
conference, including by telephone, relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in advance in connection with any argument, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding.

  



  

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall to the extent
permissible under applicable Legal Requirements and reasonably
practicable and where doing so would not reasonably be expected to impair or
adversely affect the Company, any of its plans with respect to the Product
Candidates or its ability to interact with any Governmental Body consistent
with companies at similar stages of development in the pharmaceutical
industry (in each case as determined in good faith by the Company) (i) offer
Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company prior to any proposed
material meeting or other material communication with the FDA, EMA, the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (" _CMS_ ") or any other Specified
Governmental Body relating to any Product Candidate or material Governmental
Authorization (it being understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to delay or modify any of its actions as a result of this _Section
6.2(d)_), (ii) promptly inform Parent of, and provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review, in advance, any material filing proposed to
be made by or on behalf of the Company, and any material correspondence or
other material communication proposed to be submitted or otherwise transmitted
to the FDA, EMA, CMS or any other Specified Governmental Body by or on behalf
of the Company, in each case relating to any Product Candidate or material
Governmental Authorization (it being understood that in no event shall the
Company be required to delay any such filings, correspondence or
communication), (iii) keep Parent reasonably informed of any material
communication (written or oral) with or from the FDA, EMA, CMS or any other
Specified Governmental Body or relating to any Product Candidate or
Governmental Authorization and (iv) promptly inform Parent and provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity (but no more than two business days, to
the extent practicable) to comment, in each case, prior to making any
material change to any study protocol, adding any new trial, making any
material change to a manufacturing plan or process, making any material change
to a development timeline or initiating, or making any material change to,
commercialization and reimbursement activities or materials (including
promotional and marketing activities and materials) relating to any Product
Candidate. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any significant data
relating to any Product Candidate, including information related to any
significant adverse events with respect to any Product Candidate, in each
case which it discovers after the date hereof.

  



  

   

45

 



    



  

(e) Neither Party shall enter into any agreement, transaction, or
any agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger or
acquisition) that would reasonably be expected to make it materially more
difficult, or to materially increase the time required, to (i) obtain the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, (ii) avoid
the entry of, the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order that would materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (iii) obtain all authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals of Governmental Bodies necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

6.3 Employee Benefits.

  



  

(a) For a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the one year anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide,
or cause to be provided, to those employees of the Company who are employed
by the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continue
to be actively employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate
thereof) during such period (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) the
base salary or wage rate and annual cash bonus opportunities (excluding
equity-based compensation opportunities) that are, in each case, no less than
those provided by the Company immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time; (ii) retirement and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided by the Company immediately prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time; and (iii) severance benefits no less favorable than those
provided to by the Company immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time.

  



  

(b) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible
to continue to participate in the Surviving Corporation's health and welfare
benefit plans (to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to
participate under the health and welfare benefit plans of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time); _provided, however_ , that (i)
nothing in this _Section 6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the
right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such
health or welfare benefit plan at any time, subject to the requirements set
forth in _Section 6.3(a)_, and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation
terminates any such health or welfare benefit plan (upon expiration of any
appropriate transition period), then the Continuing Employees shall be
eligible to participate in the Surviving Corporation's (or an
Affiliate's) health and welfare benefit plans to the extent that coverage
under such plans is replacing comparable coverage under an Employee Plan in
which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective
Time. To the extent that service is relevant under any benefit plan of Parent
or an Affiliate and/or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall ensure
that such benefit plan shall, for all purposes, credit Continuing Employees
for service prior to the Effective Time with the Company and its
Affiliates or their respective predecessors; _provided_ , that, if such
benefit plan replaces a benefit plan of the Company that recognized service
for the same purpose, such service will be recognized to the same extent that
such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the
corresponding benefit plan of the Company. Nothing in this _Section 6.3_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any
Person to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each
Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.

(c) To the extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements,
with respect to any employee benefit plans maintained for the benefit of the
Continuing Employees following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation, any of its Affiliates, and any successor
thereto, to (i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-
existing condition limitations or waiting period requirements to the same
extent waived or satisfied under comparable plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible, co-
insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, amounts paid by
such employees during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs
under similar plans maintained by the Company.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.3_ are solely for the
benefit of the Parties, and no provision of this _Section 6.3_ is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, and no current
or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or
have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

  



  

6.4 ESPP. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all necessary actions under the Company
ESPP to provide that (a) the "Offering" (as defined in the Company ESPP) in
effect as of the date of this Agreement shall be the final Offering (such
period, the " _Final Offering_ ") and no further Offering shall commence
pursuant to the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement, and (b) each
individual participating in the Final Offering on the date of this Agreement
shall not be permitted to (i) increase his or her payroll contribution rate
pursuant to the Company ESPP from the rate in effect when the Final Offering
commenced or (ii) make separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP
on or following the date of this Agreement, except as may be required
by applicable Legal Requirement. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Company shall take all action that may be necessary to, effective upon the
Offer Acceptance Time, (A) cause the Final Offering, to the extent that it
would otherwise be ongoing at the Offer Acceptance Time, to be terminated no
later than five business days prior to the date on which the Offer Acceptance
Time occurs; (B) make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to
reflect the Final Offering, but otherwise treat the Final Offering as a fully
effective and completed Offering for all purposes pursuant to the Company
ESPP; and (C) cause the exercise (as of no later than five business days
prior to the date on which the Offer Acceptance Time occurs) of each
outstanding purchase right pursuant to the Company ESPP. On such exercise
date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to
the Company ESPP within each participant's payroll withholding account to the
purchase of Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and each
Share shall be an outstanding Share and entitled to the Merger Consideration.
The Company shall adopt such resolutions as are necessary to terminate the
Company ESPP effective as of immediately prior to, and conditional upon the
occurrence of, the Offer Acceptance Time.

6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

  



  

(a) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent
agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time) now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of the Company under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Company and any indemnification or other similar agreements of the Company
set forth on _Section 6.5(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in each
case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms and shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Indemnified Person (as defined below), and Parent shall
cause the Company to perform its obligations thereunder. Without limiting the
foregoing, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, and the Surviving Corporation
agrees that it will, indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is as of
the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of the Company or who is as of the date of this Agreement,
or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the
request of the Company as a director or officer of another Person (the "
_Indemnified Persons_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including this Agreement and the transactions
and actions contemplated hereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or
is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of
another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal
Requirements. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x)
each Indemnified Person will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred
in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in accordance with
the organizational documents and any indemnification or other similar
agreements of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as
in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that any Indemnified
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to
the extent required by the DGCL or the Surviving Corporation's or any of its
Subsidiaries' certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) or any such indemnification or other similar
agreements, as applicable; to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by final adjudication that such Indemnified Person is not
entitled to indemnification and (y) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any
such matter.

  



  

   

48

 



    



  

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in
effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by the Company or provide substitute policies for the Company and
its current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the
directors' and officers' insurance coverage currently maintained by the
Company, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having
other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before
the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by
A.M. Best with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance),
except that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required
to pay with respect to such insurance policies an annual premium greater than
300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior
to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving
Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section
6.5(b)_ it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the
years within such six year period for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.
In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may purchase
a "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for the Company
and its current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by
the directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less
than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the
insured persons than the directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time;
_provided_ that in no event shall the cost of any such tail policy exceed the
Maximum Amount. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

  



  

(c) In the event that the Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Company, as applicable,
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Company assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.5_.

  



  

   

49

 



    



   



  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.5_ (i) shall survive the
acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation
of the Merger and (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified
Persons), his or her heirs, successors, assigns and representatives, and (iii)
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation or contribution that
any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless required by
applicable Legal Requirement, this _Section 6.5_ may not be amended, altered
or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to adversely
affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their successors,
assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified
Person.

  



  

6.6 Stockholder Litigation. In the event that any litigation
related to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions is
brought by any stockholder or other holder of Company securities (whether
directly or on behalf of the Company or otherwise) against the Company and/or
its directors or officers, the Company shall promptly notify Parent and shall
keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status
thereof. The Company shall give Parent the (a) opportunity to participate in
the defense of any such litigation, (b) right to review and comment on all
material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with
such litigation (and shall give due consideration to Parent's comments and
other advice with respect to such litigation) and (c) right to consult on any
settlement with respect to such litigation, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Parent's prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall
Parent be required to consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) to any such settlement that does not provide for the
unconditional release of Parent, its Affiliates and Representatives and all
Persons entitled to indemnification by Parent or the Company, in each case
from any liability in connection with such litigation; _provided further_ ,
that the Company shall otherwise control the defense and/or settlement and the
disclosure of information in connection therewith shall be subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.1_, including regarding attorney-client privilege
or other applicable legal privilege.

  



  

6.7 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including _Section 6.2(a)_, Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary
to consummate the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) make all filings (if any) and give
all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such Party pursuant to
any Material Contract in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the
other Transactions to the extent requested in writing by Parent, (b) seek each
Consent (if any) required to be obtained pursuant to any Material Contract by
such Party in connection with the Transactions to the extent requested in
writing by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , each of the Parties acknowledges
and agrees that obtaining any such consent or approval shall not, in and of
itself, be a condition to the Offer or the Merger and (c) seek to lift
any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Offer or the Merger
brought by any third Person against such Party. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 6.7_ to the contrary, neither Parent, the Company nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any consent or other
similar fee, payment or consideration, make any other concession or provide
any additional security (including a guaranty), to obtain any third party
consents.

  



  

   

50

Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent, and
thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any further press release(s) or otherwise making any public statement
or making any announcement to Company Associates (to the extent not previously
issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer,
the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not
issue any such press release, public statement or announcement to Company
Associates without the other Party's written consent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any
public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors
or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to
employees and make disclosures in Company SEC Documents, so long as such
statements substantially reiterate (and are not inconsistent with)
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by the Parties (or individually, if approved by the other Party); (b) a Party
may, without the prior consent of the other Party but subject to giving
advance notice to the other Party and consulting with the other Party with
respect to the content thereof, issue any such press release or make any such
public announcement or statement that, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, is determined to be required by Legal Requirement; (c) the Company
need not consult with Parent in connection with such portion of any press
release, public statement or filing to be issued or made pursuant to _Section
5.3(d)_; and (d) neither Party need consult with the other in connection with
such portion of any press release, public statement or filing to be issued
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Company Adverse Change
Recommendation (but without limiting the Company's obligations under _Section
5.3_ or _Section 6.1_).

  



  

6.9 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport
to be, applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise act
to lawfully eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of
the Transactions.

prior to or as of the Offer Acceptance Time, to approve, for purposes of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the disposition and cancellation or deemed
disposition and cancellation of Shares and Company Options in the Merger by

officer, director or employee and will take all other action reasonably
necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set
forth in Rule 14d - 10 (d) (2) under the Exchange Act. Promptly upon Parent
or any of its Affiliates entering into any such arrangement with any of the
officers, directors or employees of the Company, Parent will provide to the
Company any and all information concerning such arrangements as may be needed
by the Company to comply with this _Section 6.11_.

the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from NASDAQ and the deregistration of
the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time.

  



  

6.13 401(k) Plan. To the extent requested in writing by Parent at
least 10 days prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all

required, including amendments to the Company's 401(k) plan and/or the tax-
qualified defined contribution retirement plan designated by Parent (the "
_Parent 401(k) Plan_") to permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including of loans) in the form of cash, or

54

 



    



  

8.3 Expenses; Termination Fees.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or
not the Offer and Merger are consummated.

  



  

(b) In the event that:

  



  

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)_, the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds prior to or simultaneously
with (and as a condition to the effectiveness of) such termination;

  



  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_, the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee
by wire transfer of same day funds within one business day after such
termination; or

  



  

(iii) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ (but in the case of a termination by the
Company, only if at such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating
this Agreement pursuant to the proviso to  _Section 8.1(b)_) or by Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ resulting from a willful and material breach of
any covenant in this Agreement, (y) any Person shall have publicly disclosed a
_bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, or such Acquisition Proposal has otherwise
been communicated to the Board of Directors or the Company's stockholders and
shall have become publicly known, after the date hereof and prior to such
termination and such Acquisition Proposal has not been
unconditionally withdrawn prior to such termination and (z) within twelve
(12) months of such termination the Board of Directors shall have approved or
recommended any Acquisition Proposal (regardless of when made), and the
Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal, which shall have been consummated ( _provided_ that for
purposes of this  _clause (z)_ the references to "20%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%"), the
Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of same day funds prior to the consummation of such Acquisition
Proposal.

  



  

(c) It is understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used
herein,  " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to
$160,000,000. In any circumstance in which the Termination Fee becomes due
and payable and is paid by the Company in accordance with this _Section 8.3_,
the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for, and the
sole and exclusive monetary remedy available to Parent and Purchaser in
connection with, any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (collectively, " _Parent Related Parties_ ")
(and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent,
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its
Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the
Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent and Purchaser may seek specific performance to
cause the Company to consummate the Transactions in accordance with _Section
9.5_ or the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this  _Section
8.3(c)_, but in no event shall Parent or Purchaser be entitled to both (i)
specific performance to cause the Company to consummate the Transactions in
accordance with _Section 9.5_ and (ii) the payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant to this _Section 8.3(c)_.

  



  

   

55

 



    



  

(d) Parent's right to receive payment from the Company of the
Termination Fee and any other payments pursuant to _Section 8.3_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the
Company and any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, optionholders, managers, members or
Affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Offer or the Merger to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and
upon payment of such amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions.

  



  

(e) The Parties acknowledge (i) that the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Purchaser in the

may be amended with the approval of the respective Boards of Directors of
the Company, Parent and Purchaser at any time; _provided_ that, following the

9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on
the part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right,
privilege or remedy. No single or partial exercise of any such power, right,
privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to
have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim,
power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written
instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Party and any such
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure. At any time prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive any breach of the
representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other with
any of the agreements or covenants contained herein. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if is expressly set forth in a written instrument
duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Party or Parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure. The rights and remedies provided herein shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by any Legal Requirement except
to the extent set forth in _Section 8.3(d)_.

  



  

9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other document
delivered by any Person pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger.

  



  

9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement (including its
Exhibits, Annexes and the Company Disclosure Schedule) and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or
between any of the Parties and their respective Affiliates, with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement except that the
restrictions on contact and restrictions on disclosure (to the extent to be
included in SEC filings in connection with the Transactions) in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate immediately following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement solely for purposes of permitting the actions
contemplated hereby to be consummated. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, including by facsimile or by email with .pdf
attachments, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties.

9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific
Performance; Remedies.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof. In any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue
of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom or, if (but only if) such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,
the United States District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of
Delaware and any appellate court therefrom (collectively, the " _Delaware
Courts_ "); and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of
process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in
accordance with _Section 9.9_. Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally (1) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in the Delaware Courts, (2) agrees that any claim in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Delaware Courts,
(3) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the jurisdiction or laying of
venue of any such action or proceeding in the Delaware Courts and (4) waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum
to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the Delaware Courts. The
Parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any Party's rights
to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such
final trial court judgment.

  



  

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section 9.5(a)_ without proof
of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled under this Agreement, and (ii) the right of specific
performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The
right to specific enforcement hereunder shall include the right of the
Company, on behalf of itself and any third party beneficiaries to this
Agreement, to cause Parent and Purchaser to cause the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy
at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this _Section 9.5(b)_ shall not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH PARTY (I) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND
(II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS
_SECTION 9.5_.

  



  

9.6 Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall
be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned by a
Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such
consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided further_ , _however_ , that
Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly-owned
direct or indirect Delaware corporate Subsidiary of Parent to act as
Purchaser, in which event all references to Purchaser in this Agreement shall
be deemed references to such other Subsidiary;  _provided_ such assignment
shall not impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions or relieve
Parent of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

9.7 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other
than the Parties) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement; except for: (a) if the Offer Acceptance Time
occurs, (i) the right of the Company's stockholders to receive the Offer
Price or Merger Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to _Section 1_ or
_Section 2 _following the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, as
applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) the
right of the holders of Company Options to receive the applicable treatment
pursuant to _Section 2.8 _following the Effective Time in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement; and (b) the provisions set forth in _Section
6.5 _of this Agreement with respect to the Persons referred to therein.

2.6(b)_, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
similar Taxes and fees imposed on the Company with respect to the transfer of
Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger shall be borne by the Company and
expressly shall not be a liability of holders of Shares, expressly excluding
any such Taxes imposed on the holders of Shares. The Company shall cooperate
with Purchaser and Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns
with respect to such Taxes.

  



  

9.9 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or
permitted to be delivered to any Party under this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received (a) upon
receipt when delivered by hand, (b) two business days after being sent by

by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this

the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law as so amended.

  



  

(3) Any repeal or modification of this Article SIXTH shall only be
prospective and shall not affect the rights or protections or increase the
