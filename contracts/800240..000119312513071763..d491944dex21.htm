_W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Office Depot (the " _Office Depot Board_ ")
and the Board of Directors of OfficeMax (the " _OfficeMax Board_ ") have
determined that a business combination between Office Depot and OfficeMax
presents the opportunity for their respective companies to achieve long-term
financial and strategic benefits and accordingly have determined to effect a
business combination upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Office Depot Board and the OfficeMax Board propose to effect
such business combination through the Transactions (as defined below),
following which OfficeMax Converted LLC (as defined below) will be a wholly
owned indirect subsidiary of Office Depot, and pursuant to which each share of
OfficeMax Common Stock (as defined below) outstanding at the Second Effective
Time will be converted into the right to receive a specified number of shares
of Office Depot Common Stock (as defined below) as more fully provided in this
Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the OfficeMax Board has determined that this Agreement, the
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
pursuant to which OfficeMaxs businesses would be combined with Office Depots
businesses and the holders of shares of OfficeMax Common Stock (collectively,
" _OfficeMax Stockholders_ ") would have a continuing equity interest in the
combined Office Depot and OfficeMax businesses through the ownership of shares
of Office Depot Common Stock, are advisable and in the best interests of the
OfficeMax Stockholders and, by resolutions duly adopted, has approved and
adopted this Agreement and resolved to recommend that the OfficeMax
Stockholders adopt this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the First Merger (as defined below) and the Second
Merger (as defined below);

WHEREAS, the Office Depot Board has determined that this Agreement, the

pursuant to which the holders of shares of Office Depot Common Stock
(collectively, " _Office Depot Stockholders_ ") would have a continuing equity
interest in the combined Office Depot and OfficeMax businesses through the
continued ownership of shares of Office Depot Common Stock, are advisable and
in the best interests of Office Depot and the Office Depot Stockholders and,
by resolutions duly adopted, has approved and adopted this Agreement and,
effective as of the Second Effective Time (as defined below), the Bylaw
Amendment and resolved to recommend that the Office Depot Stockholders approve
the issuance of shares of Office Depot Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement; WHEREAS, the boards of directors of each of Merger Sub Two, Mapleby Holdco and
Merger Sub One, by resolutions duly adopted, have approved and adopted this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, the parties intend that (i) the First Merger (as defined below) and
the LLC Conversion (as defined below), taken together, and (ii) the Second
Merger and the Third Merger (as defined below), taken together, will each
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the regulations
thereunder (the " _Treasury Regulations_ "), and that this Agreement be, and
be hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Section 368
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder; and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and

capital stock of OfficeMax Surviving Corporation, each issued and outstanding
share of capital stock of OfficeMax Surviving Corporation shall be converted
into one limited liability company interest of OfficeMax Converted LLC.

 



11 2.3 _Conversion of Securities in the Second Merger._ At the Second Effective
Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of
Merger Sub Two or Mapleby Holdco or their respective stockholders:

(a) each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub Two issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be converted
into one share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Mapleby Holdco Surviving
Corporation, such that immediately following the Second Effective Time, such
newly issued shares shall constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Mapleby Holdco Surviving Corporation;

 

(b) each share of OfficeMax Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Second Effective Time (other than any Excluded Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive the number of shares of Office Depot
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, together with cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, payable pursuant to Section 2.4(b) and unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, payable pursuant to Section 2.5(c); and

(c) each share of OfficeMax Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Second Effective Time held by Office Depot, Merger Sub Two or in
the treasury of OfficeMax Surviving Corporation shall be cancelled and no
payment shall be made in respect of such shares (such shares, " _Excluded
Shares_ ").

2.4 _Exchange Ratio; Fractional Shares; Adjustments._

 

(a) The " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall be equal to 2.6900, subject to adjustment
in accordance with Section 2.4(d). All calculations to be performed pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement shall be calculated to four decimal places
(0.0001).

(b) No shares representing less than one share of Office Depot Common Stock
shall be issued in the Second Merger as a result of the conversion provided
for in Section 2.3(b), but in lieu thereof each OfficeMax Stockholder
otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Office Depot Common Stock shall
be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.4(b), a cash payment in lieu of such fractional
shares representing such holders proportionate interest, if any, in the
proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of the
Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more transactions of
shares of Office Depot Common Stock equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate
number of shares of Office Depot Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange
Agent by Office Depot pursuant to Section 2.5(a) over (ii) the aggregate
number of whole shares of Office Depot Common Stock to be distributed to the
OfficeMax Stockholders pursuant to Section 2.5(b) (such excess being, the "
_Excess Shares_ "). The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately
bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Office Depot that
would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. As soon as
practicable after the Second Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for
the holders of the certificates representing shares of Office Depot Common
Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares, shall sell the Excess
Shares at then prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ")
in the manner provided in the following paragraph.

 



12 (c) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders that would otherwise receive fractional shares, shall be executed on
the NYSE at then-prevailing market prices and shall be executed in round lots
to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been
distributed to the OfficeMax Stockholders, the Exchange Agent shall hold such
proceeds in trust for the OfficeMax Stockholders (the " _Common Stock Trust_
"). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Stock Trust
to which each OfficeMax Stockholder shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying
the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Stock Trust by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such holder of shares of OfficeMax Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all OfficeMax Stockholders would otherwise
be entitled.

 

(d) In the event that, prior to the Second Effective Time, Office Depot or
OfficeMax shall declare a stock dividend or other distribution payable in
shares of Office Depot Common Stock or shares of OfficeMax Common Stock, as
applicable, or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into shares
of Office Depot Common Stock or shares of OfficeMax Common Stock, as
applicable, or effect a stock split, reclassification, combination or other
change with respect to shares of Office Depot Common Stock or shares of
OfficeMax Common Stock, as applicable, the Exchange Ratio set forth in Section
2.4(a) shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of such
dividend, distribution, stock split, reclassification, combination or other
change.

2.5 _Exchange of Shares._

(a) _Exchange Agent._ At the Second Effective Time, Office Depot shall
deposit with such exchange agent as may be mutually agreed by Office Depot and
OfficeMax (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of OfficeMax
Stockholders, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.5 and in
accordance with an exchange agent agreement with Office Depot in form and
substance reasonably approved by OfficeMax prior to the Second Effective Time,
(i) shares of Office Depot Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.3 in
exchange for outstanding shares of OfficeMax Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.4 and (ii) an amount of cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, payable pursuant to Section 2.5(c) (such
shares of Office Depot Common Stock, together with any cash for unpaid
dividends or distributions, if any, with respect thereto, are referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as practicable after the Second Effective
Time, Office Depot shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") which immediately prior to the
Second Effective Time represented outstanding shares of OfficeMax Common Stock
whose shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Office Depot
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.3(b), (i) a letter of transmittal (the form
and substance of which shall have been reasonably approved by OfficeMax prior
to the Second Effective Time and which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form
and have such other customary provisions as Office Depot may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates

 



13  in exchange for shares of Office Depot Common Stock, cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, payable pursuant to Section 2.4(b) and unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, payable pursuant to Section 2.5(c). Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate or
certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry form representing that whole
number of shares of Office Depot Common Stock which such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.3(b) in such denominations and registered in
such names as such holder may reasonably request and (B) a check representing
the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends
and distributions, if any, which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, after giving effect to
any required withholding tax. The shares represented by the Certificate so
surrendered shall be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.5, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Second
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender whole
shares of Office Depot Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if
any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, as provided in this
Article II, after giving effect to any required withholding tax. Office Depot,
without any action on the part of any holder, shall cause the Exchange Agent
to (x) issue, as of the Second Effective Time, to each holder of
uncertificated shares of OfficeMax Common Stock (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ")
that number of whole shares of Office Depot Common Stock that the holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.3(b) and cancel such Book-Entry
Shares and (y) mail to each holder of Book-Entry Shares a check representing
the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends
and distributions, if any, as provided in this Article II, after giving
effect to any required withholding tax. Office Depot shall also cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each such holder of Book-Entry Shares materials (in
a form to be reasonably agreed by Office Depot and OfficeMax prior to the
Second Effective Time) advising such holder of the effectiveness of the
Second Merger and the conversion of such holders Book-Entry Shares pursuant
to the Second Merger. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu
of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any,
payable to OfficeMax Stockholders. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
shares of OfficeMax Common Stock that is not registered on the transfer
records of OfficeMax, the proper number of shares of Office Depot Common
Stock, together with a check for the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional
shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, may be issued
to such transferee if all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid and, with respect to shares of OfficeMax Common Stock represented by
a Certificate, the Certificate held by such transferee are presented to the
Exchange Agent. 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ Whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
respect to shares of Office Depot Common Stock with a record date after the
Second Effective Time, such declaration shall include a dividend or other
distribution in respect of all shares of Office Depot Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Second Effective Time with respect to shares of Office Depot Common Stock
having a record date after the Second Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder, until the holder shall
surrender such Certificate as provided in this Section 2.5. Subject to the
effect of Applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid to the holder of the

 



14  certificates representing whole shares of Office Depot Common Stock issued
in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Second Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of
Office Depot Common Stock and not paid, less the amount of any withholding
taxes which may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date
subsequent to surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Second Effective Time but prior to surrender and a
payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Office Depot Common Stock, less the amount of any withholding taxes
which may be required thereon.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in OfficeMax Common Stock._ All shares of
Office Depot Common Stock issued upon surrender of Certificates or
cancellation of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (including any cash paid pursuant to this Article II) shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of OfficeMax Common Stock represented by such Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of OfficeMax of shares of OfficeMax Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time. If, after the
Second Effective Time, Certificates are presented to OfficeMax Surviving LLC
or OfficeMax Converted LLC for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Certificates and Book-Entry Shares to be
exchanged by any Person constituting an "affiliate" of OfficeMax for purposes
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the
rules and regulations thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "), shall be subject
to the restrictions described in such Rule 145.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to OfficeMax Stockholders six months after the date of
the mailing required by Section 2.5(b) shall be delivered to Office Depot,
upon demand. Upon surrender of Certificates previously representing shares of
OfficeMax Common Stock to OfficeMax Surviving LLC, OfficeMax Converted LLC or
Office Depot by OfficeMax Stockholders who have not complied with this Section
2.5 prior to such date, such Certificates shall be cancelled and exchanged by
Office Depot for certificates representing shares of Office Depot Common
Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, payable pursuant to Section
2.4(b) and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable pursuant
to Section 2.5(c).

(f) _No Liability._ None of Office Depot, OfficeMax Surviving LLC, OfficeMax
Converted LLC or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect
of any shares of OfficeMax Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the
Second Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
cash, any cash in lieu of fractional shares or any dividends or distributions
with respect to whole shares of OfficeMax Common Stock in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority), any such cash, dividends or distributions in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
become the property of Office Depot, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



15 (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Office Depot, on a daily basis,
_provided_ , that no such investment or losses will affect the cash payable to
former holders of OfficeMax Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Office Depot upon termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant
to Section 2.5(e).

2.6 _Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards._

(a) As of the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase
shares of OfficeMax Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Second Effective Time (each, an "O _fficeMax Option_ ") shall be converted
into an option (an "O _ffice Depot Exchange Option_ ") to purchase, on the
same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements) as
applied to each such OfficeMax Option immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time, the number of whole shares of Office Depot Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) that is equal to the number of
shares of OfficeMax Common Stock subject to such OfficeMax Option immediately
prior to the Second Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, at an
exercise price per share of Office Depot Common Stock (rounded up to the
nearest whole penny) equal to the exercise price for each such share of
OfficeMax Common Stock subject to such OfficeMax Option immediately prior to
the Second Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that in
the case of any OfficeMax Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies as
of the Second Effective Time by reason of its qualification under Section 422
of the Code, the exercise price, the number of shares of Office Depot Common
Stock subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such
option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code.

(b) At the Second Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or
accrued, to receive shares of OfficeMax Common Stock or benefits measured in
whole or in part by the value of a number of shares of OfficeMax Common Stock
granted by OfficeMax (including restricted stock, restricted stock units,
phantom units, deferred stock units, stock equivalents and dividend
equivalents), other than OfficeMax Options (each, other than OfficeMax
Options, an "O _fficeMax Stock-Based Award_ "), shall, by virtue of the Second
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into an award, on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting
requirements and deferral provisions) as applied to each such OfficeMax Stock-
Based Award immediately prior to the Second Effective Time, with respect to
the number of shares of Office Depot Common Stock that is equal to the number
of shares of OfficeMax Common Stock subject to the OfficeMax Stock-Based Award
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share) ( an "O _ffice Depot Exchange
Stock-Based Award_ "); _provided_ that any then outstanding awards that vest
based on the attainment of performance goals with a performance period that
has not completed prior to the Closing Date shall be converted at the Second
Effective Time into time-based awards that shall vest at target levels at the
originally scheduled vesting date, subject to any accelerated vesting upon a
qualifying termination of employment in accordance with the terms of the 2003
OfficeMax Incentive and Performance Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
shares of OfficeMax Common Stock issued in connection with the settlement of
OfficeMax Stock-Based Awards which vest on or prior to the Second Effective
Time shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 2.3(b).

 



16 (c) Prior to the Second Effective Time, OfficeMax, Office Depot and their
respective boards of directors and compensation committees, as applicable,
shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section
2.6.

(d) Office Depot agrees to use its reasonable efforts to file with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") within five
business days after the Closing Date a registration statement on Form S-8 or
other appropriate form under the Securities Act to register shares of Office
Depot Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Office Depot Exchange Options
and settlement of Office Depot Exchange Stock-Based Awards and use its
reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to remain effective
until the exercise or expiration of such Office Depot Exchange Options and the
settlement of such Office Depot Exchange Stock-Based Awards.

Time, by virtue of the Third Merger and without any action on the part of
Merger Sub Three or Mapleby Holdco Surviving Corporation or their respective
stockholders or members:

17  which the nature of the business conducted by it or the property it owns,

certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated, as in effect on the
date of this Agreement (the " _Office Depot Charter_ "). Except as would not

combination with another event, will result in, cause the accelerated
vesting, funding of any amounts to a rabbi trust or delivery of, or increase
the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer,

including any employee welfare plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of
ERISA, any employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of

that OfficeMax Plans shall not include any OfficeMax Foreign Plan or any
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "
_Multiemployer Plan_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _OfficeMax
Foreign Plan_ " shall refer to each material plan, program or contract that
is subject to or governed by the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
United States, and which would have been treated as an OfficeMax Plan had it
been a United States plan, program or contract. With respect to each material
OfficeMax Plan and each material OfficeMax Foreign Plan, OfficeMax has
provided or made available to Office Depot a true, correct and complete copy
of the following (where applicable): (i) each writing constituting a part of

undertaken to make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any material new
OfficeMax Plan or new OfficeMax Foreign Plan.

 



42 (b) With respect to each OfficeMax Plan that is intended to be a "qualified
plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (" _Qualified
OfficeMax Plans_ "), the Internal Revenue Service has issued a favorable
determination letter with respect to such Qualified OfficeMax Plan and the
related trust that has not been revoked, and no circumstances exist and no
events have occurred that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any Qualified OfficeMax Plan or the related trust.

 

(c) All contributions required to be made to any OfficeMax Plan by Applicable
Law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all
premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
OfficeMax Plan, before the date of this Agreement have been made or paid in
full in all material respects on or before the final due date thereof. 

(d) OfficeMax and its subsidiaries have complied, and are now in compliance,
in all material respects, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws
and regulations applicable to the OfficeMax Plans. Each OfficeMax Plan has
been operated in material compliance with its terms. There is not now, and
there are no existing circumstances that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect to an
OfficeMax Plan or the imposition of any lien on the assets of OfficeMax or any
of its subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code.

 

(e) With respect to each OfficeMax Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section
302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code: (i) there has been no (A)
failure by OfficeMax or any of its subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates to make by
its due date a required installment under Section 430(j) of the Code or any
failure by any such OfficeMax Plan to satisfy the minimum funding standards
(within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA)
applicable to such OfficeMax Plan, whether or not waived or (B) determination
that any such OfficeMax Plan is, or is expected to be, in "at risk" status
(within the meaning of Section 430 of the Code or Section 303 of ERISA); (ii)
the fair market value of the assets of such OfficeMax Plan equals or exceeds
the actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under such OfficeMax Plan
(whether or not vested) on a termination basis; (iii) no reportable event
within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice
requirement has not been waived has occurred, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the occurrence
of any such reportable event; (iv) all premiums to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ") have been timely paid in full; (v) no
liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has
been or is expected to be incurred by the OfficeMax or any of its
subsidiaries; and (vi) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate
any such OfficeMax Plan and, to OfficeMaxs knowledge, no condition exists
that reasonably could be expected to present a risk that such proceedings will
be instituted or which would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA
for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any
such OfficeMax Plan.

(f) Neither OfficeMax nor any of its subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates is
obligated to contribute currently or has been obligated to contribute during

Affiliates following the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, neither OfficeMax nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has engaged in any transaction described in
Section 4069 or Section 4204 of ERISA.

(h) Except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of
the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, neither OfficeMax nor any of its
subsidiaries has any material liability for life, health, medical or other
welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof.

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either alone or in
combination with another event, will result in, cause the accelerated vesting,
funding of any amounts to a rabbi trust or delivery of, or increase the
amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer, director
or consultant of OfficeMax or any of its subsidiaries. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable by OfficeMax or any of
its subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other events will be an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Prior to
the date hereof, OfficeMax has amended, or caused to be amended, the OfficeMax
Deferred Compensation and Benefits Trust (as amended and restated as of
November 1, 2011, the " _OfficeMax DCB Trust_ ") and any other OfficeMax
Plan, as applicable, such that no amounts shall be required to be funded to
the OfficeMax DCB Trust or any other trust or similar funding instrument
relating to any such OfficeMax Plan (excluding trusts with respect to tax-
qualified, registered or similar retirement plans and, for the avoidance of
doubt, trusts with respect to indemnification agreements described in Section
6.2 of the OfficeMax Disclosure Schedule) in connection with the execution of
this Agreement, the public announcement or consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein or for any other reason prior to the earlier of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement. Prior to the date hereof,
OfficeMax has amended, or caused to be amended, the OfficeMax 2001 Key

other OfficeMax Plan shall not be credited with any increased interest rate in
connection with the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated herein or for any other
reason prior to the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement.

(j) There are no pending or to the knowledge of OfficeMax threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted against the OfficeMax
Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the OfficeMax
Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the OfficeMax Plans
which would result in any material liability of OfficeMax or any of its
subsidiaries to the PBGC, the United States Department of Treasury, the
United States Department of Labor or any Multiemployer Plan.

 



44 (k) Neither OfficeMax nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by,

other assistance, as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Registration Statement and the
Joint Proxy Statement. The Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration
Statement shall include all information reasonably requested by such other
party to be included therein. Each of Office Depot and OfficeMax shall, as
promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof, provide the other party
with copies of any written comments and advise the other party of any oral
comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration
Statement received from the Commission, including any request from the
Commission for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or
Joint Proxy Statement, and shall provide the other with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
Commission, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing
the Registration Statement or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement or responding
to any comments of the Commission with respect thereto, each of Office Depot
and OfficeMax (i) shall provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final

shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or
suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Office Depot shall also
use its reasonable best efforts to take any other action (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified
on the date of this Agreement) required to be taken under any applicable
securities laws, rules or regulations in connection with the Transactions, the
issuance of shares of Office Depot Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and
the treatment of OfficeMax Options and OfficeMax Stock-Based Awards pursuant
to Section 2.6, and OfficeMax shall furnish all information concerning
OfficeMax and the holders of OfficeMax Common Stock, OfficeMax Options and
OfficeMax Stock-Based Awards as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action.

(c) If, at any time prior to the Second Effective Time, either party obtains
knowledge of any information pertaining to it or previously provided by it for
inclusion in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement that
would require any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or
the Joint Proxy Statement so that any of such documents would not include any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, such party shall
promptly advise the other party and Office Depot and OfficeMax shall cooperate
in the prompt filing with the Commission of any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and,
as required by Applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained in
such amendment or supplement to the Office Depot Stockholders and the
OfficeMax Stockholders.

Stockholders (the " _Office Depot Stockholders Meeting_ ") for purposes of

Proxy Statement to be distributed to the Office Depot Stockholders. Without
the prior written consent of OfficeMax, no proposals other than the Office
Depot Stockholder Approval and routine proposals required in connection with
such approval shall be included in the Joint Proxy Statement or transacted at
the Office Depot Stockholders Meeting. Unless the Office Depot Board shall
have made an Office Depot Change of Recommendation as permitted by Section
6.10(e) or Section 6.10(f), Office Depot shall use its reasonable best efforts
to solicit the Office Depot Stockholder Approval and shall include the Office
Depot Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement. Office Depot agrees
that, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section

the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
Office Depot of any Office Depot Acquisition Proposal or by the effecting of
an Office Depot Change of Recommendation by the Office Depot Board.

 

(e) OfficeMax shall, as soon as practicable following the date the

call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the OfficeMax
Stockholders (the " _OfficeMax Stockholders Meeting_ ") for purposes of
obtaining the OfficeMax Stockholder Approval and (ii) in furtherance thereof,
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be
distributed to the OfficeMax Stockholders. Without the prior written consent
of Office Depot, no proposals other than the OfficeMax Stockholder Approval
and routine proposals required in connection with such approval shall be
included in the Joint Proxy Statement or transacted at the OfficeMax
Stockholders Meeting. Unless the OfficeMax Board shall have made an OfficeMax
Change of Recommendation as permitted by Section 6.11(e) or Section 6.11(f),
OfficeMax shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the OfficeMax
Stockholder Approval and shall include the OfficeMax Board Recommendation in
the Joint Proxy Statement. OfficeMax agrees that, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, its obligations pursuant to
this Section 5.1 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to OfficeMax of any OfficeMax Acquisition
Proposal or by the effecting of an OfficeMax Change of Recommendation by the
Office Depot Board.

(f) Office Depot and OfficeMax shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Office Depot Stockholders Meeting and the OfficeMax Stockholders

of OfficeMax and Office Depot shall, and shall cause each of its respective
subsidiaries to, permit the other and its Representatives during the period
prior to the Second Effective Time to have reasonable access for reasonable
purposes related to the consummation of the Transactions and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, during normal business
times and upon reasonable advance written notice, to the other partys
premises, properties, books, records, contracts and documents. Information

50 5.3 _Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification._

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable and in any event prior to the End Date, the Transactions and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining
of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, licenses, permits,
authorizations, orders and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the
making of all other necessary registrations and filings, (ii) the obtaining of
all consents, approvals or waivers from third parties related to or required
in connection with the Transactions that are necessary or desirable in
connection with the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and material to the business of Office Depot or OfficeMax, as
the case may be, (iii) the preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement, including the Prospectus, (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate any of the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement and (v) the providing of all such information concerning such
party, its subsidiaries, its affiliates and its subsidiaries and affiliates
officers, directors, employees and partners as may reasonably be requested
in connection with any of the matters set forth in this Section 5.3.

(b) Each of Office Depot and OfficeMax shall (A) make or cause to be made the
filings required of such party or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates under
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten business days after the
date of this Agreement), (B) make or cause to be made such other filings as
are required under Applicable Law in foreign jurisdictions governing antitrust
or merger control matters with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, (C) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request for
additional information, documents or other materials received by such party
or any of its subsidiaries from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department
of Justice or any other Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Laws and (D) cooperate in good faith with the other party in
obtaining all approvals required under applicable Antitrust Laws and in
connection with any such filing (including, with respect to the party making a
filing, providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its
advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to accept all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in
connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any such
agency or other Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Laws with respect
to any such filing or any such transaction. Each party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for
any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any Applicable Law in
connection with the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each party shall give the other party to this Agreement
reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed
understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Authority
regarding any such filings or any such transaction. Neither party shall
independently participate in any formal meeting, or engage in any substantive
conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings,

 



51  investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party reasonable
prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend any such meeting or
participate in any such conversation. The parties will consult and cooperate
with one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party in connection with proceedings under or relating to the
HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. Neither party will directly or indirectly
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with
a Governmental Authority related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement except with the prior written consent of the
other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Each party shall promptly furnish the other party with copies of
all correspondence, filings and written communications between them and their
affiliates and their respective representatives on one hand, and any such
Governmental Authority or its respective staff on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except that any materials concerning one partys valuation of the other party
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any partys internal
financial information, may be redacted. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 5.3(b) to the contrary, each party shall have the right to designate
any information provided to the other party as subject to review by a clean
team only pursuant to and in accordance with the Clean Team Agreement.

(c) Subject to Section 5.3(d), each of Office Depot and OfficeMax shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other federal, state or foreign statues, rules, regulations,
orders, decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust
Laws_ "). In connection therewith and subject to Section 5.3(d), if any Action
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of
Office Depot and OfficeMax shall cooperate to vigorously contest and resist
any such Action (through negotiation, litigation or otherwise), including any
legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent (each an " _Order_ "), that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts consummation of the
Transactions or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal and all available legislative action. Each of Office Depot and
OfficeMax shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be
required to cause the expiration or termination of the waiting periods under
the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as
promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Office
Depot nor OfficeMax shall be required to divest, hold separate (including by
trust or otherwise) or otherwise commit to take any action that limits Office
Depots or OfficeMaxs freedom of action with respect to its respective
ability to retain or operate any of its businesses, services or assets;
_provided_ , _however_ , that unless each of Office Depot and OfficeMax
otherwise agree, if (i) necessary to avoid the Federal Trade Commission or the
Department of Justice instituting an Action challenging the transactions under
this Agreement under the Antitrust Laws and seeking 

 



52  an Order or (ii) necessary to avoid any other Governmental Authority
instituting an Action challenging the transactions under this Agreement under
the Antitrust Laws and seeking an Order, then Office Depot and OfficeMax
shall agree collectively to divest or hold separate (including by trust or
otherwise) or otherwise take any action that limits Office Depots or
OfficeMaxs freedom of action with respect to its respective ability to
retain or operate any of its businesses, services or assets, except to the
extent such action would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect after the Closing on the combined businesses of Office Depot, OfficeMax
Converted LLC and their subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including the overall
benefits expected, as of the date of this Agreement, to be derived by the
parties from the combination of Office Depot and OfficeMax via the
Transactions; and _provided further_ , _however_ , that neither Office Depot
or OfficeMax shall agree, without the others prior written consent, to divest
or hold separate or take any action to the extent not required by the
foregoing proviso. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, neither party shall be required to (A) waive
any of the conditions set forth in Article VII of this Agreement as they apply
to such party or (B) divest, hold separate or take or agree to take any
action or agree to any limitation that limits its freedom of action with
respect to its ability to retain or operate any of its businesses, services or
assets unless such actions are conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing
or are effective on or after the Closing.

5.4 _Control of Other Party s Business._ Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Office Depot, directly or indirectly, the right to control
OfficeMax or any of OfficeMaxs subsidiaries or direct the business or
operations of OfficeMax or any of OfficeMaxs subsidiaries prior to the
Second Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement shall give OfficeMax,
directly or indirectly, the right to control Office Depot or any of Office
Depots subsidiaries or direct the business or operations of Office Depot or
any of Office Depots subsidiaries prior to the Second Effective Time. Prior
to the Second Effective Time, each of Office Depot and OfficeMax shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its respective operations and the operations of
its respective subsidiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, including any of the
actions, rights or restrictions set forth herein, shall be interpreted in such
a way as to place Office Depot or OfficeMax in violation of any rule,
regulation or policy of any Governmental Authority or Applicable Law.

5.5 _Tax-Free Treatment._ Each of the parties shall, and shall cause each of
its respective subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause each
of (a) the First Merger and the LLC Conversion, taken together, and (b) the
Second Merger and the Third Merger, taken together, to constitute a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code and to cooperate with one
another in obtaining an opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP,
counsel to OfficeMax (" _OfficeMax s Counsel_"), as provided for in Section
7.2(d), and an opinion from Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, counsel to Office
Depot (" _Office Depot s Counsel_"), as provided for in Section 7.3(d). In
connection therewith, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
deliver to OfficeMaxs Counsel and Office Depots Counsel representation
letters, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
OfficeMaxs Counsel (in the case of representation letters delivered in
connection with the opinion provided for in Section 7.2(d)) and Office Depots
Counsel (in the case of representation letters delivered in connection with
the opinion provided for in Section 7.3(d)). Each representation letter shall
be dated as of the Closing Date or such time or times as may be reasonably
requested by OfficeMaxs Counsel and Office Depots Counsel. None of the
parties and none of their subsidiaries shall take or fail to take any action
which action (or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to cause either
(i) the First Merger and the LLC Conversion, taken together, or (ii)
the Second Merger and the Third Merger, taken together, to fail to qualify as
a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



53 5.6 _Public Announcements._ The initial press release concerning the
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be a joint press release. Except (a) as required by Applicable Law or
requirements of the NYSE (and in that event only if time does not permit) or
(b) with respect to any Office Depot Change of Recommendation or any
OfficeMax Change of Recommendation or any action taken by Office Depot or the
Office Depot Board or OfficeMax or the OfficeMax Board, as applicable,
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 6.10 or Section 6.11, as
applicable, at all times prior to the earlier of the Closing or termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, Office Depot and OfficeMax shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or other public
statement or comment with respect to the Transactions and any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press
release or make such other public statement or comment prior to such
consultation. 

5.7 _Section 16 Matters. _Prior to the Closing, each of Office Depot and
OfficeMax shall use all reasonable efforts to approve in advance in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP SEC No-Action
Letter (January 12, 1999) any dispositions of shares of OfficeMax Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to OfficeMax Common Stock)
or acquisitions of shares of Office Depot Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to shares of Office Depot Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
officer or director of Office Depot or OfficeMax who is subject to Section 16
of the Exchange Act (or who will become subject to Section 16 of the Exchange
Act as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby) with respect to
equity securities of Office Depot or OfficeMax.

5.8 _Transaction Litigation._ Office Depot shall give OfficeMax the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against Office Depot or its directors relating to the Transactions
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of OfficeMax,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
OfficeMax shall give Office Depot the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against OfficeMax or its
directors relating to the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior
written consent of Office Depot, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. For purposes of this paragraph,
"participate" means that the non-litigating party will be kept apprised of
proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the
litigation by the litigating party (to the extent the attorney-client
privilege between the litigating party and its counsel is not undermined or
otherwise affected), and the non-litigating party may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to the litigation but will not be afforded any
decision making power or other authority over the litigation except for the
settlement consent set forth above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 5.8, no settlement of any Action requiring any payment or
admission of wrongdoing by any Office Depot director or any OfficeMax director
shall be agreed to without such directors prior written consent.

 



54 5.9 _Notification of Certain Matters._

with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or

prior to the End Date; in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above solely if
such breach or failure would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b); _provided, however_ , that
a failure to comply with this Section 5.9(a) will not constitute the failure
of any condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b) to be satisfied unless the
underlying inaccuracy or breach would independently result in the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b) to be satisfied; and _provided,

or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement and (iii) any Events that, individually

prior to the End Date; in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above solely if
such breach or failure would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or (b); _provided, however_ , that
a failure to comply with this Section 5.9(b) will not constitute the failure
of any condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or (b) to be satisfied unless the
underlying inaccuracy or breach would independently result in the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or (b) to be satisfied; and _provided,
further_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.9(b)
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available under this

6.3 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance._

 

(a) From and after the Second Effective Time, Office Depot shall cause
(including, to the extent required, providing sufficient funding to enable
OfficeMax Converted LLC to satisfy all of its obligations under this Section
6.3(a)) OfficeMax Converted LLC to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and
provide advancement of expenses to, the present and former officers and
directors of OfficeMax against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
liabilities or judgments that are paid in settlement of or in connection with
any Action based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of
the fact that such Person is or was an officer or director of OfficeMax prior
to the Second Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or
after, the Second Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) to the fullest extent provided or permitted
under the OfficeMax Charter, the OfficeMax Bylaws and any indemnification
agreement entered into between OfficeMax and such Person (representative
forms of which have been made available to Office Depot prior to the date of
this Agreement), in each case as in effect as of the date of this Agreement,
and under Applicable Law.

 

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Office Depot shall purchase a "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policy for OfficeMaxs present
and former directors and officers who are covered prior to the Second
Effective Time by the directors and officers liability insurance currently
maintained by OfficeMax with coverage for six years following the Second
Effective Time, and with coverage and amounts and terms and conditions no less
favorable to the covered persons than the existing policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by OfficeMax. Office Depot shall
maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

(c) Office Depot covenants and agrees from and after the Second Effective
Time to provide to the directors and officers of OfficeMax who become
directors or officers of Office Depot directors and officers liability
insurance on the same basis and to the same extent as that, if any, provided
to other directors or officers of Office Depot.

(d) If Office Depot, OfficeMax Converted LLC or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties or assets to any Person, then, in each case, Office Depot,
OfficeMax Converted LLC or any of their respective successors and assigns, as
applicable, shall take such action as may be necessary so that such
Person shall assume all of the applicable obligations set forth in this
Section 6.3.

 



62 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.3 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each present and former director and officer
referred to in this Section 6.3 and his or her heirs and representatives, and
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

6.4 _Activities of Parties Other Than Office Depot and OfficeMax. _ Prior to
the First Effective Time, Mapleby Holdco and Merger Sub One shall not conduct
any business or make any investments other than as specifically contemplated
by this Agreement and will not have any assets (other than, if applicable, a 
_de minimis_ amount of cash paid for the issuance of equity in connection with
its initial formation) or any material liabilities. Prior to the Second
Effective Time, Merger Sub Two shall not conduct any business or make any
investments other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement and
will not have any assets (other than, if applicable, a _de minimis_ amount of
cash paid for the issuance of equity in connection with its initial formation)
or any material liabilities. Prior to the Third Effective Time, Merger Sub
Three shall not conduct any business or make any investments other than as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement and will not have any assets
(other than, if applicable, a _de minimis_ amount of cash paid for the
issuance of equity in connection with its initial formation) or any material
liabilities.

6.5 _NYSE Listing._ Office Depot shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Office Depot Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
Agreement (including the shares of Office Depot Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of the Office Depot Exchange Options) to be approved for listing on
the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing.

6.6  _Employees and Employee Benefits._

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing, Office Depot shall, or
shall cause OfficeMax Converted LLC to, provide the employees of OfficeMax
and its subsidiaries as of the Closing (the " _OfficeMax Employees_ "), other
than such employees covered by collective bargaining or other labor agreements
(the " _Excluded Employees_ "), with compensation and employee benefits
plans, programs and arrangements (excluding equity-based compensation
arrangements) that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those
provided to OfficeMax Employees (other than Excluded Employees) as of
immediately prior to the Closing and shall provide equity-based compensation
awards to OfficeMax Employees (other than Excluded Employees) that are no less
favorable than those provided to similarly situated Office Depot employees.
The foregoing notwithstanding, Office Depot agrees to honor, or to cause
OfficeMax Converted LLC to honor, in accordance with their terms all OfficeMax
Plans and OfficeMax Foreign Plans and all collective bargaining agreements to
which OfficeMax or any of its subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound,
_provided_ that such plans or agreements may be amended, terminated or
suspended in accordance with their terms and Applicable Law. OfficeMax shall,
or shall cause any of its applicable subsidiaries to, comply with all notice
and consultation provisions of all collective bargaining or other labor
agreements to which it or such subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound, to
the extent required by any such collective bargaining or other labor
agreements or Applicable Law.

 



63 (b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans providing
benefits to any OfficeMax Employees after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "),
each OfficeMax Employee shall be credited with his years of service with
OfficeMax and its subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the
Closing, to the same extent as such OfficeMax Employee was entitled, before
the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar OfficeMax employee
benefit plan in which such OfficeMax Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Closing (such plans, collectively, the "
_Old Plans_ "), provided that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period
of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(A) each OfficeMax Employee who ceases to be eligible to participate in an
Old Plan shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any corresponding New Plan to the extent coverage under such New Plan
is comparable and intended to replace the benefits under any such Old
Plan, and (B) for purposes of any New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any OfficeMax Employee, Office Depot
shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old
Plans, and Office Depot shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of
the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Office
Depot or OfficeMax Converted LLC to continue (or resume) the employment of
any specific person.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.7, no provision of
this Section 6.6 shall be construed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any employee, officer, current or former director or consultant of
OfficeMax or its subsidiaries, or any beneficiary of such employee, officer,
director or consultant under an OfficeMax Plan or OfficeMax Foreign Plan or
otherwise, and is not intended to constitute an amendment to any OfficeMax
Plan or any OfficeMax Foreign Plan.

6.7 _Treatment of Office Depot Preferred Stock._ __ Prior to the Closing,
without OfficeMaxs prior written consent, Office Depot shall not agree to nor
permit any amendment, modification, supplement or waiver of any of the Office
Depot Preferred Stock Agreements.

6.8 _Treatment of OfficeMax Series D Preferred Stock._ Prior to the Closing,
OfficeMax and the OfficeMax Board shall take all actions necessary pursuant to
the OfficeMax Charter, including the Certificate of Designation of the
OfficeMax Series D Preferred Stock (the " _Certificate of Designation_ "), to
redeem all of the issued and outstanding shares of OfficeMax Series D
Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms of Section 6 of the Certificate
of

 



64  Designation (excluding any shares of OfficeMax Series D Preferred Stock
surrendered by the holder thereof for conversion in accordance with the terms
of Section 5 of the Certificate of Designation, which shares shall be
converted to OfficeMax Common Stock prior to the Second Effective Time in
accordance therewith), so as to cause (i) all of the OfficeMax Series D
Preferred Stock to be no longer outstanding and to be of no further force and
effect prior to the Second Effective Time and (ii) all of the shares of
OfficeMax Common Stock issued in exchange for the outstanding shares of
OfficeMax Series D Preferred Stock to be exchanged for shares of Office
Depot Common Stock in the Second Merger.

6.9 _Financing._ The parties shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain any term loan or revolving credit facility necessary to
fund Office Depots or OfficeMax Converted LLCs working capital needs from
and after the Closing (it being understood that obtaining such financing is
not a condition to the parties obligations to consummate any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), including providing and causing
their respective subsidiaries to provide, and using reasonable efforts to
cause their Representatives to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested
by the other party in connection with obtaining any such financing (
_provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the parties and their respective subsidiaries
and _provided_ that none of the parties or any of their respective
subsidiaries shall be required to enter into any agreements in connection
therewith that would be binding if the Closing does not occur). Each party
shall, to the extent it is aware of any applicable developments, promptly
update any information provided by it for use in an offering document to be
used in connection with any such financing to the extent such information
would otherwise contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. Each party consents to the reasonable use, prior to
the termination of this Agreement, of its and its subsidiaries logos in
connection with any such financing in a manner customary for such financing
transactions; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended to nor is reasonably likely to harm or disparage such party in
any way. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall have any obligation
under this Section 6.9 at any time that the other party is in breach of or
default under any covenant, obligation or agreement required to be performed
or complied with by it under this Agreement if such breach or default would
reasonably be expected to prevent the Transactions from being completed on or
prior to the End Date.

 

6.10 _Office Depot Acquisition Proposals._

(a) Subject to Section 6.10(c) through Section 6.10(f), Office Depot agrees
that, from the date of this Agreement until the Closing or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, neither it nor
any of its subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries directors, officers, employees,
agents, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives
(" _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate or
solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries with respect to, or the making
of, an Office Depot Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to any Person
relating to, an Office Depot Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend,
or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Office Depot Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other
similar agreement relating to any Office Depot Acquisition Proposal (each an
"O _ffice Depot Acquisition Agreement_ "), (v) amend or modify, or exempt any
Person from the operation of, the Office Depot Rights Agreement, or (vi)
propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing relating to any Office
Depot Acquisition Proposal.

 



65 (b) Subject to Section 6.10(c) through Section 6.10(f), prior to the
Closing, neither the Office Depot Board nor any committee thereof shall,
directly or indirectly, (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or publicly propose
to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to OfficeMax, the Office
Depot Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any Office Depot Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) in the event of the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer for
any outstanding shares of Office Depots capital stock, fail to recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Office Depot
Stockholders within ten business days of the commencement thereof (for the
avoidance of doubt, the taking of no position or a neutral position by the
Office Depot Board in respect of the acceptance of any tender offer or
exchange offer by the Office Depot Stockholders as of the end of the ten
business day period shall constitute a failure to recommend against any such
offer), or (iv) recommend that the Office Depot Stockholders not approve the
issuance of shares of Office Depot Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement
(any action described in clauses (i)-(iv) above being referred to as an "O
_ffice Depot Change of Recommendation_ ").

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Office Depot or the
Office Depot Board from complying with its disclosure obligations under Rule
14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such disclosure has the effect of an Office Depot Change
of Recommendation, OfficeMax shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
to the extent set forth in Section 8.1(e).

(d) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 6.10(a) and Section
6.10(b), until the earlier of receipt of the Office Depot Stockholder Approval
and any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, if after the
date of this Agreement Office Depot receives a written unsolicited bona fide
Office Depot Acquisition Proposal that the Office Depot Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors (i) constitutes an Office Depot Superior Proposal or (ii) could
reasonably be expected to result in an Office Depot Superior Proposal, then
Office Depot may take the following actions: (A) furnish nonpublic information
to the third party making such Office Depot Acquisition Proposal, if, and
only if, prior to furnishing such information, Office Depot receives from the
third party an executed confidentiality agreement with provisions no less
restrictive to such third party with respect to the use or disclosure of
nonpublic information than the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) engage in
discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to such Office
Depot Acquisition Proposal.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent Office Depot or the Office Depot
Board from, at any time prior to, but not after, the time of the receipt of
the Office Depot Stockholder Approval, in response to the receipt of a written
unsolicited bona fide Office Depot Acquisition Proposal after the date of
this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.10, (i)
terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) in order to enter into a
definitive written agreement with respect to such Office Depot Acquisition
Proposal or (ii) effecting an Office Depot Change

 



66  of Recommendation, if, prior to taking any of the actions described in
clauses (i) or (ii), (A) the Office Depot Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that (x) failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Office Depot directors fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law and (y) such Office Depot Acquisition Proposal (in the form,
other than immaterial changes, that was the subject of the Superior Proposal
Notice) constitutes an Office Depot Superior Proposal, (B) OfficeMax shall
have received written notice (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") of Office
Depots intention to take such action at least four business days prior to the
taking of such action by Office Depot and (C) the Office Depot Board continues
to believe, after taking into account any modifications to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are offered by OfficeMax
after its receipt of the Superior Proposal Notice, that such Office Depot
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute an Office Depot Superior
Proposal.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Office Depot Board from, at any
time prior to, but not after, the time of the receipt of the Office Depot
Stockholder Approval, effecting an Office Depot Change of Recommendation
(other than in response to the receipt of a written unsolicited bona fide
Office Depot Acquisition Proposal, which shall be subject to Section 6.10(e))
if, prior to taking such action, the Office Depot Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the Office Depot directors
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided, however_ that (i) OfficeMax
shall have received written notice (a " _Board Recommendation Notice_ " ) of
the Office Depot Boards intention to take any such action at least four
business days prior to the taking of such action by the Office Depot Board and
(ii) the Office Depot Board continues to believe, after taking into account
any modifications to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that are offered by OfficeMax after its receipt of such Board
Recommendation Notice that failing to take such action would be inconsistent
with the Office Depot directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

(g) Office Depot agrees that it and its subsidiaries will (i) immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than the parties) conducted prior to the
date of this Agreement with respect to any Office Depot Acquisition
Proposal and (ii) request each third party that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement that relates to an Office Depot Acquisition Proposal
(other than OfficeMax) to return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such third party by Office Depot or on its behalf.
Office Depot agrees that it and its subsidiaries will take the necessary steps
to promptly inform its and its subsidiaries Representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 6.10.

(h) From and after the date of this Agreement, Office Depot shall promptly
orally notify OfficeMax of any request for information or any inquiries,
proposals or offers relating to an Office Depot Acquisition Proposal
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person making
such request, inquiry, proposal or offer and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers and Office Depot shall provide to
OfficeMax written notice of any such inquiry, proposal or offer within 48
hours of such event and copies of any written or electronic correspondence to
or from any Person making an Office Depot Acquisition Proposal. Office Depot
shall keep OfficeMax informed orally, as soon as is reasonably practicable, of

67  any such proposal or offer and whether any such proposal or offer has been
withdrawn or rejected and Office Depot shall provide to OfficeMax written
notice of any such withdrawal or rejection and copies of any written
proposals or requests for information within 48 hours. Office Depot also
agrees to provide any information to OfficeMax (not previously provided to

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Office Depot Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer made by
any Person other than OfficeMax or its subsidiaries with respect to (A) a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving
Office Depot, (B) any purchase of an equity interest (including by means of a
tender or exchange offer) representing an amount equal to or greater than a
15% voting or economic interest in Office Depot or (C) any purchase of assets,
securities or ownership interests representing an amount equal to or greater
than 15% of the consolidated assets (including stock of the subsidiaries of
Office Depot), consolidated net revenues or earnings before interest, Taxes,
depreciation and amortization of Office Depot and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole; _provided_ that any proposal or offer to the extent related to any
purchase of assets required to be divested or held separate (including by
trust or otherwise) pursuant to Section 5.3(d) shall not be deemed an
Office Depot Acquisition Proposal.

" _Office Depot Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Office Depot
Acquisition Proposal (except that references in the definition of the "Office
Depot Acquisition Proposal" to 15% shall be replaced by 50%) made after the
date of this Agreement by any Person other than OfficeMax or its
subsidiaries on terms that the Office Depot Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and
considering such factors as the Office Depot Board considers to be appropriate
(including the timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposal), are
more favorable to Office Depot and the Office Depot Stockholders than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account any change to
the transaction proposed by OfficeMax. 

6.11 _OfficeMax Acquisition Proposals._

(a) Subject to Section 6.11(c) through Section 6.11(f), OfficeMax agrees that,
from the date of this Agreement until the Closing or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, neither it nor
any of its subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate or solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries with
respect to, or the making of, an OfficeMax Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage
in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or
data to any Person relating to, an OfficeMax Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
OfficeMax Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter
of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
option agreement or other similar agreement relating to any OfficeMax
Acquisition Proposal (each an "O _fficeMax Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (v)
propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing relating to any
OfficeMax Acquisition Proposal.

 



68 (b) Subject to Section 6.11(c) through Section 6.11(f), prior to the
Closing, neither the OfficeMax Board nor any committee thereof shall,
directly or indirectly, (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or publicly propose
to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Office Depot, the
OfficeMax Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any OfficeMax Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) in the event of the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer for
any outstanding shares of OfficeMaxs capital stock, fail to recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the OfficeMax
Stockholders within ten business days of the commencement thereof (for the
avoidance of doubt, the taking of no position or a neutral position by the
OfficeMax Board in respect of the acceptance of any tender offer or exchange
offer by the OfficeMax Stockholders as of the end of the ten business day
period shall constitute a failure to recommend against any such offer), or
(iv) recommend that the OfficeMax Stockholders not adopt this Agreement or
approve the First Merger or the Second Merger (any action described in clauses
(i)-(iv) above being referred to as an "O _fficeMax Change of Recommendation_
").

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent OfficeMax or the
OfficeMax Board from complying with its disclosure obligations under Rule
14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such disclosure has the effect of an OfficeMax Change of
Recommendation, Office Depot shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
to the extent set forth in Section 8.1(d).

(d) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 6.11(a) and Section
6.11(b), until the earlier of receipt of the OfficeMax Stockholder Approval
and any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, if after the
date of this Agreement OfficeMax receives a written unsolicited bona fide
OfficeMax Acquisition Proposal that the OfficeMax Board has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors (i) constitutes an OfficeMax Superior Proposal or (ii) could
reasonably be expected to result in an OfficeMax Superior Proposal, then
OfficeMax may take the following actions: (A) furnish nonpublic information to
the third party making such OfficeMax Acquisition Proposal, if, and only
if, prior to furnishing such information, OfficeMax receives from the third
party an executed confidentiality agreement with provisions no less
restrictive to such third party with respect to the use or disclosure of
nonpublic information than the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) engage in
discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to such
OfficeMax Acquisition Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent OfficeMax or the OfficeMax Board
from, at any time prior to, but not after, the time of the receipt of the
OfficeMax Stockholder Approval, in response to the receipt of a written
unsolicited bona fide OfficeMax Acquisition Proposal after the date of this
Agreement that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.11, (i)
terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) in order to enter into a
definitive written agreement with respect to such OfficeMax Acquisition
Proposal or (ii) effecting an OfficeMax Change of Recommendation, if, prior
to taking any of the actions described in clauses (i) or (ii), (A) the
OfficeMax Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and

 



69  financial advisors, that (x) failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the OfficeMax directors fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law and (y) such OfficeMax Acquisition Proposal (in the
form, other than immaterial changes, that was the subject of the Superior
Proposal Notice) constitutes an OfficeMax Superior Proposal, (B) Office Depot
shall have received a Superior Proposal Notice of OfficeMaxs intention to
take such action at least four business days prior to the taking of such
action by OfficeMax and (C) the OfficeMax Board continues to believe, after
taking into account any modifications to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that are offered by Office Depot after its
receipt of the Superior Proposal Notice, that such OfficeMax Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute an OfficeMax Superior Proposal.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the OfficeMax Board from, at any
time prior to, but not after, the time of the receipt of the OfficeMax
Stockholder Approval, effecting an OfficeMax Change of Recommendation (other
than in response to the receipt of a written unsolicited bona fide OfficeMax
Acquisition Proposal, which shall be subject to Section 6.11(e)) if, prior to
taking such action, the OfficeMax Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the OfficeMax directors fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law; _provided, however_ that (i) Office Depot shall have received
a Board Recommendation Notice of the OfficeMax Boards intention to take any
such action at least four business days prior to the taking of such action by
the OfficeMax Board and (ii) the OfficeMax Board continues to believe, after
taking into account any modifications to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that are offered by Office Depot after its
receipt of such Board Recommendation Notice that failing to take such action
would be inconsistent with the OfficeMax directors fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law.

 

(g) OfficeMax agrees that it and its subsidiaries will (i) immediately cease

negotiations with any Person (other than the parties) conducted prior to the

(ii) request each third party that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement that relates to an OfficeMax Acquisition Proposal (other than Office
Depot) to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished
to such third party by OfficeMax or on its behalf. OfficeMax agrees that
it and its subsidiaries will take the necessary steps to promptly inform its
and its subsidiaries Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
Section 6.11.

(h) From and after the date of this Agreement, OfficeMax shall promptly orally
notify Office Depot of any request for information or any inquiries, proposals
or offers relating to an OfficeMax Acquisition Proposal indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person making such request,
inquiry, proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers and OfficeMax shall provide to Office Depot written
notice of any such inquiry, proposal or offer within 48 hours of such event
and copies of any written or electronic correspondence to or from any Person
making an OfficeMax Acquisition Proposal. OfficeMax shall keep Office Depot
informed orally, as soon as is reasonably practicable, of the status of any
OfficeMax Acquisition Proposal, including with respect to the status and terms
of any such proposal or offer and whether any such proposal or offer has been
withdrawn or rejected and OfficeMax shall provide to Office Depot written
notice of any such withdrawal or rejection and copies of any written proposals
or requests for information within 48 hours.

 



70  OfficeMax also agrees to provide any information to Office Depot (not
previously provided to Office Depot) that it is providing to another Person
pursuant to this Section 6.11 at substantially the same time it provides such

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or Section, such
reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated to the contrary. The descriptive Article and Section headings and
the table of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and are not intended to be part of and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. All terms defined in this
Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant to this Agreement unless otherwise
defined in such certificate or other document. The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders
of such term. Where a word or phrase is defined in this Agreement, each of its
other grammatical forms shall have a corresponding meaning. Any statute
defined or referred to in this Agreement or in any agreement or instrument

the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "herewith" and

80  otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. The phrases "the date of this
Agreement," "the date hereof" and words of similar import, shall be deemed to
refer to the date set forth on the cover page of this Agreement. Whenever the
last day for the exercise of any right or the discharge of any duty under this
Agreement falls on other than a business day, the party having such right or
duty shall have until the next business day to exercise such right or
discharge such duty. Unless otherwise indicated, the word "day" shall be
interpreted as a calendar day. No summary of this Agreement prepared by or on
behalf of any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. References to "dollars" or "$" are to United States dollars.

agreement among the parties and supersede all prior agreements and

force and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

 

9.6 ___Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be

Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms
or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision
of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as would be enforceable.

arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising under this Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
under this Agreement brought by another party or its successors or assigns,
shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery,
or in the event (but only in the event) that such court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction over such Action, in the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware. Each of the parties irrevocably submits with regard
to any Action for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts
and agrees that it will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than
the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with respect to this Agreement, (i)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above
named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance
with this Section 9.9, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such 

 



83  courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any
claim that (A) the Action in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum,
(B) the venue of such Action is improper or (B) this Agreement, or the subject
matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of
the parties also agrees that any final, non-appealable judgment against a
party in connection with any Action shall be conclusive and binding on such
party and that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court
of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A
certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment.

 

(b) Each of the parties consents to service being made through the notice
procedures set forth in Section 9.2 and agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail (return receipt requested and
first-class postage prepaid) to the respective addresses set forth in Section
9.2 shall be effective service of process for any suit or proceeding
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 9.9 shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

 

9.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties recognize and agree that if for any
reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached or violated,
immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money
damages would not be an adequate remedy under Applicable Law. Accordingly,
each party agrees that, in addition to all other remedies to which it may be
entitled, each of the parties is entitled to a decree of specific performance,
and each of the parties shall further be entitled to an injunction restraining
any violation or threatened violation of any of the provisions of this
Agreement without the necessity of posting a bond or other form of security.
In the event that any Action should be brought in equity to enforce any of the
provisions of this Agreement, no party will allege, and each party hereby
waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy under Applicable Law.

9.11  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations arising under this Agreement shall be directly or indirectly
assigned, delegated sublicensed or transferred by any of the parties (whether
by operation of law or otherwise), in whole or in part, to any other Person
(including any bankruptcy trustee) without the prior written consent of the
other parties; _provided_ that until the second business day preceding the
Closing, Office Depot may cause Merger Sub Two or Merger Sub Three to assign
all of such Persons rights, interests and obligations arising under this
Agreement to another newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of Office Depot
with substantially identical ownership, capitalization and organizational
documents, which subsidiary shall be substituted for Merger Sub Two or Merger
Sub Three, as the case may be, for all purposes hereunder, and OfficeMax may
cause Mapleby Holdco or Merger Sub One to assign all of such Persons rights,
interests and obligations arising under this Agreement to another newly
formed, wholly owned subsidiary of OfficeMax with substantially identical
ownership, capitalization and organizational documents, which subsidiary shall
be substituted for Mapleby Holdco or Merger Sub One, as the case may be, for
all purposes hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 



84 9.12 _Expenses_. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.2, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and thereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, except that those expenses incurred in connection
with filing, printing and mailing the Registration Statement and the Joint
Proxy Statement (including filing fees related thereto) will be shared equally
