At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or the holder of any shares of
capital stock or other securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub,
par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock, Parent-Owned Stock and Rollover Shares_.
All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" **Company Common
Stock** "), of the Company that are owned by the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company or owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time and all Rollover Shares shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.1(e), each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares and any shares to be canceled
in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be converted into the right to
receive, in cash and without interest, an amount equal to $13.25 per share
(the " **Merger Consideration** ") upon surrender of such share of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2 and in compliance therewith. At the
Effective Time, such shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate, or evidence of shares held in book-entry form, that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares (a " **Certificate**
") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Rollover Shares_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Rollover
Holders shall contribute the Rollover Shares to Holdings pursuant to the
Exchange Agreements. Subsequent to the receipt of the Rollover Shares from the
Rollover Holders, such Rollover Shares shall be contributed to Parent and will
automatically be canceled, by virtue of the Merger, in accordance with Section
2.1(b) above.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Adjustment Events_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed
into, or exchanged for, a different number or class of shares by reason of any
stock dividend, split, combination, subdivision or reclassification of shares,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger
Consideration payable per share of Company Common Stock shall be adjusted to
fairly reflect the effects of such transaction.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the
Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (other than Certificates
representing Rollover Shares, Dissenting Shares and any shares to be canceled
in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) (the " **Paying Agent** "). At the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, deposit with the
Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) upon surrender
of such Certificates, it being understood that any and all interest or other
amounts earned with respect to such funds shall be for the account of and
turned over to Parent in accordance with Section 2.2(g).

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Any references herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to (x)
exclude Certificates representing Rollover Shares, Dissenting Shares and any
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and (y) include
references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock, provided that the holders of any book-entry
shares shall not be required to surrender any Certificates in connection with
the procedures set forth in this Article II. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed (or, if such shares of Company Common Stock are
held in uncertificated, book-entry form, receipt of an "agents message" by
the Paying Agent), and such other documents as may reasonably be required by
the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the amount of Merger Consideration that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer
books of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor
may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if, upon presentation to the Paying Agent, such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any Taxes required
by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or
shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the

 



       
 

 



 

shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At
the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 



 

(d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any Certificate
that is delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not
have been surrendered prior to the date which is 12 months after the Effective
Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as
the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or
destroyed Certificate.

 



 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration, the Option Consideration and the Restricted Share Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " **Code** "), or any other
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the date which is 12 months
after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest or other amounts earned with respect thereto) that had been made
available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of
Certificates, and thereafter, subject to the time limitations in Section
2.2(d), such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by
such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest
thereon.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_.

 



 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that are held by a stockholder who is entitled to demand, and who
properly demands, appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in
all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (a " **Dissenting Stockholder** ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. For
purposes of this Agreement, " **Dissenting Shares** " means any shares of
Company Common Stock as to which a Dissenting Stockholder thereof has properly
exercised appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. No Dissenting
Stockholder shall be entitled to any Merger Consideration in respect of any
Dissenting Shares unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to seek appraisal
of its Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, and any Dissenting Stockholder shall
be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to the Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder and
not any Merger Consideration. If any Person who otherwise would be deemed a
Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed properly to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to seek appraisal with respect to any
Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as though
such Dissenting Shares had been converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement if conditions to payment are met. The Company shall
give Parent (a) prompt (and in any event with three (3) Business Days) notice
of any demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law and received by the
Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (b) the opportunity
to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for
appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do or
commit to do any of the foregoing.

or September 30, 2010 (excluding the exhibits, annexes and schedules thereto
and any forward-looking disclosures contained in "Forward Looking Statements"
and "Risk Factors" sections thereof included pursuant to the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) and only to the extent reasonably
apparent from the disclosure therein or (2) in the applicable section or
subsection of the disclosure schedule to this Agreement delivered by the
Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " **Company
Disclosure Schedule** ") (it being agreed that any information set forth in
one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to apply to
other sections of this Agreement and the Company Disclosure Schedule to the
extent such disclosure is made in a way so as to make its relevance to such
other section reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware, each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or limited

case may be, and each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all requisite
power and authority and possesses all governmental licenses, franchises,
permits, authorizations and approvals necessary

 



      
 

 



 

to enable it to use its corporate or other name and to own, lease or otherwise
hold and operate its properties and other assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing, have
such power or authority or possess such governmental licenses, permits,
authorizations or approvals, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing (in jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing)
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or to be
in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
made available in the Data Room to Parent, prior to the execution of this
Agreement, complete and accurate copies of the Company Certificate and the
bylaws of the Company (the " **Company Bylaws** "), and the comparable
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended

nature whatsoever (other than liens, charges and encumbrances for current
Taxes not yet due and payable) (collectively, " **Liens** "), and free of any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock or other equity interests. All issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and not
subject to preemptive or similar rights. No Subsidiary of the Company has or
is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments, Contracts, preemptive rights, rights of first refusal, demands,
conversion rights or other agreements, arrangements or obligations of any
character calling for it to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, or to
issue, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of capital stock, any
other equity security or Voting Debt of such Subsidiary, or securities or
rights convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable therefor. Except for
the capital stock of, or voting securities or equity interests in, its
Subsidiaries or as set forth in Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure

Section 4.2 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its controlled
Affiliates to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its or its controlled
Affiliates directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants or other advisors or representatives (collectively, "
**Representatives** ") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
propose or encourage, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, any
Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or offers or the making of any proposal or
any other efforts or attempt that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
communications or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Representatives) any information with
respect to, or otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with any Person (other
than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Representatives) with respect to, any
Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or offers or the making of any proposal or
any other efforts or attempt that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal, (iii) grant a waiver under Section 203 of the DGCL or any
other Takeover Law or enter into any Contract with respect to or that may
reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal, or otherwise endorse,
any Takeover Proposal, or (iv) resolve to do any of the foregoing. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to,
immediately cease and terminate all existing activities, communications and
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover
Proposal (including, but not limited to, access to any electronic or other
data room), shall request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished in connection therewith. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time prior to the time
that the Required Stockholder Vote has been obtained, the Company, in response
to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal received after the
date hereof that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) (x) constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (y) that failure to so respond to
such Takeover Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, and which Takeover Proposal
was not solicited after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 4.2, may, and may permit and authorize its Affiliates
and its and its Affiliates Representatives to, in each case subject to
compliance with Section 4.2(c) and the other provisions of this Agreement, (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal,
in each case pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with standstill
provisions identical in all substantive respects to, and which otherwise
contains terms that are no less favorable to the Company than, those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company shall
concurrently provide or make available to Parent any information concerning
the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such third party which was not
previously provided to Parent. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 4.2(a) by any controlled Affiliate of the Company or any of
the Companys or its controlled Affiliates Representatives shall be deemed to
be a breach by the Company of this Section 4.2(a).

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " **Takeover Proposal** " means any
proposal, inquiry or offer (whether or not in writing and including any tender
offer or exchange offer) from any Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates) with respect to, in a single transaction or series of
transactions, any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business
combination, dissolution, liquidation, recapitalization, reorganization, or
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the
business of which constitutes 15% or more

 



       
 

 



 

of the consolidated net income, revenues or assets (whether determined by
reference to book value or fair market value) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) sale, lease, contribution, transfer or
other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint
venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in a Subsidiary of
the Company or otherwise), of any business or asset of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries representing 15% or more of the consolidated net income,
revenues or assets (whether determined by reference to book value or fair
market value) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii)
issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or
the stockholders of any Person) or group of securities (or options, rights or
warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such
securities) or any interest in such securities representing 15% or more of any
class of capital stock of the Company or of the voting power of the Companys
capital stock, (iv) transaction in which any Person (or the stockholders of
any Person) shall acquire, directly or indirectly, Beneficial Ownership, or
the right to acquire Beneficial Ownership, or formation of any group which
beneficially owns or has the right to acquire Beneficial Ownership of, 15% or
more of any class of capital stock of the Company or of the voting power of
the Companys capital stock or (v) combination of the foregoing.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " **Superior Proposal** " means any
binding _bona fide_ written offer (on its most recently amended or modified
terms), which was not solicited after the date hereof and did not result from
a breach of Section 4.2(a), made by any Person (other than Parent or Merger
Sub or any of their Affiliates) that, if consummated, would result in such
Person (or in the case of a direct merger between such Person and the Company,
the stockholders of such Person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than
50% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or of the voting power
of the Companys capital stock or all or substantially all the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer the Board of
Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) (i) provides a higher value from a financial
point of view to all of the stockholders of the Company (in their capacities
as stockholders) than the consideration payable in the Merger (taking into
account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement
(including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise) and the time likely to be
required to consummate such Superior Proposal) and (ii) is reasonably likely
to be completed in a timely fashion, taking into account the conditionality
and likelihood of consummation and all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal and the Person making the proposal.

 



 

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withhold, withdraw (or not continue to make), change, qualify or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or propose publicly to
withhold, withdraw (or not continue to make), change, qualify or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation or any
approval or recommendation by any such committee regarding this Agreement and
the Merger, or approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to
approve, recommend or declare advisable any Takeover Proposal, or resolve or
agree to take any such action, (ii) fail to publicly recommend against any
Takeover Proposal or fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation or
any approval or recommendation by any such committee regarding this Agreement
or the Merger within two Business Days after Parent so requests, (iii) fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iv) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or permit the Company or
any of its Affiliates to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

partnership agreement or other Contract (each, an " **Acquisition Agreement**
") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely
to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in
accordance with Section 4.2(a)), or (v) take (or fail to take) any other
action or make any other public statement that is inconsistent with the
Company Recommendation (any such action (or failure to act) or resolution or
agreement to take such action in clauses (i) \- (v) above being referred to
herein as an " **Adverse Recommendation Change** "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing and anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to
the time that the Required Stockholder Vote has been obtained, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal, and after
determining in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (x) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement,
_provided_ , concurrently with any such termination, the Company pays to
Parent the fee required by Section 5.6(b)(ii)(B) and any purported termination
pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect
unless in advance of or concurrently with such termination, the Company pays
to Parent the fee required by Section 5.6(b)(ii)(B); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (1) the Board of Directors of the Company may not effect such an Adverse
Recommendation Change and (2) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 4.2(b) may be made, in each case unless the Notice Period has
ended and the Company has complied with all its obligations pursuant to this
Section 4.2. No Adverse Recommendation Change or termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.2(b) may be made unless (A) the Board of
Directors shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is
prepared to (I) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change (an " **Adverse
Recommendation Change Notice** ") or (II) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 4.2(b) in response to a Superior Proposal (a " **Superior
Proposal Notice** "), which notice shall contain a description of the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the
bidder and a copy of the definitive Acquisition Agreement for such Superior
Proposal in the form to be entered into), together with any information
required to be delivered to Parent concurrently therewith pursuant to Section
4.2(a) and (B) Parent does not make, within three Business Days after the
receipt of such notice (the " **Notice Period** "), a proposal that would, in
the reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor),
cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal. The Company agrees to negotiate in good faith
with Parent during any Notice Period to allow Parent to match or better any
Superior Proposal (as amended). Any changes to the financial terms or any
change to other material terms of such Superior Proposal occurring prior to
the Companys effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.2(b) shall require the Company to provide
to Parent a new Adverse Recommendation Change Notice or Superior Proposal
Notice and a new Notice Period and to comply with the requirements of this
Section 4.2(b) with respect to each such new written notice. In determining
whether to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or whether to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.2(b), the Board of Directors of the
Company shall discuss with Parent and take into account any such changes to
Parents proposal and any other information provided by Parent in response to
an Adverse Recommendation Change Notice or Superior Proposal Notice that
would, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor), cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal. The Company shall not submit any
Takeover Proposal or any Superior Proposal to a vote of the stockholders of
the Company prior to the termination of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 4.2, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event
within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in writing
of (i) any Takeover Proposal or any request for information or inquiry that
expressly contemplates or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover
Proposal, (ii) the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal,
request or inquiry (including the identity of the bidder and any change to the
financial terms, conditions or other material terms thereof) and (iii) the
determination by the Board that a Takeover Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal. The Company shall (A) keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status (including any change to the
financial terms, conditions, or other material terms) of any such Takeover
Proposal, request or inquiry on a reasonably current basis (and in any event
at Parents request and otherwise no later than 24 hours after the occurrence
of any material change, development, discussions or negotiations) and (B)
provide to Parent, as soon as practicable and in any event within 24 hours
after receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all draft agreements (and any
other written material to the extent such material contains any financial
terms, conditions or other material terms relating to any Takeover Proposal),
written inquiries or correspondence sent by or provided to the Company (or its
Representatives) in connection with any such Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract
with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any Contract, in each case
that prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders, in each case
if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after
consultation with outside legal counsel), such action is required by
applicable Law or necessary for the Board of Directors to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the taking of any such position or making of any
such disclosure shall be subject to and only taken in compliance with Section
4.2(b) and that the Company shall, to the extent practicable, provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to comment on and review any such disclosure
and, _provided_ _further_ , that any disclosure other than (A) a factually
accurate statement by the Company that only describes the Companys receipt of
a Takeover Proposal, the identity of the Person or group making such proposal,
the terms and conditions thereof and the operation of this Agreement with
respect thereto, and that also contains a reaffirmation by the Board of its
unanimous approval and recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and its unanimous recommendations that the stockholders of
the Company approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger in such disclosure
and a "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (B) an express rejection of any applicable
Takeover Proposal or (C) an express reaffirmation of the Company
Recommendation, shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V _ 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

Section 5.1 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof and in any event
within eight (8) Business Days after the date hereof, the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary Proxy Statement. Each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish all information

 



      
 

 



 

concerning such Person to the other as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC or any other government
official for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or any other government
official, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement
to be cleared by the SEC as promptly as possible. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of
such document or response) and (ii) shall include in such document or response
all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. If, at any time prior to the
Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by
the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 



 

(b) For the purpose of obtaining the Required Stockholder Approval, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts and take all action reasonably
necessary in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Certificate and
Company Bylaws, to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of and
convene a meeting of its stockholders (the " **Stockholders Meeting** ") as
soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further
comments to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such record date, but in no event later than 3 Business Days
after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. The notice of such
Stockholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to adopt this Agreement
will be considered at the Stockholders Meeting. Subject to Section 4.2, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to stockholders of the
Company that they approve this Agreement, and shall include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement and shall take all action reasonably necessary in accordance
with the DGCL and the Company Certificate and Company Bylaws, and in any event
within 40 days to duly convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the
stockholders of the Company.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality; Financing_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to
Parent and to Parents Representatives access upon reasonable advance notice
and during normal business hours to all their respective properties, assets,
books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents, information, payors, providers,
Physician Partners, directors, officers and employees, but only to the extent
that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish to Parent any information
concerning its business as Parent may

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to) afford such access or
furnish such information to the extent that doing so is restricted under
applicable Law or otherwise would result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to allow
for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege). Following the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time, Parent may (but shall not be required to), following
reasonable notice to the Company, contact and interview any Company Personnel
and review the personnel records and such other information concerning the
Company Personnel as Parent may reasonably request, provided such review is
permitted by applicable Law. No information or knowledge obtained by Parent or
any of its Representatives in any investigation pursuant to this Section
5.2(a) shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company in this Agreement. Except as required by
any applicable Law or Judgment, Parent will hold, and will direct its
Representatives to hold, any and all information received from the Company
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(b) Parent acknowledges that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to fully
satisfy, on a timely basis, all terms, conditions, representations and
warranties set forth in the Commitment Letters and to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letters (or on other terms not imposing any new or
additional conditions and otherwise not reasonably likely to cause any
material delay in the consummation of the Financing), including, using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment
Letters, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent
set forth therein that are within its control, and (iii) consummate the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters at the Closing, including
using its reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders and the other Persons
providing such Financing to fund the Financing required to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the
Closing Date. Upon the Companys request, Parent shall inform the Company with
respect to all material activity concerning the status of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters and shall give the Company prompt
notice of any material adverse change with respect to such Financing. Parent
agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within two Business
Days, if at any time prior to the Closing Date (A) any of the Commitment
Letters shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (B) any financing source
that is a party to any Commitment Letter notifies Parent in writing that such
source no longer intends to provide Financing to Parent on the terms set forth
therein, or (C) for any reason Parent no longer believes in good faith that it
will be able to obtain a portion or all of the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters on substantially the terms described therein. Parent shall
not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, without the prior written consent
of the Company, intentionally take any action or enter into any transaction,
including any merger, acquisition, joint venture, disposition, lease, contract
or debt or equity financing, the purpose of which is to impair, delay or
prevent Parents obtaining of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letters. Parent shall not amend, or agree to amend, the Commitment Letters in
any manner that would materially delay or prevent the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the Commitment
Letters shall be terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to
Parent for any reason, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain,
and, if obtained, will provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing
commitment that provides for at least the same amount of financing as such
Commitment Letters as originally issued and on terms not materially less
favorable then the Commitment Letters to Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall (and the Company shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to) provide, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing, including (i) assisting with
the preparation of materials for bank information memoranda and similar
documents required in connection with the Financing and causing the Companys
advisors to provide comfort letters, opinions and consents requested by
prospective financing sources, (ii) executing and delivering customary
guarantee, pledge and security documents and related officer certificates or
other documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent and otherwise
reasonably facilitating the guaranteeing of obligations and the pledging of
collateral; provided that, the foregoing notwithstanding, no obligations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives under any
such agreement, certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until
the Closing and the foregoing documents shall be held in escrow pending
Closing, (iii) furnishing Parent and its financing sources with financial and
other pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may
be reasonably requested by Parent or its financing sources, including
information related to the Company and its Subsidiaries required by regulatory
authorities including under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act, (iv) permitting
the prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate and appraise the
Companys and its Subsidiaries current assets and liabilities, cash
management and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto
for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements, and (v) participating
in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and drafting
sessions. The provisions of this Section 5.2(c) shall not require such
cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment fee or similar
fee or incur any liability with respect to the Financing prior to the Closing
and Parent or Merger Sub shall bear all costs and reimburse the officers and
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any out-of-pocket expenses
they may incur in complying with this Section 5.2(c), including expenses
associated with attending meetings, presentations, road shows and due
diligence presentations. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notice_.

 



 

(a) Each party from whom a filing under the HSR Act would be required in order
for the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated lawfully shall, as
promptly as practicable (but in no event later than five Business Days)
following the date hereof, file with the Federal Trade Commission (the "
**FTC** ") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice (the " **DOJ** ") all materials initially required to be filed under
the HSR Act in connection with this transaction. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the parties hereto shall request expedited treatment of any
such filings and shall work together and shall furnish to one another such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may require in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission under the HSR Act
or other Competition Law. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
parties hereto shall keep one another apprised of the status of, and give each
other advance notice of, and a meaningful opportunity to review, all
communications with, and all inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity, and shall
comply promptly with any such reasonable inquiry or request. To the extent
advisable and permitted by the relevant Governmental Entity, the parties
hereto shall permit one another to attend all meetings or conferences between
one or more of the parties hereto and one or more Governmental Entity under
the HSR Act or other Competition Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
taking, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in
Article VI, (ii) the taking of all reasonable steps to provide any
supplemental information requested by a Governmental Entity, including
participating in meetings with officials of such entity in the course of its
review of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate and make effective the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In connection with and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto
agrees to use its best efforts to obtain, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in obtaining, all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents, approvals, clearances, orders and authorizations from, and to give
any necessary notices to, Governmental Entities and other Persons (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
actions, registrations, declarations and filings set forth on Section 5.3(b)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule); provided, however, that neither the
Company nor any of the Subsidiaries of the Company shall make any payment or
commitment to a third party or modify the terms of any Contract in connection
with obtaining such actions, waivers, consents, approvals, clearances, orders
or authorizations without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld). In connection with and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each of the Company and its Board of Directors shall use its
reasonable best efforts (A) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) if any Takeover
Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to take all action
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if any objections
are asserted with respect to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
hereby under any Competition Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental
Entity or any private party, challenging the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of any Competition Law, or which would
otherwise prohibit or materially impair or materially delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such
objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as reasonably practicable. In
this context, "commercially reasonable efforts" shall include, without
limitation, (i) defending any lawsuits or other legal Proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, that challenge this Agreement or the consummation
of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby; (ii) seeking to
have lifted, vacated, or reversed any stay, injunction, temporary restraining
order, or other restraint entered by any court or other Governmental Entity;
and (iii) agreeing to do or permitting to be done any of the foregoing;
provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
the Company shall not (unless directed to do so by Parent), and Parent shall
not be obligated to, (A) propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition
of any assets or businesses of

 



      
 

 



 

Parent (including its Subsidiaries and Affiliates) or the Company, including
entering into customary ancillary agreements relating to any such sale,
divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses; or (B) otherwise take
or commit to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit the freedom
of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations) or
affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one
or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations)
businesses, product lines or assets.

 



 

(d) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly notify
Parent of (A) any written notice or other written communication from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is required in connection with
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(B) its discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, (1) would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in paragraph (a) or (c) of
Section 6.2 and (2) is incapable of being cured by the Company by the
Termination Date (including any extension thereof pursuant to Section
7.1(b)(i)); and (C) any suits, actions or proceedings commenced or threatened
that relate to the consummation of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement of which the Company has
Knowledge; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, each of the parties shall give
prompt notice to the other parties of (i) any representation or warranty made
by such party contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or (ii) the failure
of such party to perform any material obligation, covenant or agreement to be
performed by such party under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, obligations,
covenants or agreements of any of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of any of the parties under this
Agreement.

 



 

(f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties to this
Agreement shall cooperate and consult with one another, to the fullest extent
possible, subject to entering into a customary joint defense agreement, in
connection with any stockholder Proceeding against any of them or any of their
respective directors or officers with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In furtherance of and without in any way limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of
any such Proceedings, and the Company shall (i) cooperate fully with Parent in
connection with, and consult with and permit Parent and its Representatives to
participate in, the defense, negotiations and settlement of such Proceedings,
(ii) give consideration to Parents advice with respect to such Proceedings
and (iii) obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to settling or
satisfying any such claim, it being understood and agreed that the Company
shall control such defense and that this Section 5.3(f) shall not give Parent
the right to direct such defense except to the extent that Parent or Merger
Sub is named as a defendant in such litigation and in that case solely as to
the defense of Parent and Merger Sub.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
agrees that the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the Company Stock Plans and the Purchase Plan) shall
adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any
consents, releases, waivers or amendments, as required by the terms of any
Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Share or the Purchase Plan, or as

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably requested by Parent) as may be required to (x) cause the Company
Stock Plans and each Company Restricted Share and Company Stock Option to be
terminated as of the Effective Time and cause any provision in any other
agreement, arrangement or benefit plan providing for the issuance, transfer,
purchase or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any interest in
respect of any capital stock of the Company to be deleted as of the Effective
Time, (y) ensure that no Person has any rights under any Company Stock Plan,
Company Restricted Share or Company Stock Option, or such other agreement,
arrangement or benefit plan to acquire any capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent and that the Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
not have any further obligation or liability under any of the foregoing
Company Stock Plans, Company Restricted Share and Company Stock Options or
other such agreements, arrangements or benefit plans, except as specifically
contemplated by this Section 5.4 and (z) give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 5.4, including the following:

 



 

(i) at the Effective Time, the Company shall enter into an option cancellation
agreement with each holder of a Company Stock Option (each, an " **Option
Cancellation Agreement** "), which Option Cancellation Agreement shall be in a
form reasonably acceptable to Parent and shall provide that each unexercised
Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled at the Effective
Time, with the holder of such Company Stock Option becoming entitled to
receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect
thereto, an amount in cash equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger
Consideration over (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested), which amount shall be payable
to such holder at or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (the
" **Option Consideration** ");

 



 

(ii) at the Effective Time, each unvested Company Restricted Share that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, with
the holder of such Company Restricted Share becoming entitled to receive, in
full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount
in cash equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the maximum number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Share
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested), which
amount shall be payable to such holder at or as soon as practicable following
the Effective Time (the " **Restricted Share Consideration** "); and

 



 

(iii) with respect to the Purchase Plan, (A) participation shall be limited to
those employees who are participants on the date of this Agreement; (B) no
Option Period (as defined in the Purchase Plan) shall be commenced after the
date of this Agreement; (C) if, with respect to an Option Period in effect on
the date of this Agreement, the Effective Time occurs prior to the Exercise
Date (as defined in the Purchase Plan) for such Option Period, upon the
Effective Time, each purchase right under the Purchase Plan outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be exercised to purchase from
the Company whole shares of Company Common Stock (subject to the provisions of
the Purchase Plan regarding the maximum number and value of shares purchasable
per participant) at the applicable price determined under the terms of the
Purchase Plan for the then outstanding Option Period using such date on which
the Effective Time occurs as the final Exercise Date for such Option Period,
and any remaining accumulated but unused payroll deductions shall be
distributed to the relevant participants without interest as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time; and

 



      
 

 



 

(D) the Purchase Plan shall terminate, effective upon the earlier of the
Purchase Date for the Option Period in effect on the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) With respect to the Company Stock Options, upon surrender to the Surviving
Corporation of the original Company Stock Option agreement and an executed
copy of an Option Cancellation Agreement (collectively, the " **Option
Documentation** "), the Surviving Corporation shall promptly deliver (but in
all cases not later than the fifth Business Day after the later of the Closing
Date and the date of receipt of the Option Documentation) to the registered
holder of such Company Stock Options (as indicated in the records of the
Company), the Option Consideration less any required withholding Taxes. At the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Option outstanding as of the Effective Time
shall be canceled and each holder of an agreement representing such canceled
Company Stock Option shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Stock Option and shall not be entitled to receive any payment with
respect thereto other than the Option Consideration. In the event that any
Company Stock Option agreement shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit (in form and substance satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation) of that fact by the person claiming such Company Stock
Option agreement to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the granting of an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to
the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against either of
them with respect to such Company Stock Option agreement, the Company will
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Option
agreement, the portion of the Option Consideration with respect to such
Company Stock Option, to which such Person is entitled pursuant hereto.
Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a)(i), with respect to any unexercised Company
Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock in excess of the Merger Consideration, the parties acknowledge and agree
that the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain an Option Cancellation
Agreement with respect to such Company Stock Option.

 



 

(c) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be paid without
interest. Any Person making a payment pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from that payment such amounts as the payor is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over by any Person pursuant to this Section 5.4 to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person entitled to payment under
this Section 5.4 in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by a Person pursuant to this Section 5.4.

 



 

(d) Simultaneous with the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall pay the Company
an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of Option Consideration and
Restricted Share Consideration to be paid to holders of Company Stock Options
and Company Restricted Shares, respectively, in accordance with the provisions
of Section 5.4, and the Company shall cause such consideration to be paid to
such holders pursuant to Section 5.4.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably
required to cause the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.4 by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16
of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 5.5 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other
agreements of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement (in each
case, to the extent copies of which have been made available in the Data Room
to Parent prior to the date hereof) shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time, and
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms without amendment, repeal or other modification
for a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date; provided that such
obligations shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under
applicable Law. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be jointly and severally liable to pay and perform in a
timely manner such indemnification obligations.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then,
and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.5.

 



 

(c) From the Closing through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time (such
period, the " **Tail Period** "), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain in effect the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than those of such
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement (copies of which have been made
available in the Date Room to Parent); _provided_ _further_ that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation may (i) substitute therefor policies of any reputable
insurance company or (ii) satisfy its obligation under this Section 5.5(c) by
causing the Company to obtain, on or prior to the Closing Date, prepaid (or
"tail") directors and officers liability insurance policy at Parents
expense, in each case, the material terms of which, including coverage and
amount, are no less favorable in the aggregate to such directors and officers
than the insurance coverage otherwise required under this Section 5.5(c);
_provided_ _further_ that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance (which the
Company represents is $103,500); and _provided_ _further_ that if the annual
premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.5 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by Contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.6, all fees and expenses
incurred in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with this Agreement, the Merger, the Financing and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Merger is consummated, the Surviving
Corporation shall, within ten Business Days after Parents request for such
reimbursement, reimburse Parent for all Parent Expenses, if such expenses were
not reimbursed prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(c) or (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(f), then, in
each such case, the Company shall pay Parents designee a fee equal to
$4,368,000 (the " **Company Termination Fee** ") by wire transfer of same-day
funds to an account designated by Parent (A) in the case of a termination by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c), within two Business Days after such
termination and (B) in the case of a termination by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(f), the date of termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) In the event that (i) prior to the termination of this Agreement, any
Person makes or publicly proposes a Takeover Proposal (for purposes of this
Section 5.6(c), substituting 50% for the 15% thresholds set forth in the
definition of Takeover Proposal) or publicly announces an intent (whether or
not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal and (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or
7.1(b)(iv) or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d), and (iii) within 12 months
after termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into any acquisition
agreement or other definitive agreement or Contract providing for, or shall
have consummated or publicly approved or recommended to the stockholders of
the Company, any Takeover Proposal (whether or not the Takeover Proposal was
the same Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (i)), then the Company shall
pay to Parents designee the Company Termination Fee upon the earlier of the
date of entering into a definitive agreement for or consummating a Takeover
Proposal.

 



 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(g) or (ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) after the Company has
delivered a valid notice to Parent that the Company will terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g) if Parent and Merger Sub subsequently
breach their obligation to cause the Merger to be consummated within 10
Business Days after the date the Closing is required to take place pursuant to
Section 1.2 (provided that such notice is delivered to Parent prior to the
Termination Date (including any extension thereof pursuant to Section
7.1(b)(i))) (a " **Parent Designated Termination** "), in each case (A)
because Parent and Merger Sub fail to cause the Merger to be consummated
because of a failure to receive the proceeds of one or more of the Financing
(other than if solely due to a failure by Guarantor to fund its commitment
pursuant to the Equity Letter) that, together with the amount of equity
financing committed pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter, is sufficient to
fund the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
because of their refusal to accept a new financing commitment that provides
for at least the same amount of financing as the Commitment Letters and on
terms that are not materially less favorable to Parent then the Commitment
Letters, and (B) Parent and Merger Sub are not otherwise in material and
willful breach of this Agreement (including their respective obligations
pursuant to Section 5.2(b)) (a " **Non-Breach Financing Failure** "), then
Parent shall pay to the Company a fee equal to $6,552,000 (the " **Parent
Termination Fee** ") by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account
designated by the Company within two Business Days after such termination. If
this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(g) or by
Parent pursuant to a Parent Designated Termination, in each case in
circumstances not involving a Non-Breach Financing Failure, then Parent shall
pay to the Company an amount equal to $10,920,000 (the " **Parent**

 



      
 

 



 

 **Default Fee** ") by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account
designated by the Company within two Business Days after such termination.

 



 

(e) The Company hereby acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 5.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the
amounts due pursuant to Sections 5.6(b) or (c) and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the amounts set forth in Section 5.6(b) or (c) or any portion of
such amount, then the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts
set forth in Section 5.6(b) or (c) at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event the Company
Termination Fee becomes payable, then the Company Termination Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its Affiliates and their stockholders
under this Agreement except as otherwise provided in Section 8.11. If Parent
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) in the case of a willful
breach by the Company, then Parent may seek Parent Damages against the
Company; _provided_ , that the maximum aggregate liability (inclusive of the
Company Termination Fee) of the Company shall not exceed the Company Liability
Cap. The damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where a Company Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and
incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant
to this Section 5.6 are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages
in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Parent hereby acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
5.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the Company would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails promptly to pay the amounts due
pursuant to Section 5.6(d) and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Parent or Merger Sub for
the amounts set forth in Section 5.6(d) or any portion of such amount, then
Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit and any appeal
relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in Section
5.6(d) at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in the event that the Parent Termination Fee or Parent Default Fee
becomes payable, then the Parent Termination Fee or Parent Default Fee, as
applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its
Affiliates and their stockholders under this Agreement. If the Company
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) in the case of a willful
breach by Parent or Merger Sub, then the Company may seek Company Damages
against Parent; _provided_ , that the maximum aggregate liability (inclusive
of the Parent Termination Fee) of Parent and Merger Sub, collectively, shall
not exceed the Parent Liability Cap. The damages resulting from termination of
this Agreement under circumstances where a Parent Termination Fee or Parent
Default Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and
therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 5.6 are not a penalty
but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Company for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the maximum aggregate
liability of Parent and its Affiliates and their stockholders (collectively,
the " **Parent Group** ") (including any amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 5.6) for any direct or indirect loss or damage suffered in connection
with, or arising out of or under, this Agreement, including, but not limited
to, the negotiation, entry into, performance, or the terms of this Agreement,
any agreement or document contemplated hereby, the failure of the Merger to be
consummated or for a breach or claimed breach or failure or claimed failure to
perform hereunder and including the benefit of the bargain lost by the
Companys stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including
any lost premium, other combination opportunities and the time value of money)
(such damages, collectively, the " **Company Damages** ") or otherwise shall
be limited to $10,920,000 plus any amounts that may be payable under the
second sentence of Section 5.6(f) (the " **Parent Liability Cap** "). In no
event shall the Company or its Affiliates or their stockholders seek or permit
to be sought on behalf of the Company any damages or any other recovery,
judgment or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or
punitive damages, from any member of the Parent Group other than seeking
amounts payable by the Guarantor pursuant to the Limited Guarantee but subject
to the Parent Liability Cap. The Company acknowledges and agrees that it has
no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, in
each case with respect to Company Damages, any member of the Parent Group
(other than Parent to the extent provided in this Agreement and the Guarantor
to the extent provided in the Limited Guarantee (but in each case subject to
the Parent Liability Cap), through Parent or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent against any
other member of the Parent Group, by the enforcement of any assessment or by
any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable Law, or otherwise. Recourse against Parent to the extent provided
in this Agreement and the Guarantor to the extent provided in the Limited
Guarantee (but in each case subject to the Parent Liability Cap) shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates and their
stockholders against any other member of the Parent Group in respect of any
liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
acknowledges that Merger Sub is a newly-formed company and does not have any
material assets except in connection with this Agreement as expressly set
forth herein. The terms of this Section 5.6(g) shall not be deemed to be
superseded, amended or modified in any respect by the terms of any other
provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 5.6(g) are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each member of
the Parent Group.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary but subject to Section
8.11, the maximum aggregate liability of the Company and its Affiliates and
their stockholders (including any amounts payable pursuant to this Section
5.6) for any direct or indirect loss or damage suffered in connection with, or
arising out of or under, this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the
negotiation, entry into, performance, or the terms of this Agreement, any
agreement or document contemplated hereby, the failure of the Merger to be
consummated or for a breach or claimed breach or failure or claimed failure to
perform hereunder (such damages, collectively, " **Parent Damages** ") or
otherwise shall be limited to $10,920,000 plus any amounts that may be payable
under the second sentence of Section 5.6(e) (the " **Company Liability Cap**
"). In no event shall any member of the Parent Group seek or permit to be
sought on behalf of any member of the Parent Group any damages or any other
recovery, judgment or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect,
or punitive damages, from the Company or any of its Affiliates or any of their
stockholders in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in excess of the Company Liability Cap;
provided that nothing shall limit the rights of Parent and Merger Sub under
Section 8.11. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges

 



      
 

 



 

and agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no personal liability
shall attach to, in each case with respect to Parent Damages, any Affiliate or
stockholder of the Company, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate veil, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law, or
otherwise. The terms of this Section 5.6(h) shall not be deemed to be
superseded, amended or modified in any respect by the terms of any other
provisions of this Agreement other than Section 8.11. The provisions of this
Section 5.6(h) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each Affiliate and stockholder of the Company.

 



 

(i) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion nor shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on
more than one occasion, whether the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement
at the same time or at different times and upon the occurrence of different
events.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_.

 



 

The parties agree that the initial press release(s) to be issued with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form(s)
heretofore agreed to by the parties. Except with respect to any Adverse
Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall, to the extent at all reasonably practicable, consult with each other
before making, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon, any other press release or other public statements with respect
to this Agreement, the Merger, the Financing and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such reasonably practicable
consultation (which consultation shall not be unreasonably delayed), except as
may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation Compliance_.

 



 

Parent shall cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to
perform all of its respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this
Agreement and, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not engage in any
activities of any nature except as provided in or contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Company Benefit Plan Matters_.

 



 

(a) During the period from the Closing Date until the 12-month anniversary
thereof, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to Persons
who are actively employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remain in the employment of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time (the "
**Continuing Employees** ") compensation (including base salary and incentive
and bonus opportunities) and benefits (including paid time off, 401(k), health
and severance) that are materially no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time or those generally in effect with respect to similarly situated employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) The service of each Continuing Employee with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any predecessor employer) prior to the Effective Time shall
be treated as service with Parent and its Subsidiaries for purposes of each
(A) "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3(2) of ERISA), (B) "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA), (C) post-retirement or employment health or medical
plan, program, policy or arrangement, (D) bonus, incentive or deferred
compensation plan, program, policy or arrangement, (E) severance, change in
control, retention or termination plan, program, policy or arrangement or (F)
other material compensation or benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement,
including fringe benefits, vacation pay, service awards and reimbursement of
moving expenses (each, a " **Parent Benefit Plan** "), in each case for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit levels (but not actual accruals
except with respect to vacation and paid time off accruals), but not in any
case where credit would result in duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) Following the Effective Time, for purposes of each Parent Benefit Plan in
which any Continuing Employee or his or her eligible dependents is eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any pre-
existing condition, exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period
to the extent such condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period was
satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement as of the Effective Time (or, if later, any applicable plan
transaction date) and (ii) provide full credit for any co-payments,
deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the Effective Time
for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or such transition date)
occurs.

 



 

(d) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to, honor, in accordance with its terms, each Company Benefit
Plan and Company Benefit Agreement and all obligations thereunder, including
any rights or benefits arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event), and
Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger constitutes a
change of control or change in control, as the case may be, for all purposes
under such Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries make, either before or after the Closing, the payments
to the individuals specified in Section 5.9(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule in the amounts specified therein unless (and to the extent that) the
conditions specified in Section 5.9(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
have been satisfied. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause the
agreements that entitle such individuals to receive such payments to be
amended to reflect the terms of the proviso in the immediately preceding
sentence. Simultaneously with the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall
deposit with the Companys payroll provider funds in an amount equal to the
severance payments to the individuals specified in Section 5.9(d)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule in the amounts specified therein and, to the
extent that all or a portion of any such payment is not permitted to be paid
promptly after the Closing pursuant to the terms of the applicable severance
arrangement through the Companys payroll provider, then simultaneously with
the Closing the Surviving Corporation shall deposit funds in an amount equal
to such unpaid portion into a grantor trust established for the benefit of
such individual consistent with the terms of Revenue Procedure 92-64, 22
I.R.B. 11 (8/17/92) on terms mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company.

 



 

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to employ any Continuing Employee for any length of time
following the Closing Date, subject to Parents and the Companys compliance
with any applicable severance or change of control arrangements. Nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, shall be construed to prevent Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries from (i) terminating, or modifying the terms of
employment of, any Continuing Employee following the Closing Date or (ii)
terminating or modifying to any extent any Company Benefit Plan, Company
Benefit Agreement, Parent Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may
establish or maintain; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that, and
for so long as, a Continuing Employee remains employed by Parent

 



      
 

 



 

or any of its Subsidiaries during the 12-month period following the Closing,
the compensation and benefits payable to such employee during such period
shall be subject to Section 5.9(a). No covenant or other undertaking in this
Agreement shall constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan, program,
policy or arrangement, and any covenant or undertaking that suggests that an
employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement will be amended shall be
effective only upon the adoption of a written amendment in accordance with the
amendment procedures of such plan, program, policy or arrangement. The
provisions of this Section 5.9 are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.9 is intended to, or shall,
constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee
benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no current or former
employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or have the right to
enforce the provisions hereof

 



 

Section 5.10 _Convertible Notes; Convertible Note Hedge Agreement and Warrant
Agreement_.

 



 

The Company shall promptly take such actions as are reasonably requested in
writing by Parent or as are otherwise required by the applicable instruments
in respect of the (a) the Convertible Notes, (b) the Warrant Confirmation
dated June 21, 2007, issued by the Company to Deutsche Bank AG London, LLC and
Deutsche Bank AG New York (the " **DB Warrant** "), and (c) the hedge
transaction (the " **DB Hedge Transaction** ") entered into with Deutsche Bank
AG London, LLC (" **DB London** ") and Deutsche Bank AG New York (" **DB New
York** ") on June 21, 2007 relating to the Convertible Notes and the DB
Warrant, in each case as directed by and in accordance with the terms and
conditions specified in writing by Parent, and the Company shall consult with
Parent before taking any action with respect to any of the foregoing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not be obligated under this Section 5.10 to take any action that (i) is not
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, (ii) except as
otherwise provided in the following sentence, could potentially expose the
Company to material liability or expense or (iii) could result in any
representation or warranty of the Company in this Agreement being or becoming
untrue or incorrect or that could result in the Company being in breach of any
of its obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior
to February 18, 2011, the Company shall enter into binding agreements, in form
and substance satisfactory to Parent, with DB London and DB New York to settle
the DB Hedge Transaction (which settlement shall result in a payment to the
Company), using the Cancellation and Payment (Calculation Agent Determination)
methodology, subject to the terms of the DB Hedge Transaction. All actions,
notices, announcements and other documentation related to the foregoing shall
be subject to the prior written approval of Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent shall cooperate
reasonably with the Company in connection with the Companys performance of
its obligations under this Section 5.10. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that, except for settlement of the DB Hedge Transaction, obtaining any
particular outcome with respect to any of the actions requested by the Parent
to be taken pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall not constitute, or be
construed to constitute, a condition to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the failure to obtain any particular
outcome shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 



 

Section 5.11 _No Control of Other Party s Business_.

 



 

Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent the right to
control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give
the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents
or its Subsidiaries operations. Subject to the foregoing covenants, prior to
the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.12 _Third Party Standstill Agreements_.

 



 

From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VII or the Effective Time, the Company shall not
release, terminate, amend or modify any material provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company is a party (other
than involving Parent or its Affiliates), unless the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith after consultation with its independent
outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary for the board of
directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law. During such period, the Company agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreements,
including, but not limited to, seeking injunctions to prevent any breaches of
such agreements or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in
a court in the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction. To the
extent Parent believes that there has been a breach of any such existing
confidentiality agreement by the counterparty thereto, upon Parents request,
the Company shall use such commercially reasonable efforts to enforce such
existing confidentiality agreement.

Section 8.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Venue_.

 



 

Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or any state court in
the Borough of Manhattan, New York (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court
of Chancery or such state court shall be unavailable, the Federal court of the
United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware or the Borough of
Manhattan, New York) for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement (and agrees that no such action, suit or proceeding relating to this
Agreement shall be brought by it or any of its Subsidiaries except in such
courts). Each of the parties further agrees that, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice or
document by U.S. registered mail to such Persons respective address set forth
above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding
in the State of Delaware or New York, as the case may be, with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the
immediately preceding sentence. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to the
laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the Delaware
Court of Chancery or any state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York
(and if the Delaware Court of Chancery or such state court shall be
unavailable, in any other Delaware or New York State court or the Federal
court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware or the
Borough of Manhattan, New York) or that any such action, suit or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action
or other proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in
connection with this Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
Representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such party would not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding,
seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the
other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among
other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 8.10.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Enforcement_.

 



 

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur to Parent and Merger Sub
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court
of Chancery or any state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York (and if
the Delaware Court of Chancery or such state court shall be unavailable, in
the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware or the Borough of Manhattan, New York), this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Company shall not be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof. The Company agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
on the basis that Parent or Merger Sub has an adequate remedy at law or that
any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. In the event that Parent or Merger Sub seeks an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such party shall not
be required to

 



      
 

 



 

provide any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction or
other Judgment. The terms of this Section 8.11(a) shall not be deemed to be
superseded, amended or modified in any respect by the terms of any other
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Consents and Approvals_.

 



 

For any matter under this Agreement requiring the consent or approval of any
party to be valid and binding on the parties hereto, such consent or approval
must be in writing and executed and delivered to the other parties by a Person
duly authorized by such party to do so.

 



 

Section 8.13 _Severability_.

 



 

If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to
any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof.

 



 

Section 8.14 _Lender Provisions_.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each party hereto
agrees (on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its respective Subsidiaries
and Affiliates) that (a) any action, claim, suit, litigation, investigation,
inquiry or proceeding arising against any Lender, any of its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries or any of the respective officers, directors, partners, trustees,
employees, Affiliates, shareholders, advisors, agents, representatives,
attorneys-in-fact and controlling persons of each of the foregoing
(collectively, a " **Lender** **Party** "), or with respect to which any
Lender Party otherwise becomes subject to, arising out of, relating to,
resulting from or otherwise in connection with the Debt Commitment Letters,
the Debt Financing, the use of the proceeds therefrom, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any of the other transactions contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
a state or Federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, or the
State of Delaware and (b) each Lender Party is an express third party
beneficiary of any liability limitations and/or caps (and/or similar
provisions) in this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated by this
Agreement and the foregoing provisions relating to exclusive jurisdiction.
