     | 2. | _THE ACQUISITION_. 
---|---|--- 

2.1  _Purchase and Sale_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall purchase the Shares from the Seller and the
Seller shall sell the Shares owned by it to the Purchaser, free and clear of
all Encumbrances, for the aggregate Purchase Price set forth in Section 2.2.



 

\- 10 - 2.2 _Purchase Price; Closing Adjustment_.

(a) The aggregate purchase price to be paid in cash by the Purchaser for the
Shares (the " _Purchase Price_ ") is: (i) One Hundred Seventy Million Dollars
($170,000,000) (the " _Preliminary Purchase Price_ "), plus (ii) the Final
Working Capital Adjustment, if positive, minus, (iii) the Final Working
Capital Adjustment, if negative and minus (iv) the Company Indebtedness. The
Purchase Price shall be paid as set forth in Section 3.3 and adjusted as set
forth in Section 2.2(b).

(b) The Estimated Closing Working Capital and Closing Date Working Capital
will be calculated as follows:

(i) Holdings will deliver to the Purchaser not less than three (3) Business
Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, a statement, that will set forth a
good faith estimate of the Adjusted Closing Working Capital of Holdings and
its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the anticipated Closing Date
determined in accordance with Schedule A-1 (the " _Estimated Closing Working
Capital_ "). If the Estimated Closing Working Capital is less than the
Working Capital Target, the Preliminary Purchase Price payable at the Closing
as provided in Section 2.2(a) shall be reduced by the absolute value of such
difference. If Estimated Closing Working Capital is greater than the Working
Capital Target, the Preliminary Purchase Price payable at Closing as provided
in Section 2.2(a) shall be increased by the amount of such difference.

(ii) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Holdings shall prepare and
deliver to the Seller (A) a consolidated balance sheet of Holdings and its
Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the " _Closing
Date Balance Sheet_ "), together with the related consolidated statement of
operations of Holdings and its Subsidiaries for the period from October 1,
2009 through the close of business on the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Closing Date Financial Statements_ ") (in each case without giving effect to
the Contemplated Transactions), and (B) a statement (the " _Working Capital
Adjustment Statement_ ") showing in reasonable detail its computation of the
Adjusted Closing Working Capital of Holdings and its Subsidiaries as of the
close of business on the Closing Date (" _Closing Date Working Capital_ ").
The Working Capital Adjustment Statement also shall state the amount by which,
if any, the Company Indebtedness reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet
is greater or less than the amount of Company Indebtedness used in the
calculation of the Purchase Price on the Closing Date. If the Company
Indebtedness reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet is greater or less
than the Company Indebtedness used in the calculation of the Purchase Price,
the Closing Date Working Capital shall be reduced by the amount of such excess
or increased by the amount of such shortfall. The Closing Date Financial
Statements and the Working Capital Adjustment Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Interim Financial
Statements, subject to the exceptions, clarifications and methodology set
forth in Schedule A-1 hereto. The Seller shall have the opportunity to review
any work papers prepared by Holdings in connection with the preparation of
the Closing Date Financial Statements and the Working Capital Adjustment
Statement.



 

\- 11 - (iii) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Working Capital
Adjustment Statement and the Closing Date Financial Statements (the "
_Objection Period_ "), the Seller by written notice to the Purchaser and
Holdings may object to the Closing Date Working Capital as set forth in the
Working Capital Adjustment Statement, setting forth in such notice the
Sellers objection in reasonable detail, specifying the basis for such
objection and the amount in dispute (" _Notice of Objection_ "). If within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Working Capital Adjustment
Statement, the Seller gives a Notice of Objection to Holdings and all matters
set forth therein are not resolved within fourteen (14) days after Holdings
receipt of such notice, the disputed items shall be submitted to Deloitte and
Touche USA LLP (" _D andT_"), or, if DandT is unavailable, another independent
accounting firm of similar standing reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and
the Seller (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). In the event DandT is
unavailable and the Purchaser and the Seller cannot agree on the Independent
Accounting Firm within twenty five (25) days after Holdings receipt of Notice
of Objection, (i) Holdings and the Purchasers regular outside accounting
firms shall jointly pick an Independent Accounting Firm or (ii) if such
outside accounting firms cannot agree on an Independent Accounting Firm within
thirty five (35) days after the Holdings receipt of Notice of Objection, an
applicable Independent Accounting Firm shall be selected in accordance with
the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an independent accounting expert and
not as an arbitrator to resolve, based on presentation by the Seller and the
Purchaser and the terms and provisions of this Agreement and not by
independent review of legal, accounting or factual matters, only those issues
included in the Notice of Objection in dispute. The Independent Accounting
Firm shall afford each of the Purchaser and its representatives and the Seller
and its representatives up to thirty (30) days in the aggregate to present
their positions as to the disputed items. If either party fails to make such a
submission on a timely basis, the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
required to decide without further delay or extension on the basis of the
submissions made to him and the terms of this Agreement. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall resolve all disputed items in a written determination to
be delivered within thirty (30) days following the end of the
submission period, provided, that any delay in delivering such determination
shall not invalidate the award or otherwise deprive the Independent Accounting
Firm of jurisdiction. Such resolution shall be final and binding upon the
parties and shall be reflected in any necessary revisions to the Working
Capital Adjustment Statement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be paid by the Purchaser and the Seller in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on the disputed items resolved by the
Independent Accounting Firm, utilizing the values of such items as initially
submitted by the parties to the Independent Accounting Firm. Such proportional
allocations shall be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm at
the time its determination is rendered on the disputed items.

(c) If the Seller does not deliver a Notice of Objection during the Objection
Period, then the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital as set forth
in the Working Capital Adjustment Statement shall be deemed to have been
accepted. The term " _Final Working Capital_ " shall mean (i) the Closing
Date Working Capital as set forth in the Working Capital Adjustment Statement
if the Seller accepts the Working Capital Adjustment Statement as delivered or
does not deliver a Notice of Objection during the Objection Period, or (ii)
the Closing Date Working Capital determined pursuant to 2.2(b)(iii) above, if
the Seller delivers a Notice of Objection during the Objection Period.



 

\- 12 - (d) If the Final Working Capital is greater or less than the Estimated Closing
Working Capital, then the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be increased by
the amount of the excess or decreased by the amount of the shortfall, as the
case may be, to establish the Purchase Price. Such difference is referred to
herein as the " _Final Working Capital Adjustment_." If the Final Working
Capital Adjustment is positive, it shall be paid by the Purchaser to the
Seller, and if the Final Working Capital Adjustment is negative, it shall be
paid by the Seller to the Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by the Seller or by the
Purchaser, as applicable, as follows: (i) if no Notice of Objection is
delivered by the Seller, the Final Working Capital Adjustment shall be paid
within three Business Days of the earlier of the expiration of the thirty
(30)-day period for delivery of such Notice of Objection and the date of
delivery by the Seller of a notice that the Working Capital Adjustment
Statement will be accepted without objection; (ii) if Notice of Objection is
delivered by the Seller, (x) any net undisputed amount due from the Seller to
the Purchaser or from the Purchaser to the Seller shall be paid within three
(3) Business Days after delivery of such Notice of Objection, and (y) the
remaining amount, if any, due from the Seller to the Purchaser or the
Purchaser to the Seller shall be paid within three (3) Business Days after the
date all disputed items are finally resolved pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(iii).

2.3 _Escrow_. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver to and deposit an
amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Preliminary Purchase Price (the "
_Escrow Amount_ ") in an account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") established by
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the escrow agent (the " _Escrow
Agent_ ") to secure claims by the Purchaser for indemnification pursuant to
Section 11\. The Escrow Agent shall hold, invest and distribute the proceeds
of the Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms and conditions of that
certain Escrow Agreement to be entered into on the Closing Date by and among
the Purchaser, the Seller and the Escrow Agent, substantially in the form of
Exhibit B (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). For U.S. federal Income Tax purposes,
any payment of any Escrow Amount to the Seller will be treated as deferred
Purchase Price and will be subject to imputation of interest under Code §483
or Code §1274\.

2.4 _Withholding_. The Purchaser shall not deduct and withhold from any
consideration deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to the Seller unless
such amounts are required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

Proceeding by or before any Person pending or, to the knowledge of the

Purchaser has no reason to believe that the Financing contemplated by such

forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no conditions precedent to the
obligations of the lenders party to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and
the equity investors party to the Equity Financing Commitment Letters to
provide the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters or that would
permit the lenders party to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and the

the total amount of such Financing. Assuming the receipt of the proceeds
contemplated under the Commitment Letters, the Purchaser has, or 



 

\- 37 -  shall have at the Closing, sufficient immediately available funds to pay, in

10.9 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

(i) The Seller shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all
Tax Returns that are required to be filed (x) after the Closing Date with
respect to any Tax period ending on the Closing Date (" _Final Year Tax
Returns_ ") or (y) prior to the Closing Date (" _Unfiled Prior Year Tax
Returns_ ") and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.
Such Tax Returns, shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practices
except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Laws; provided, that the
Seller shall provide the Purchaser with draft Final Year Tax Returns
and Unfiled Prior Year Tax Returns at least thirty (30) days prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Returns for the Purchasers review and comment. If
Holdings or one of its Subsidiaries has overpaid any Taxes with respect to
such Unfiled Prior Year Tax Returns or Final Year Tax Returns, Holdings or
such Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall designate that such overpayment
shall be refunded to it and Holdings or such Subsidiary, as the case may be,
shall pay the amount of such overpayment to the Seller within three (3)
Business Days after Holdings or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, has
received a refund of such overpayment from the Taxing Authority.

(ii) The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and shall file or
cause to be filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed for or with respect
to Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries for all Tax Periods ending after the
Closing Date and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns;
provided, that the Purchaser shall provide the Seller with draft Tax Returns
for Holdings or its Subsidiaries required to be filed for any Straddle Period
(" _Straddle Period Tax Return_ s") relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period at
least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Straddle
Period Tax Returns for the Sellers review and comment. The Seller shall pay
to Purchaser the amount due with respect to any Straddle Period Tax Returns
relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, not later than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the applicable due date for such Taxes. If the Seller objects to any
amount owed on any such Straddle Period Tax Return with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, the Seller shall, as promptly as practicable, notify
Purchaser in writing that it so objects, specifying with particularity any
such objection and stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such
objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly delivered, the Seller and
the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreement. If
the Seller and the Purchaser have not resolved their disagreement within
fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by the Purchaser of such notice, they
shall refer the matter for resolution to the Independent Accountant, the
decision of which shall be binding on the Purchaser, the Seller, Holdings and
its Subsidiaries. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant
shall be borne by (i) the Seller if the net resolution of the disputed items
favors the Purchaser, (ii) the Purchaser if the net resolution of the
disputed items favors the Seller and (iii) otherwise equally by the Purchaser,
on the one hand, and the Seller on the other hand. If the Independent
Accountant is unable to make a determination with respect to any disputed
item prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing of the Tax Return
in question, the Purchaser may file such Tax Return. Notwithstanding 



 

\- 43 -  the filing of such Tax Return, the Independent Accountant shall make a
determination with respect to any disputed issue and appropriate adjustments
shall be made to reflect such determination not later than ten (10) Business
Days after such decision has been rendered.

(b) _Apportionment of Taxes_. The Seller shall be liable for and shall pay
all Taxes of Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries imposed with respect to,
incurred in or attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Purchaser shall
be liable for and shall pay all Taxes of Holdings and each of its
Subsidiaries imposed with respect to, incurred in or attributable to any Post-
Closing Tax Period. All Taxes of Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries other
than Transfer Taxes or Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts,
which includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_
"), shall be apportioned between the Seller and the Purchaser based upon the
number of days in the taxable period before and after the Closing Date and the
amounts set forth in the current Tax bills. Taxes based on income or receipts
of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries shall be allocated between the Seller
and the Purchaser based on an interim closing of the books as of the end of
the day on the Closing Date. The Seller shall be liable for Taxes of Holdings
and its Subsidiaries that are attributable to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the Purchaser shall be
liable for Taxes of Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries that are
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period beginning on the day
following the Closing Date. The Purchaser and the Seller hereby agree that the
Tax year of Holdings and Penn Foster shall terminate for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes at the end of the day on the Closing Date under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) (and for U.S. state and local
income Tax purposes under any corresponding provisions of U.S. state or local
Tax Law) as a result of the acquisition of the Shares, with items of income,
gain, loss and deduction allocated in accordance with the provisions of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76. The Purchaser and Seller agree to
cause the Subsidiaries that are resident of Canada for purposes of the Income
Tax Act (Canada) (" _Canadian Subsidiaries_ ") to make such elections under
the Income Tax Act (Canada) and all other applicable Canadian Tax Law in their
Tax Returns for the Tax year ending upon the Closing Date, such that
Purchasers acquisition of control of the Canadian Subsidiaries occurs at the
end of the day on the Closing Date.

(c) _Tax Benefit Items_. To the extent permissible under applicable Law,
Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall deduct all Tax Benefit Items on their
Income Tax Returns for the applicable Post-Closing Tax Periods and shall pay
to the Seller the amount of the Tax benefits actually realized by Holdings or
any of its Subsidiaries from the Tax Benefit Items when realized by the
Purchaser in accordance with Section 10.9(d)(iv).

(d) _Loss Carry-Backs_.

(i) If Holdings or one of its Subsidiaries is unable to utilize any deductions
related to Pre-Closing Tax Periods on its Final Year Tax Returns (or, to the
extent applicable, Straddle Period Tax Returns relating to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period) due to the lack of sufficient taxable income, it shall carry back
any losses reflected on the applicable Final Year Tax Return or Straddle
Period Tax Return to prior taxable years to the extent permitted
by applicable Law. Such carry-backs shall be made as promptly as reasonably
practicable and as permitted under applicable Law (using any available short-
form or accelerated procedures) and Holdings or its Subsidiary shall pay to
the Seller the amount of the Tax refund received to which it would be
entitled in accordance with Section 10.9(a)(i) or 10.9(b), as applicable.



 

\- 44 - (ii) To the extent Holdings or one of its Subsidiaries is unable to carry back
any losses (including without limitation, any losses resulting from the
payment of the Employee Sale Bonuses) in accordance with Section 10.9(d)(i),
it shall carry them forward to future taxable years and the Purchaser shall
pay or cause Holdings or one of its Subsidiaries to remit to the Seller
within five (5) Business Days after the filing of the Tax Return for
applicable Post-Closing Tax Period, the amount of the Tax benefits actually
realized as a result of the losses allowed to be carried forward.

(iii) Upon a Final Determination that a carry-back or carry-forward for which
Holdings or one of its Subsidiaries has paid the Seller pursuant to Section
10.9(d)(i) or (ii) is disallowed in whole or in part, the Seller shall
promptly repay to the Purchaser all or the appropriate portion of the amount
so paid to the Seller, together with interest at the federal underpayment of
tax rate of interest and any applicable penalties.

(iv) For purposes of this Section 10.9, the amount of the benefit
attributable to loss carry-forwards or deductions of Tax Benefit Items will be
based upon the difference between net Income Taxes actually paid and the net
Income Taxes that would have been paid without the benefit of the loss carry-
forwards or Tax Benefit Items. Such calculation shall take into account the
cross-deductibility of federal, state and local Income Taxes as well as any
Income Tax detriment including, without limitation, increase in Tax
liability resulting from the receipt of any state or local Income Tax
refunds. The Purchaser shall provide the Seller with copies of all
calculations of actual Tax savings attributable to loss carry-forwards or
deductions of Tax Benefit Items reasonably requested by the Seller to the
extent such calculations relate solely to the determination of the foregoing.

(e) _Tax Contests_. The Purchaser shall inform the Seller of the commencement
subsequent to the Closing Date of any audit, examination or proceeding (" _Tax
Contest_ ") relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which the Purchaser may
be entitled to indemnity from the Seller for Taxes hereunder, and the Seller
shall be entitled to control and conduct those aspects of any such Tax
Contest. With respect to a Tax Contest that the Seller is entitled to control,
the Seller shall have the right to determine, in its sole discretion, such
matters including without limitation: (i) the forum, administrative or
judicial, in which to contest any proposed adjustment, (ii) the attorney
and/or accountant to represent Holdings and/or its Subsidiaries in the Tax
Contest, (iii) whether or not to appeal any decision of any administrative or
judicial body, and (iv) whether to settle any such Tax Contest; provided, that
the Seller shall not enter into any settlement of any Tax Contest or
otherwise compromise any Tax issue in connection with a Tax Contest to the
extent such matters could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the
Purchaser, Holdings or its Subsidiaries in a Post-Closing Tax Period, without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably delayed, withheld or conditioned). The Purchaser, Holdings or any
of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall deliver to the Seller any power of
attorney reasonably required to allow the Seller and its counsel to represent
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Tax Contest and
shall cause Holdings and its Subsidiaries to cooperate fully with the Seller
and its counsel. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.9(e), the
Purchaser shall have the right 



 

\- 45 -  to control any Tax Contest, and resolve and defend against any assessment
for additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods; provided, that
the Purchaser shall not enter into any settlement of any Tax Contest or
otherwise compromise any Tax issue in connection with a Tax Contest that
relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or otherwise adversely affects or could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the Tax liability of the Sellers
without the prior written consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably delayed, withheld or conditioned).

(f) _Elections, Amended Returns, Etc_. Unless required by Law, without the
prior written consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
delayed, withheld or conditioned), none of the Purchaser, Holdings, any
Subsidiary of Holdings or any Affiliate of the Purchaser shall (i) make any
election, (ii) change the tax treatment of any item on (x) a Tax Return filed
after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (y) a
Straddle Period Tax Return, as compared to the treatment of such item on a Tax
Return filed by Holdings or one of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
Date or (iii) file any amended Tax Return or propose or agree to any
adjustment of any item with the IRS or any other Taxing Authority with respect
to any tax period ending on or before the Closing Date or after the Closing
Date with respect to a Straddle Period Tax Return, in each case of clauses
(i) through (iii), that has the effect of increasing the Sellers liability
for any Taxes, reducing any Tax benefit of the Seller or increasing the
indemnification obligations of the Seller.

(g) _Election under Section 338 of the Code_. The Purchaser shall not make,
and shall not cause any of its Affiliates to make, any elections under
Section 338 of the Code with respect to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries.

(h)  _Cooperation on Tax Returns and Tax Proceedings_. The Seller and the
Purchaser agree to reasonably cooperate with each other and shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable,
such information (including access to books and records) and assistance
relating to Holdings and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested in
connection with the filing of any Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes, and shall retain, or shall cause to
be retained, for the appropriate period, any records or information that may
be relevant to any such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other Proceeding.

(i) _Transfer and Similar Taxes_. All real property transfer or gains taxes,
other transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration, stamp and similar
Taxes and fees incurred in connection with this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_
") shall be borne 50% by the Seller and 50% by the Purchaser. The Seller and
the Purchaser shall cooperate in the filing of all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees.

10.10 _Guaranty and Surety Obligations_. Schedule 10.10 sets forth a true and
correct list of all "Scheduled Guarantees". The Purchaser shall, as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
at its own cost and expense the full release of any and all parties liable,
directly or indirectly, under any Scheduled Guarantee; _provided_ , that with
respect to any Guarantee or other similar obligation not set forth on Schedule
10.10, the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause Holdings and its Subsidiaries
not to, renew or exercise an option to extend any Guarantee and/or the
underlying obligations unless the Purchaser, Holdings 



 

\- 46 -  and/or its Subsidiaries obtain a full release of the Seller and/or any of
its Affiliates. The Purchaser shall, to the extent the beneficiary or
counterparty under any Scheduled Guarantee refuses to so release all parties
under such Scheduled Guarantee, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller
and its Affiliates against and reimburse the Seller and its Affiliates for any
and all amounts paid, including costs or expenses in connection with such
Scheduled Guarantees, including the Sellers and its Affiliates expenses in
maintaining any such Scheduled Guarantees whether or not such Scheduled
Guarantees are drawn upon or required to be performed, and shall in any
event promptly reimburse the Seller and its Affiliates to the extent any
Scheduled Guarantee is called upon and the Seller or any of its Affiliates
makes any payment or is obligated to reimburse the party issuing the Scheduled
Guarantee.

10.11 _Access and Cooperation Following the Closing_. Following the Closing

the Seller and its authorized representatives to make copies thereof) to the
extent relating to the business of Holdings and its Subsidiaries (including
their respective successors and assigns, if any) on or prior to the Closing
Date as the Seller may reasonably request for the review and assessment of
the Closing Date Financial Statements and the Working Capital Adjustment
Statement or the institution or defense of any pending or threatened

prior arrangements to be made between the Purchaser and, the Seller and in a
manner which shall to the maximum extent practicable minimize disruptions to
Holdings and its Subsidiaries business and operations.

(b) The Purchaser shall, and shall cause Holdings and its Subsidiaries

10.11(a) above, as well as for investigation of the institution or defense of
any pending or threatened litigation, investigation or proceeding involving
the Seller, Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, whether in connection with
this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions or with operations prior to

following the Closing Date not to disclose or use at any time (and shall
cause each of its Affiliates, advisors, agents and representatives not to use
or disclose at any time) any confidential information concerning the business

Sellers Affiliates, auditors, attorneys, financial advisors and any other
consultants, agents and advisors in connection with any post-Closing matters
hereunder or related to the acquisition by the Seller of Holdings and its

Article 12 hereof, the Seller shall not and shall not permit Holdings or its
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, induce,
facilitate or encourage the submission of inquiries, proposals or offers from

would constitute a breach of this Section 10.13 by the Seller, the taking of
such action by such investment banker or other advisor or representative shall
be deemed to constitute a breach of this Section 10.13 by the Seller for
purposes of this Agreement.

 

10.14 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Purchaser shall not
and shall not permit Holdings and its Subsidiaries (including their
respective successors and assigns, if any) to amend, repeal or modify any
provision in Holdings and its Subsidiaries charter documents or bylaws
relating to exculpation or indemnification of former officers and
directors (unless required by Law), it being the intent of the parties that
the officers and directors of Holdings and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification
to the fullest extent permitted under the Law of its jurisdiction of
incorporation.

(b) The Purchaser agrees that Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall, at no cost
to the Seller, convert its current director and officer liability insurance
policy (the " _Current D andO Policy_"), effective as of the Closing, to a six-
year "run-off" policy for the benefit of the directors and officers of
Holdings and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing
Indemnitees_ "). The run-off policy will provide continuing liability
coverage, equivalent as to limits, deductibles and other features to
the Current DandO Policy, for claims made against the Pre-Closing Indemnitees
during the six (6) years following the Closing Date for actions taken by or
omitted to be taken by them prior to the Closing Date. The run-off policy
shall have a maximum premium of 300% of last years annual premium for the
Current DandO policy.

10.15 _Compliance with WARN Act_. The Purchaser agrees that, for a period of
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, it will not cause any of the employees
of Holdings or its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date to suffer "employment
loss" for purposes of the WARN Act if such employment loss could create any
liability for the Seller, unless the Purchaser, Holdings or its Subsidiaries
delivers notices under the WARN Act in such a manner and at such a time that
the Seller bear no liability with respect thereto.

10.16 _Non-Solicitation_. Subject to Section 12.2, the Seller agrees that
during the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the earlier of
(x) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.2 and (y) the
second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Seller shall not, and shall not
permit any of its respective Affiliates to solicit, encourage or hire any
employee of Holdings or its Subsidiaries to leave the employment of Holdings
or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that the Seller and its Affiliates may hire
employees (x) whose employment was terminated involuntarily by Holdings or
its Subsidiaries or (y) no earlier than six months after such employee
voluntarily terminated his or her employment with Holdings or its
Subsidiaries.



 

\- 49 - 10.17 _Employee Stay Bonuses_. Following the Closing, in the event that the
Stay Incentive Condition for any of the employees listed on Schedule 8.16(g)
and Schedule 8.17(h) is satisfied in accordance with the Penn Foster Bonus
Plan, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller in writing that
such Employee Stay Bonuses are due and payable and such notice (the "Employee
Stay Bonus Notice") shall include (i) the name of the employees of Penn Foster
to whom the Employee Stay Bonuses are due and (ii) the total amount of such
Employee Stay Bonuses as set forth in Schedule 8.16(g) and Schedule 8.17(h)
with respect to such employees. The Seller shall pay by wire transfer to an
account or accounts as designated by the Purchaser or its designee an amount
sufficient to pay the Employee Stay Bonuses (including any corresponding
employer portion of the required payroll Taxes, employment, unemployment,
disability and similar Taxes) in satisfaction thereof no later than 15
Business Days after such employees Stay Incentive Condition has been
satisfied. The failure of the Purchaser to send the Employee Stay Bonus Notice
prior to 15 Business Days after such employees Stay Incentive Condition has
been satisfied shall not relieve either the Purchaser, Penn Foster or the
Seller of any obligations under this Section 10.17; _provided_ , that, the
Seller shall not be obligated to pay any amounts under this Section 10.17
unless and until the Seller has received the Employee Stay Bonus Notice with
respect to such amount.

10.18 _Commitment Letters_. The Purchaser shall comply with its obligations
and enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters in a timely manner and
shall not permit any amendment or modification thereto, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy thereunder, which would have the effect of introducing
an additional condition to such counterparties obligations and/or reducing
the amount of the commitments thereunder. If any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on substantially the same terms (including pricing) in an
amount sufficient to consummate the Contemplated Transactions as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event. The Purchaser shall
deliver to the Seller true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to
which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide the
Purchaser with any portion of the financing necessary to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions. The Purchaser shall give the Seller prompt notice
of any material breach by any party to the Commitment Letters, of which
the Purchaser becomes aware, or any termination of the Commitment Letters.
The Purchaser shall refrain (and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its Affiliates to refrain) from taking, directly, or indirectly, any
action that would result in a failure of any of the conditions contained in
the Commitment Letters or in any definitive agreement related to the
Financing. The Purchaser shall not agree to or permit any material amendment,
supplement or other modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material
provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing that would materially and adversely affect or delay
in any material respect the Purchasers ability to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions, without first obtaining the Sellers prior written
consent. The Purchaser shall cause its Affiliates to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives to, comply with the
terms, and use reasonable best efforts to satisfy on a timely basis the
conditions, of the Commitment Letters, any alternative financing commitments
and any related fee and 



 

\- 50 -  engagement letters. Any material breach by the Purchaser of the Commitment
Letters and/or any related fee or engagement letter shall be deemed a material
breach by the Purchaser of this Section 10.18. The Purchaser shall keep the
Seller informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing and provide copies of all documents related to the
Financing (other than any ancillary documents subject to confidentiality
agreements) to the Seller. The Purchaser will provide to the Seller any
modifications or amendments to the Commitment Letters, or any material notices
given in connection therewith, as promptly as possible (but in any event
within one (1) Business Day). In the event that (i) the conditions set forth
in Articles 4 and 5 have been satisfied (or can be satisfied by the reasonable
best efforts of the Purchaser) and (ii) the conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letters and/or definitive documentation relating thereto or
relating to any alternative financing have been satisfied (or can be satisfied
by the reasonable best efforts of the Purchaser), then the Seller shall have
the right to cause the Purchaser to draw down on its Commitment Letters,
including without limitation, any alternative or other sources of financing.
The Seller agrees to provide, and shall cause its representatives to provide,
at the Purchasers expense, all reasonable assistance to the Purchaser in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing by the Purchaser as may be
reasonably requested by the Purchaser (provided that such requested assistance
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Seller,
Holdings and its Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in meetings,
drafting sessions and due diligence sessions, (ii) furnishing the Purchaser
and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Seller, Holdings and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested by the Purchaser, (iii) providing and executing documents as may be
reasonably requested by the Purchaser (other than any documents or
certificates that will be in effect prior to the Closing Date or any opinions
of counsel or letters entitling any person other than the addressee of any
such opinion of counsel to rely on such opinion), and (iv) cooperating in
connection with the repayment or defeasance of any indebtedness of the
Seller, Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date. In the
event the Closing shall not occur, the Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller
for all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by the Seller in
connection with the Sellers obligations set forth in this Section 10.18.

10.19 _Holdings  Auditors_. From and after the date of this Agreement, the
Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to cause Holdings and its
Subsidiaries and their independent auditors to facilitate on a timely basis
(a) the preparation of financial statements (including pro forma financial
statements if required) as required by the Purchaser to comply with applicable
Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (including the preparation of
audited financial statements for the fiscal years-ended 2006, 2007 and 2008),
(b) the review of any Holdings or its Subsidiaries audit or review work
papers, including the examination of selected interim financial statements and
data, (c) the delivery of such representations from the Holdings or its
Subsidiaries independent accountants as may be reasonably requested by the
Purchaser or its accountants, and (d) the securing of a binding fee commitment
(on terms similar to those in place on the date of this Agreement) with
respect to consents and comfort letters requested by the Purchaser after the
Closing.

10.20 _Change of Name; Use of Marks_.

(a) Within three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date, the Seller shall
change the name of "PENN FOSTER HOLDINGS LLC" and the name of any of its
Affiliates 



 

\- 51 -  (other than Holdings or its Subsidiaries), to remove the words "PENN
FOSTER," any other reference or indicia associated with the Business or
Holdings, and any confusingly similar variations, derivations or
abbreviations of any of the foregoing.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Seller shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates, Subsidiaries, members and shareholders not to, use the words
"PENN FOSTER," any Mark listed on Schedule 8.10(a), any other reference or
indicia associated with the Business or Holdings, and any confusingly similar
variations, derivations or abbreviations of any of the word "PENN FOSTER" in
connection with any business activity anywhere in the world that develops,
markets or otherwise makes available, any product, technology or service that
are competitive with or substantially similar to the products, technology or
services related to the Business.

representations and warranties of the Seller and of the Purchaser contained in
this Agreement shall survive the Closing, subject to the limitations in this
Section 11.2.

(a) _Time Limitations_. No party shall have any liability (for indemnification

(b) _Dollar Limitations - Minimum_. Neither the Seller nor the Purchaser shall

nonfulfillment of any representation, warranty or covenant of the other party
unless and until the aggregate Damages incurred by such party exceeds

(ii) for the Tax Matters, (iii) for claims for indemnification made by the
Seller against the Purchaser with respect to the matters set forth in Section
10.10, or (iv) for claims for indemnification made by the Purchaser against

which the Threshold shall not apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no claim

may be made pursuant to this Article 11 for any claim (or related group of
claims) unless the amount of such claim or group of related claims shall
exceed Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000), and if such claim or group of
related claims does not exceed such amount, the amount of such claim or group
of related claims shall not be considered Damages and shall not be taken into

has been exceeded; _provided_ , that such Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
($25,000) minimum shall not apply to liability for (i) a breach of any

this Article 11, the following shall apply: (i) in the event that Remediation
with respect to a breach of the Environmental Representation is necessary and

only be 



 

\- 53 -  responsible for such Remediation as is required by any Governmental Body
having jurisdiction and authority with respect to such Remediation which
allows for the continued use of the Owned Real Property as it was used at the
Closing (the "Environmental Remediation"), and the Indemnified Party shall, to
the extent commercially reasonable under the circumstances without interfering
with operation or use of the relevant site, allow the Indemnifying Party to
record or implement any deed restrictions and institutional controls necessary
to allow the use of risk-based industrial or commercial cleanup criteria to
the extent permitted by the Environmental Law or Governmental Body having
jurisdiction and authority; (ii) upon written notice to the Indemnified Party,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled (but not obligated), acting promptly,
diligently and in good faith, to principally control, direct and conduct

Bodies, in each case subject to the obligation to reasonably consult with the
Indemnified Party and obtain the consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) with respect to any such settlement
agreements or any other material decisions with respect to such Environmental
Remediation, provided that such Remediation shall not materially interfere
with operation or use of the relevant site; and, (iii) the Indemnified Party
shall reasonably cooperate with, and provide reasonable access to the relevant
property to, the Indemnifying Party in conducting the Environmental
Remediation or responding to or addressing any breach of the Environmental

matter that arises in connection with or is discovered as a result of any
intrusive sampling the Purchaser may conduct after the Closing, except to the
extent that any such sampling is (i) required by Law or any Governmental Body,
(ii) necessary to prevent harm to human health or the environment, (iii)
conducted in connection with normal or routine business operations, including

contained in this Agreement, (a) no breach by the Seller, Holdings or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement
for any purpose hereunder, and neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate of
the Purchaser shall have any claim or recourse against the Seller, Holdings
or its Subsidiaries or their directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
controlling persons, agents, advisors or representatives with respect to such
breach if any of Michael J. Perik, Stephen C. Richards. Anthony J. Bordon,
Neal S. Winneg, Susan T. Rao, Daniel Conrad or any member of the board of
directors of the Purchaser had knowledge of such breach as of the date of this
Agreement and (b) no breach by the Purchaser of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement for any purpose hereunder, and neither the Seller nor any Affiliate
of the Seller shall have any claim or recourse against the Purchaser or its
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling persons, agents,
advisors or representatives with respect to such breach if to the Knowledge of
Holdings such breach occurred on or prior to the date of this Agreement.



 

\- 54 - 11.3 _Procedures with Respect to Third Party Claims_.

(a) Promptly after the commencement of any action or proceeding against
Holdings, its Subsidiaries or any party hereto which could give rise to a
claim for indemnification under Section 11.1 (other than a Tax Contest, as to
which the provisions of Section 10.9 rather than this Section 11.3 shall
apply) (including a pending or threatened claim or demand asserted by a
third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim being a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), the party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
shall give notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") pursuant to Section 11.2 if it wishes to assert a
claim for indemnification under this Article 11; _provided_ , that failure by
the Indemnified Party to promptly notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then
solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is thereby materially prejudiced.
The Indemnifying Party shall then be entitled to participate in such action
or proceeding and, to the extent that it shall wish, to assume the defense
thereof, if (i) the Indemnifying Party provides written notice to such
Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party intends to undertake such
defense and that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party
against Damages resulting from or relating to such Third Party Claim (subject
to the limitations set forth in Sections 11), and (ii) the defense of the
Third Party Claim is conducted actively and diligently by legal counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. For so long as an Indemnifying
Party is entitled to prosecute the defense of such an action, (a) no
compromise or settlement thereof may be effected by the Indemnifying Party
without the Indemnified Partys consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) unless (i) there is no finding or admission of any
violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect
on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party, (ii) the
sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party and (iii) such compromise or settlement contains or serves
to effect an unconditional release (with prejudice) by the Person(s)
asserting such third-party claim to all Indemnified Parties from all Damages
and other liability with respect to such claim and (b) the Indemnifying Party
shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement thereof
effected by the Indemnified Party without its consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld). If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the
commencement of any action and it does not, within twenty (20) days after the
Indemnified Partys notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of
its election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be
bound by any determination made in such action or any compromise or
settlement thereof effected by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party
shall at all times have the right to fully participate in the defense of a
Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense;
provided, however, that if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such
defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice of
counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have
conflicting interests with respect to such Third Party Claim, the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection
with such conflicting interests shall be considered "Damages" for purposes of
this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the Indemnifying
Party be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel per
jurisdiction for the Indemnified Party.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party determines in good
faith that an action (i) has a reasonable probability to materially and
adversely affect such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates other than as a
result of monetary damages; (ii) seeks non-monetary relief; (iii) involves
criminal or quasi-criminal allegations; (iv) relates to the Indemnified
Partys and/or any of its Affiliates on-going relationships with the current
lenders 



 

\- 55 -  of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, employees, customers or suppliers; (v)
involves a Third Party Claim which, upon petition by the Indemnified Party(s),
the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing
to vigorously defend; or (vi) involves Damages that are reasonably expected to
exceed the maximum amount for which such Indemnifying Party could be liable
under this Section 11; such Indemnified Party may, by notice to the
Indemnifying Party, assume at its expense the exclusive right to defend,
compromise or settle such action, but the Indemnifying Party shall have no
liability with respect to a judgment entered in any action so defended, or a
compromise or settlement thereof entered into, without its consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

11.4 _Calculation of Damages_. The amount of Damages payable by an
Indemnifying Party under this Article 11 shall be (a) reduced by any insurance
proceeds received by the Indemnified Party with respect to the claim for
which indemnification is sought (reduced by any related increase in
premiums), (b) reduced by any amounts, when and as, recovered from any third
parties, by way of indemnification or otherwise, with respect to the claim for
which indemnification is sought, net of costs of collection and (c) reduced
by the net amount of any Tax benefits, when and as, actually realized by the
Indemnified Party to the extent the claim for which indemnification is sought
gives rise to a deductible loss or expense. Except with regard to
compensation for claims paid to third parties, Damages payable by an
Indemnifying Party under this Article 11 shall not include punitive damages,
consequential damages or other indirect, incidental or special damages
including without limitation, claims for lost profits or diminution in value.

11.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Any claim or cause of action (whether such claim
sounds in tort, contract or otherwise and including statutory rights and
remedies) based upon, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions or otherwise in respect of the status, operations
or ownership of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, their Business or properties on
or prior to the Closing Date (including without limitation claims under
Environmental Laws and other Laws giving rights to compensation,
contribution or indemnification against the Seller or former or control
Persons of Holdings) must be brought by either party in accordance with the
provisions and applicable limitations of this Article 11 or to the extent
applicable, Section 10.9, which in the absence of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of all parties, their Affiliates, successors and assigns for
any such claim or cause of action.

11.6 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Seller, Holdings and the Purchaser agree
that any indemnity payment made under this Agreement shall, to the extent
permitted by Law, be treated by the parties hereto as an adjustment to the
amount of the Purchase Price.

11.7 _No Additional Representations_. The Purchaser has conducted its own
independent investigation, review and analysis of the business, assets,
liabilities, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of
Holdings and its Subsidiaries. In entering into this Agreement, the Purchaser
acknowledges that it has relied solely on such independent investigation and
not on any factual representations of the Seller and its representatives
(other than those expressly set forth in the Agreement), and that none of the
Seller, Holdings, its Subsidiaries or any other Person has made any
representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding Holdings and its Subsidiaries
furnished or made available to the Purchaser and its representatives, except
as expressly set forth in the Schedules corresponding to Articles 7 and 8 of
this Agreement.



 

\- 56 - 11.8 _Delivery and Release of Escrow_.

(a) To the extent that Purchaser is entitled to indemnification for any
Damages pursuant to Article 11, the Purchaser shall be entitled
to reimbursement solely out of the Escrow Account in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement; provided, however, to the extent that the
Damages exceed the amount remaining in the Escrow Account, arise with respect
to the matters set forth in Section 10.17 or arise after the Indemnity
Expiration Date, the Purchaser may collect such Damages directly from the
Members subject to the limitations, terms and conditions of this Article 11
and Section 13.1.

(b) Pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, Purchaser and the Seller
shall give joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release from the
Escrow Account and pay to the Seller the amounts set forth below at the
following times and subject to the following conditions:

(i) On the Indemnity Expiration Date, the amount remaining in the Escrow
Account minus the aggregate amount of any Good Faith Damages Estimate;

(ii) Within one (1) Business Day after the final resolution of a particular
indemnity claim for which a Good Faith Damages Estimate is retained in escrow
pursuant to clause (b)(i) above, the amount, if any, by which such Good Faith
Damages Estimate in respect of such claim exceeded the final determination of
Damages in respect of such claim.

12.1  _Termination Procedures_. This Agreement may be terminated before the
Closing occurs only as follows:

(a) by written agreement of the Seller and the Purchaser at any time;

(b) by the Seller or the Purchaser upon written notice to the other if any
Governmental Body or Educational Body shall have issued an injunction or order

Transactions and such injunction, order or other action shall have become

being satisfied by the Termination Date, then so long as each of the Seller
and the Purchaser are pursuing the satisfaction of such closing conditions in
good faith and using their respective reasonable best efforts to satisfy such
closing conditions, the Termination Date shall be extended for an additional
sixty (60) Business Days, _provided_ , further that the Agreement may not be
terminated pursuant to this Section 12.1(e) by the Seller if the Sellers,
Holdings or its Subsidiaries material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein shall have been the
proximate cause of the failure of the Closing to be completed prior to such
date.

12.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 12.1, all further obligations of the parties under this
Agreement shall terminate without further liability of any party to another;
_provided_ , that the obligations of the parties under Sections 10.1, 10.2(b),
10.12, this Section 12.2 and Article 13, shall survive termination; _provided
further_ , that a termination under Section 12.1 shall not relieve any party
of any liability for breach of, or for misrepresentation or fraud under, this
Agreement, or be deemed to constitute a waiver of any available remedy
(including without limitation, specific performance pursuant to Section 13.6)
for such breach or misrepresentation or fraud.

---|---|--- 

13.1  _Guarantee of Members_.

accordance with their respective pro rata percentage as set forth on Schedule
X (" _Pro Rata Percentage_ "), agree to guarantee the Sellers indemnification
obligations pursuant to Article 11 (subject to the limitations set forth
therein) only to the extent that any Damages (i) exceed the amount remaining
in the Escrow Account (ii) arise with respect to the matters set forth in
Section 10.17, or (iii) arise after the Escrow Amount has been released in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, provided, that the maximum
liability of each Member shall be limited to the amount of proceeds actually
received by such Member. The Seller shall have full power and authority to

proviso of the preceding sentence, be binding upon the Members, their

notices to be given following the Closing by the Members, may be taken or
given by the Seller, shall be effective if so taken or given by the Seller,
and Purchaser shall be entitled to rely thereon.

(b) The Seller shall not be liable to any Member for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Seller while acting in good faith, and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good
faith. The Members shall severally and _pro rata_ , in accordance with their
Pro Rata Percentage, indemnify the Seller and hold it harmless against
any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith
on the part of the Seller and arising out of or in connection with the

to which such Members maximum aggregate liability shall be limited to the
aggregate amount of proceeds actually received by such Member in respect of
the Purchase Price.

(c) The Seller shall be each Members agent for service of process in
connection with any dispute or claim arising under this Agreement.

validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or other formation.

(ii) _Authority_. Each Member has all requisite power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement. The
execution, delivery and performance by each Member of this Agreement, and the
consummation by such Member of the Contemplated Transactions have been duly
authorized by all necessary action of such Member. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by such Member and constitutes the valid
and binding agreement of such Member, enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization and
other Laws of affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity.

(iii) _Absence of Conflicts_. Neither the execution and the delivery by each
Member of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, shall (a) conflict with or constitute a default (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default)
under any material agreement or commitment to which such Member is a party or
(b) result in the violation of any Law or any judgment, decree, order,
regulation or rule of any court of other Governmental Body applicable to such
Member.

shall be liable for the breach of any other Members representations and
warranties in Section 13.1(d).

exhibits, contains, and is intended as, a complete statement of all of the
terms and the arrangements between the parties with respect to the matters

orally. Neither party makes, and each party hereby expressly disclaims
reliance upon, any representations or warranties with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions other than those set forth herein.

13.3 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party, the other parties shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to
be taken, all such further or other actions, as such other party
may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions.
