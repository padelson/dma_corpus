 PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

This PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of November 4,
2019 (the "Execution Date"), by and between Cordero Energy Resources LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company ("Seller"), and Laredo Petroleum, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Buyer"). Seller and Buyer are sometimes hereinafter
referred to individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."

RECITAL

Seller desires to sell, and Buyer desires to purchase, all of Seller's right,
title and interest in and to certain oil and gas properties and related assets
and contracts, effective as of the Effective Time, for the consideration and
on the terms set forth in this Agreement.

AGREEMENT

For and in consideration of the promises contained herein and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

SALE AND TRANSFER OF ASSETS; CLOSING



1.01 Assets. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, Seller shall sell and transfer (or shall cause to be sold and
transferred) the Assets, effective for certain purposes as of the Effective
Time, to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, pay for, and accept the Assets from
Seller.



1.02 Purchase Price; Deposit. The purchase price for the Assets (the
"Purchase Price") will be an amount equal to the sum of the Base Purchase
Price and the Earn-Out Payment. Contemporaneously with the execution of this
Agreement, Buyer has deposited by wire transfer in same day funds into an
escrow account (the "Escrow Account") established pursuant to the terms of a
mutually agreeable Escrow Agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") an amount equal
to the Deposit Amount. The Deposit Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent,
and if the Closing timely occurs, on or before the Closing Date, the Parties
shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint instruction letter
directing the Escrow Agent to release the Deposit Amount to Seller at Closing,
which Deposit Amount shall be applied as a credit toward the Indemnity Escrow
Amount as provided in Section 1.04(b)(i). If this Agreement is terminated
prior to the Closing in accordance with Section 8.01, then the provisions of
Section 8.02 shall apply and the distribution of the Deposit Amount shall be
governed in accordance therewith. All disbursements by the Escrow Agent from
the Escrow Account shall be made pursuant to joint instructions executed by
Seller and Buyer or, in the absence of such joint instructions, upon the
satisfaction and fulfillment of all the conditions and requirements set forth
in the Escrow Agreement relating to such disbursements in the absence of joint
instructions.



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Subject to any adjustments that may be made under Section 1.05, the "Base
Purchase Price" will be an aggregate amount equal to One Hundred Thirty
Million, Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand and 0/100 Dollars ($130,250,000.00). 

 | 
---|--- 

(b)

|

As additional consideration to Seller hereunder, if and to the extent required
by this Section 1.02(b), Seller shall be entitled to receive from Buyer an
additional cash payment in an amount equal to the Earn-Out Payment, which
shall be paid in accordance with this Section 1.02(b). Subject to the
remainder of this Section 1.02(b), the Earn-Out Payment shall be due and
payable by Buyer to Seller on or before the date that is thirty (30) days
after the NYMEX Settlement Data Date (the "Earn-Out Payment Due Date");
provided, however, that any portion of the Earn-Out Payment submitted to the
Accounting Expert shall be due and payable by Buyer as provided in Section
1.02(b)(i). 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

On or before the date which is ten (10) calendar days following the NYMEX
Settlement Data Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written notification
setting forth the amount of the Earn-Out Payment, together with Buyer's
calculations and supporting documentation with respect to the Earn-Out
Payment. Within ten (10) calendar days following receipt of Buyer's notice,
Seller shall deliver to Buyer a report containing any changes that Seller
proposes to be made in the statement for the Earn-Out Payment. Any dispute
with respect to a portion of the Earn-Out Payment owed hereunder that is not
resolved by Buyer and Seller on or before the Earn-Out Payment Due Date shall
be submitted by Buyer and Seller to the Accounting Expert for binding dispute
resolution in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in
Section 1.05(e), mutatis mutandis. Such dispute shall be submitted by the
Parties no later than five (5) Business Days following the Earn-Out Payment
Due Date. The amount of the Earn-Out Payment determined by the Accounting
Expert in accordance with the terms hereof shall be paid by Buyer to Seller no
later than five (5) Business Days after the Accounting Expert issues a final
decision with respect to the Earn-Out Payment. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

The Parties understand and agree that the contingent rights to receive the
Earn-Out Payment shall not be represented by any form of certificate or other
instrument, (y) Seller shall not have any rights as a security holder of Buyer
as a result of Seller's contingent right to receive the Earn-Out Payment
hereunder and (z) no interest is payable with respect to the Earn-Out Payment. 

 

1.03 Closing; Preliminary Settlement Statement. Subject to Section 8.01, the
Closing shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP at 609 Main
Street, 47th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002 (or remotely, if deemed feasible by
the Parties and as mutually agreed to in writing by the same) on or before
December 12, 2019 (the "Target Closing Date"), or if all conditions to Closing
under Article 6 and Article 7 have not yet been satisfied or waived, within
five (5) Business Days after such conditions have been satisfied or waived,
subject to the provisions of Article 8. The date on which Closing occurs shall
be the "Closing Date". Subject to the provisions of Articles 6, 7, and 8,
failure to consummate the purchase and sale provided for in this Agreement on
the date and time and at the place determined pursuant to this Section 1.03
shall not result in the termination of this Agreement and shall not relieve
either Party of any obligation under this Agreement. Not later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Target Closing Date, Seller will deliver to Buyer a
statement setting forth in reasonable detail Seller's reasonable determination
of the Preliminary Amount (the "Preliminary Settlement Statement"). As part of
the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer shall provide to Seller such data
as is reasonably necessary to support any estimated allocation, for purposes
of establishing the Preliminary Amount. Within two (2) Business Days after its receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer
may submit to Seller in writing any objections or proposed changes thereto and
Seller shall consider all such objections and proposed changes in good faith.
The estimate agreed to by Seller and Buyer, or, absent such agreement,
delivered in the Preliminary Settlement Statement by Seller in accordance with
this Section 1.03, will be the Preliminary Amount to be paid by Buyer to
Seller at the Closing.

income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to such Wells prior
to, on or after the Effective Time), and shall be responsible for (and
entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property Costs attributable to
the Assets and incurred from and after the Effective Time. Buyer shall also be
responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property
Costs paid by Seller prior to the Effective Time in connection with the
Current AFEs. Seller shall be entitled to all production and products from or
attributable to the Assets (other than the Wells and operations covered by the
Current AFEs) prior to the Effective Time and the proceeds thereof, and shall be
responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property
Costs attributable to the Assets incurred prior to the Effective Time (other
than Property Costs paid in connection with the Current AFEs). "Earned" and
"incurred," as used in this Agreement, shall be interpreted in accordance with
GAAP and Council of Petroleum Accountants Society (COPAS) standards.

(b)

|

Without limiting the allocation of costs and receipts set forth in Section
1.05(a), for each Well operated by Seller or its Affiliate, Seller or its
Affiliate shall be entitled to a monthly overhead amount (for the period
commencing from the Effective Time through the Closing Date) equal to
$1,000.00 per month for each Well operated by Seller or any of its Affiliates.
The charges and deductions under this Section 1.05(b) shall accrue from the
Effective Time through the month in which transfer of operations occurs;
provided however, that the overhead charges for the month in which transfer of
operations occurs shall be prorated based upon the number of days in such
month that Seller or its Affiliate operated such Wells.

(c)

|

For purposes of allocating revenues, production, proceeds, income, accounts
receivable and products under this Section 1.05(a), (i) liquid Hydrocarbons
produced into storage facilities will be deemed to be "from or attributable
to" the Wells when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the storage
facilities into which they are run, and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons and liquid
Hydrocarbons produced into pipelines will be deemed to be "from or
attributable to" the Wells when they pass through the receipt point sales
meters on the pipelines through which they are transported. In order to
accomplish the foregoing allocation of production, the Parties shall rely upon
the gauging, metering and strapping procedures which were conducted by Seller
on or about the Effective Time and, unless demonstrated to be inaccurate,
shall utilize reasonable interpolating procedures to arrive at an allocation
of production when exact gauging, metering, and strapping data is not
available on hand as of the Effective Time. Seller shall provide to Buyer
evidence of all meter readings and all gauging and strapping procedures
conducted on or about the Effective Time in connection with the Assets for
purposes of establishing the adjustment to the Base Purchase Price pursuant to
this Section 1.05(c). Asset Taxes shall be prorated in accordance with Section
11.02(b).

any (x) Royalties and (y) third party gathering, processing, transportation

with respect to the Assets for which Seller would otherwise be entitled under
Section 1.05(a);

(e)

|

No earlier than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, but no later than
one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare
and submit to Buyer a statement (the "Final Settlement Statement") setting
forth each adjustment or payment which was not finally determined as of the
Closing Date and showing the values used to determine such adjustments to
reflect the final adjusted Purchase Price based on actual credits, charges,
receipts and other items before and after the Effective Time. Seller shall
supply available documentation in reasonable detail to support any credit,
charge, receipt or other item in such statement. On or before thirty (30) days
after receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller
a written report containing any changes that Buyer proposes be made to the
Final Settlement Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the
reasons therefor together with any supporting information (the "Dispute
Notice"). During such thirty (30)-day period, Buyer shall be given reasonable
access to Seller's and its Affiliates' books and records relating to the
matters required to be accounted for in the Final Settlement Statement to
allow Buyer to conduct an audit and review of such items. Any changes not
included in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed waived. If Buyer fails to
timely deliver a Dispute Notice to Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to
be made to the Final Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as
delivered by Seller will be deemed to be mutually agreed upon by the Parties
and will, without limiting Section 11.02(b) or Buyer's right to indemnity
under Section 9.02 for Seller Taxes, be final and binding on the Parties. Upon
delivery of the Dispute Notice, the Parties shall undertake to agree with
respect to any disputed amounts identified therein by the date that is one
hundred sixty (160) days after the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing Date").
Except for Title Defect and Environmental Defect adjustments pursuant to
Section 1.05(d)(ii)(C), which shall be subject to the arbitration provisions
of Section 10.16, if the Parties are still unable to agree regarding any item
set forth in the Dispute Notice as of the Post-Closing Date, then the Parties
shall submit to an independent, nationally recognized accounting firm mutually
agreed upon by the Parties (the "Accounting Expert") a written notice of such
dispute along with reasonable supporting detail for the position of Buyer and
Seller, respectively, and the Accounting Expert shall finally determine such
disputed item in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Accounting
Expert shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator. In determining the proper
amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price related to the disputed item,
the Accounting Expert shall not increase the Purchase Price more than the
increase proposed by Seller nor decrease the Purchase Price more than the
decrease proposed by Buyer, as applicable. The decision of such Accounting Expert shall, without limiting Section 11.02(b) or
Buyer's right to indemnity under Section 9.02 for Seller Taxes, be binding on
the Parties, and the fees and expenses of such Accounting Expert shall be
borne one-half (1/2) by Seller and one-half (1/2) by Buyer. The date upon
which all adjustments and amounts in the Final Settlement Statement are agreed
to (or deemed agreed to) or fully and finally determined by the Accounting
Expert as set forth in this Section 1.05(e) shall be called the "Final
Settlement Date," and the final adjusted Purchase Price shall be called the
"Final Amount." If (a) the Final Amount is more than the Preliminary Amount,
Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Final Amount, minus the
Preliminary Amount; or (b) the Final Amount is less than the Preliminary
Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Preliminary Amount,
minus the Final Amount. All payments to paid pursuant to this Section 1.05
shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the Final Settlement Date by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified
pursuant to wire instructions delivered in advance by Seller or Buyer, as
applicable.



| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

If, after the delivery of the Final Settlement Statement pursuant to the
provisions of Section 1.05(e), either Party receives monies (including
proceeds of production) belonging to the other Party pursuant to Section
1.05(a) or otherwise (except with respect to any payments that have been
accounted for in the Preliminary Settlement Statement or the Final Settlement
Statement, as applicable), then such monies shall, within five (5) Business
Days after the end of the month in which they were received, be paid over by
the receiving Party to the owed Party. Additionally, except with respect to
any payments that have been accounted for in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement or the Final Settlement Statement, as applicable, if after delivery
of the Final Settlement Statement, (i) Seller pays monies relating to the
Assets that are the obligation of Buyer or (ii) Buyer pays monies relating to
the Assets that are the obligation of Seller, then the Party owing such
obligation shall, within five (5) Business Days after the end of the month in
which the applicable invoice and proof of payment of such invoice are received
by it, reimburse the Party who made such payment therefor. Each Party shall be
permitted to offset any monies owed by it to the other Party pursuant to this
Section 1.05 against amounts owed to it by the other Party pursuant to this
Section 1.05. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the final
accounting for any amounts owing as between the Parties pursuant to this
Section 1.05(f) shall occur on or before the date that is nine (9) months
after the Closing Date (after which date this Section 1.05(f) shall
terminate). 

 

1.06 Assumption. If the Closing occurs, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall assume, fulfill, perform, pay and discharge the following liabilities
arising from, based upon, related to, or associated with the Assets
(collectively, the "Assumed Liabilities") subject to Seller's indemnity
obligations under Section 9.02 (further subject to the limitations and
restrictions in Article 9) but excluding the Specified Liabilities described
in clauses (a), (b), (d) (e), (h) and (i) of the definition thereof: any and
all Damages and obligations, known or unknown, allocable to the Assets prior
to, at, or after the Effective Time, including any and all Damages and

ownership, or operation of the Assets, regardless whether arising before, at
or after the Effective Time, except for Property Costs which shall have been
accounted for as provided under Section 1.05; (b) imposed by any Legal
Requirement or Governmental Body relating to the Assets; (c) for plugging,
abandonment, decommissioning and surface restoration of the Assets, including
oil, gas, injection, water, or other wells and all surface facilities; (d) subject to Buyer's rights and remedies
set forth in Article 10 and the special warranty of Defensible Title set forth
in the Instruments of Conveyance, attributable to or resulting from lack of
Defensible Title to the Assets; (e) attributable to the Suspense Funds, to the
extent actually received by Buyer (or for which a reduction to the Base
Purchase Price was made); (f) attributable to the Imbalances; (g) subject to
Buyer's rights and remedies set forth in Article 10, attributable to or
resulting from all Environmental Liabilities relating to the Assets; (h)
related to the conveyance of the Assets to Buyer at Closing (including arising
from the conveyance thereof without consent or in violation of any
preferential purchase right or maintenance of uniform interest provisions);
(i) attributable to or resulting from (1) Asset Taxes allocated to Buyer
pursuant to Section 11.02(b) (provided that Section 11.02(b) shall govern the
actual payment of such Asset Taxes) and (2) any other Taxes attributable to
the Assets for periods (or portions thereof) from and after the Effective
Time; (j) attributable to or resulting from Transfer Taxes; (k) attributable
to the Leases and the Applicable Contracts; and (l) attributable to the
Assumed Litigation. Buyer acknowledges that: (i) the Assets have been used in
connection with the exploration for, and the development, production,
treatment and transportation of, Hydrocarbons; (ii) spills of wastes,
Hydrocarbons, produced water, Hazardous Materials and other materials and
substances may have occurred in the past or in connection with the Assets;
(iii) there is a possibility that there are currently unknown, abandoned
wells, plugged wells, pipelines and other equipment on or underneath the
property underlying the Assets; (iv) it is the intent of the Parties that,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, all liability
associated with the matters described in clauses (i) through (iii) above as
well as any responsibility and liability to decommission, plug or replug such
wells (including the Wells) in accordance with all Legal Requirements and
requirements of Governmental Bodies be passed to Buyer whether arising prior
to, at, or after the Effective Time, and that Buyer shall assume all
responsibility and liability for such matters and all claims and demands
related thereto; (v) the Assets may contain asbestos, Hazardous Materials or
NORM; (vi) NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials
and equipment as scale or in other forms; (vii) wells, materials and equipment
located on the Assets may contain NORM; and (viii) special procedures may be
required for remediating, removing, transporting and disposing of asbestos,
NORM, Hazardous Materials and other materials from the Assets. From and after
the Closing, regardless of whether arising prior to, at, or after the
Effective Time, subject to Seller's indemnity obligations under Section 9.02
(subject to the limitations and restrictions in Article 9), Buyer shall
assume, with respect to the Assets, all responsibility and liability for any
assessment, remediation, removal, transportation and disposal of these
materials and associated activities in accordance with all Legal Requirements
and requirements of Governmental Bodies.



1.07 Allocation of Purchase Price.



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Assets as set forth in
Schedule 1.07 hereto. Seller and Buyer agree to be bound by the Allocated
Values set forth in Schedule 1.07 for purposes of Article 10 hereof. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

As soon as reasonably practicable following the Final Settlement Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer for its review and approval an allocation of the Final
Amount and any items that are treated as consideration for U.S. federal Income
Tax purposes among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, and
the regulations thereunder, and to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, the amount allocated among the Assets shall be in a manner consistent with the Allocated Values set forth on Schedule 1.07
(the "Tax Allocation"). Buyer shall provide Seller with any comments to the
Tax Allocation within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt by Buyer. If
Buyer does not deliver any written notice of objection to the Tax Allocation
within such thirty (30)-day period, the Tax Allocation shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties. If a written notice of objection is
timely delivered to Seller, Seller and Buyer will negotiate in good faith for
a period of twenty (20) days to resolve such dispute (the "Allocation Dispute
Resolution Period"). If, during the Allocation Dispute Resolution Period,
Seller and Buyer resolve their differences in writing as to any disputed
amount, such resolution shall be deemed final and binding with respect to such
amount for the purpose of determining that component of the Tax Allocation. In
the event that Seller and Buyer do not resolve all of the items disputed in
the Tax Allocation prior to the end of the Allocation Dispute Resolution
Period, all such unresolved disputed items shall be determined by the
Accounting Expert in accordance with the procedures of Section 1.05(e),
mutatis mutandis. Any subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price for U.S.
federal Income Tax purposes shall be allocated in a manner consistent with the
Tax Allocation as finally determined hereunder. Seller and Buyer each agree to
report, and to cause their respective Affiliates to report, the federal,
state, and local income and other Tax consequences of the Contemplated
Transactions, and in particular to report the information required by Section
1060(b) of the Code, and to jointly prepare Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition
Statement under Section 1060 of the Code) as promptly as possible following
the Final Settlement Date, in a manner consistent with the Tax Allocation as
revised to take into account subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price for
U.S. federal Income Tax purposes, and shall not take any position inconsistent
therewith upon examination of any Tax Return, in any refund claim, litigation,
investigation or otherwise, unless required to do so pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of applicable state, local or foreign law) or with the other
Party's prior consent; provided, however, that no Party shall be unreasonably
impeded in its ability and discretion to negotiate, compromise or settle any
Tax audit, claim or similar Proceedings in connection with Tax Allocation.

all such Permits.



2.13 Current Commitments. Schedule 2.13 sets forth, as of the Execution Date,
all approved authorizations for expenditures and other approved capital

terminate, cancel, rescind or procure a reformation of any Lease or any
provisions thereof, or seeking the release of any Lease (or portion thereof).
To Seller's Knowledge, there exists no condition or event which, after notice

sufficient to hold such Lease.



| 
---|---

|

2.16 Knowledge Qualifier for Non-Operated Assets. To the extent that Seller

with matters relating to Non-Operated Assets, each and every such
representation and warranty shall be deemed to be qualified by the phrase, "To
Seller's Knowledge."



2.17 Disclosures with Multiple Applicability; Materiality. If any fact,
condition or matter disclosed in Seller's disclosure Schedules applies to more
than one Section of this Article 2, a single disclosure of such fact,
condition or matter on Seller's disclosure Schedules shall constitute
disclosure with respect to all Sections of this Article 2 to which such fact,
condition or other matter applies to the extent reasonably apparent on the
face of Seller's disclosure Schedules, regardless of the section of Seller's
disclosure Schedules in which such fact, condition or other matter is
described. Inclusion of a matter on Seller's disclosure Schedules with respect
to a representation or warranty that is qualified by "material" or any variant
thereof shall not necessarily be deemed an indication that such matter does,
or may, be material. Matters may be disclosed on a Schedule to this Agreement
for purposes of information only.



ARTICLE 3

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER



Buyer represents and warrants to Seller, as of the Execution Date and the
Closing Date, the following:

3.01 Organization and Good Standing. Buyer is a corporation and duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware
and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the Assets are located.



3.02 Authority; No Conflict.



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer,
enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy or other similar laws
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a Proceeding in equity or at law). Upon the
execution and delivery by Buyer of the Instruments of Conveyance and any other
documents executed and delivered by Buyer at the Closing (collectively,
"Buyer's Closing Documents"), Buyer's Closing Documents shall constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligations of Buyer enforceable against Buyer in
accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy or other similar laws affecting the rights
and remedies of creditors generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a Proceeding in
equity or at law). Buyer has the requisite right, power, authority and
capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement and Buyer's Closing Documents,
and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and Buyer's Closing
Documents.



| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer nor the
consummation or performance of any of the Contemplated Transactions by Buyer
shall give any Person the right to prevent, delay or otherwise interfere with
any of the Contemplated Transactions. 

 

| 
---|---

shall (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of any provision
of the Organizational Documents of Buyer, (ii) contravene, conflict with or
result in a violation of any resolution adopted by the board of managers or
members of Buyer or (iii) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation
of, or give any Governmental Body or other Person the right to challenge any
of the Contemplated Transactions, to terminate, accelerate or modify any terms
of, or to exercise any remedy or obtain any relief under, any agreement or any
Legal Requirement or Order to which Buyer may be subject. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Buyer is not and shall not be required to give any notice to or obtain any
Consent from any Person in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation or performance of any of the Contemplated
Transactions. 

 

3.03 Certain Proceedings. There is no Proceeding pending against Buyer that
challenges, or may have the effect of preventing, delaying, making illegal or
otherwise interfering with, any of the Contemplated Transactions. To Buyer's
Knowledge, no such Proceeding has been Threatened.



3.04 Knowledgeable Investor. Buyer is an experienced and knowledgeable
investor in the oil and gas business. Prior to entering into this Agreement,
Buyer was advised by its own legal, tax and other professional counsel
concerning this Agreement, the Contemplated Transactions, the Assets and their
value, and it has relied solely thereon and on the representations and
obligations of Seller in this Agreement and the documents to be executed by
Seller in connection with this Agreement at the Closing. Buyer is acquiring
the Assets for its own account and not for sale or distribution in violation
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the rules and regulations
thereunder, any applicable state blue sky laws or any other applicable Legal
Requirements. 3.05 Qualification. Buyer is an "accredited investor," as such term is defined
in Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Buyer is not
acquiring the Assets in connection with a distribution or resale thereof in
violation of federal or state securities laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Buyer is, or as of the Closing will be, qualified under applicable
Legal Requirements to hold leases, rights-of-way and other rights issued or
controlled by (or on behalf of) any applicable Governmental Body and will be
qualified under applicable Legal Requirements to own and operate the Assets.
Buyer has, or as of the Closing will have, posted such bonds as may be
required for the ownership or, where applicable, operatorship by Buyer of the
Assets. To Buyer's Knowledge, no fact or condition exists with respect to
Buyer or the Assets which may cause any Governmental Body to withhold its
approval of the Contemplated Transactions.



3.06 Brokers. Neither Buyer nor its Affiliates have incurred any obligation or
liability, contingent or otherwise, for broker's or finder's fees with respect
to the Contemplated Transactions other than obligations that are or will
remain the sole responsibility of Buyer and its Affiliates.



3.07 Financial Ability. Buyer has sufficient cash, available lines of credit
or other sources of immediately available funds to enable it to (a) deliver
the amounts due at the Closing, (b) take such actions as may be required to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions, and (c) timely pay and perform
Buyer's obligations under this Agreement and Buyer's Closing Documents. Buyer
expressly acknowledges that the failure to have sufficient funds shall in no
event be a condition to the performance of its obligations hereunder, and in
no event shall Buyer's failure to perform its obligations hereunder be excused
by failure to receive funds from any source.



3.08 Securities Laws. The solicitation of offers and the sale of the Assets by
Seller have not been registered under any securities laws. At no time has
Buyer been presented with or solicited by or through any public promotion or
any form of advertising in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.
Buyer is not acquiring the Assets with the intent of distributing fractional,
undivided interests that would be subject to regulation by federal or state
securities laws, and if it sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of the
Assets or fractional undivided interests therein, it shall do so in compliance
with applicable federal and state securities laws.



3.09 Due Diligence. Without limiting or impairing any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement and the
Seller Closing Documents, or Buyer's right to rely thereon, subject to Buyer's
rights to access the Assets to conduct a due diligence review in accordance
with this Agreement, prior to Closing, Buyer and its Representatives have (a)
been permitted access to all materials relating to the Assets, (b) been
afforded the opportunity to ask all questions of Seller (or Seller's
Representatives) concerning the Assets, (c) been afforded the opportunity to
investigate the condition of the Assets and (d) had the opportunity to take
such other actions and make such other independent investigations as Buyer
deems necessary to evaluate the Assets and understand the merits and risks of
an investment therein and to verify the truth, accuracy and completeness of
the materials, documents and other information provided or made available to
Buyer (whether by Seller or otherwise). Without limiting or impairing any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this
Agreement and the Seller Closing Documents (including the special warranty of
Defensible Title set forth in the Instruments of Conveyance), or Buyer's right to rely upon each of the foregoing or Buyer's
rights under Article 10, Buyer hereby waives any claims arising out of any
materials, documents or other information provided or made available to Buyer
(whether by Seller or otherwise), whether under this Agreement, at common law,
by statute or otherwise.



3.10 Basis of Buyer's Decision. By reason of Buyer's knowledge and experience
in the evaluation, acquisition and operation of oil and gas properties, Buyer
has evaluated the merits and the risks of purchasing the Assets from Seller
and has formed an opinion based solely on Buyer's knowledge and experience,
Buyer's due diligence, and Seller's representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement and the Seller Closing Documents, and
not on any other representations or warranties by Seller. Buyer has not relied
and shall not rely on any statements by Seller or its Representatives (other
than those representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Seller
contained in this Agreement and the Seller Closing Documents) in making its
decision to enter into this Agreement or to close the Contemplated
Transactions. Buyer understands and acknowledges that neither the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission nor any other Governmental Body has
passed upon the Assets or made any finding or determination as to the fairness
of an investment in the Assets or the accuracy or adequacy of the disclosures
made to Buyer, and, except as set forth in Article 8, Buyer is not entitled to
cancel, terminate or revoke this Agreement, whether due to the inability of
Buyer to obtain financing or pay the Purchase Price, or otherwise.



3.11 Business Use, Bargaining Position. Buyer is purchasing the Assets for
commercial or business use. Buyer has sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that enables it to evaluate the merits and the
risks of transactions such as the Contemplated Transactions, and Buyer is not
in a significantly disparate bargaining position with Seller. Buyer expressly
acknowledges and recognizes that the price for which Seller has agreed to sell
the Assets and perform its obligations under the terms of this Agreement has
been predicated upon the inapplicability of the Texas Deceptive Trade
Practices - Consumer Protection Act, V.C.T.A. BUS and COMM Ann. § 17.41 et seq.
(the "DTPA"), to the extent applicable, or any similar Legal Requirement, and
the waiver of the DTPA, and any similar Legal Requirement, by Buyer contained
in Section 11.04. Buyer further recognizes that Seller, in determining to
proceed with entering into this Agreement, has expressly relied on the
provisions of this Article 3.



3.12 Bankruptcy. There are no bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership or
arrangement Proceedings pending or being contemplated by Buyer or, to Buyer's
Knowledge, Threatened against Buyer. Buyer is, and will be immediately after
giving effect to the Contemplated Transactions, solvent.

COVENANTS OF SELLER



4.01 Access and Investigation.



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Between the Execution Date and the Defect Notice Date, to the extent doing so
would not violate applicable Legal Requirements, Seller's obligations to any
Third Party or other restrictions on Seller, Seller shall (i) afford Buyer and
its Representatives access, by appointment, at such times as Buyer may
reasonably request during Seller's regular hours of business to the Seller-
operated Assets, contracts, books and records, and other documents and data
related to the Assets, together with reasonably appropriate members of
Seller's management and personnel with knowledge of the foregoing, except any
such contracts, books and records or other documents and data that are
Excluded Assets, and (ii) promptly furnish Buyer and Buyer's Representatives,
at Buyer's sole cost and expense, with existing electronic copies of all such
Records, contracts, books and records, and other existing documents and data
related to the Assets as Buyer or Buyer's Representatives may reasonably
request, except for any such contracts, books and records, or other documents
and data that are Excluded Assets (and upon Buyer's request, Seller shall use
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of Third Party operators to give
Buyer and Buyer's Representatives reasonable access to similar information
with respect to Assets not operated by Seller or its Affiliates; provided that
Seller shall not be required to make payments or undertake obligations in
favor any Third parties in order to obtain such consent); provided that,
except as expressly provided in this Agreement or in the Instruments of
Conveyance, Seller makes no representation or warranty, and expressly
disclaims all representations and warranties as to the accuracy or
completeness of the documents, information, books, records, files and other
data that it may provide or disclose to Buyer. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.01(a), (i) Buyer's investigation
shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes interference with the operation
of the business of Seller and any applicable Third Parties, and (ii) Buyer's
right of access shall not entitle Buyer to operate equipment or conduct

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to its right of access to the Records and
the Assets, Buyer will become privy to confidential and other information of
Seller and Seller's Affiliates and the Assets and that such confidential
information shall be held confidential by Buyer and Buyer's Representatives in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. If the Closing
should occur, the foregoing confidentiality restriction on Buyer, including
the Confidentiality Agreement, shall terminate (except as to the Excluded
Assets); provided that such termination of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
not relieve any party thereto from any liability thereunder for the breach of
such agreement prior to the Execution Date. 4.02 Conduct of Business. Except (x) as set forth on Schedule 4.02, (y) for
any operations contemplated in the Current AFEs or (z) as required by
applicable Legal Requirements, between the Execution Date and the Closing,
Seller shall operate its business with respect to its ownership and operation
of the Assets in the ordinary course, and, without limiting the generality of
the preceding, shall:



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

not transfer, sell, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any of the
Assets, except for sales of Hydrocarbons, equipment and inventory in the
ordinary course of business; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

not abandon any Asset; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

---|--- 

(d)

|

not execute, terminate, cancel or materially amend or modify any Material
Contract or Lease other than the execution or extension of a Contract for the
sale, exchange, transportation, gathering, treating or processing of
Hydrocarbons terminable without penalty on ninety (90) days' or shorter; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

not make any election (or fail to make an election, the result of which is) to
go non-consent with respect to any of the Assets; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and effect each
Lease; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

not take, nor permit any of their Affiliates (or authorize any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other Person retained by,
acting for or on behalf of Seller or any such Affiliate) to take, directly or
indirectly, any action to solicit, or negotiate, any offer from any Person
concerning the direct or indirect acquisition of the Assets by any Person
other than Buyer or its Affiliates except for sales of Hydrocarbons, equipment
and inventory in the ordinary course of business; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

use commercially reasonable efforts to keep Buyer apprised of any drilling,
re-drilling or completion operations proposed or conducted with respect to the
Assets; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

notify Buyer of any application for drilling permit by a Third Party affecting
the Assets received by Seller; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(j)

|

not enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing. 

 

Buyer acknowledges that Seller owns undivided interests in certain of the
properties comprising the Assets, and Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions
of the other working interest owners who are not Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller shall not constitute a Breach of the provisions of this Section 4.02,
nor shall any action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute
such a Breach so long as Seller or its Affiliate has voted its interest in a
manner that complies with the provisions of this Section 4.02. Further, no
action or inaction of any Third Party operator with respect to any Asset shall
constitute a Breach of this Section 4.02 to the extent Seller uses
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Third Party operator to operate
such applicable Asset in a manner consistent with this Section 4.02. Seller may seek Buyer's
approval to perform any action that would otherwise be restricted by this
Section 4.02, and Buyer's approval of any such action shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and shall be considered granted
ten (10) days (unless a shorter time is reasonably required by the
circumstances and such shorter time is specified in Seller's notice) after
delivery of notice from Seller to Buyer requesting such consent unless Buyer
notifies Seller to the contrary during such ten (10)-day period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.02, in the event of
an emergency Seller may take such action as reasonably necessary and shall
notify Buyer of such action reasonably promptly thereafter. Any matter
approved (or deemed approved) by Buyer pursuant to this Section 4.02 that
would otherwise constitute a Breach of one of Seller's representations and
warranties in Article 2 shall be deemed to be an exclusion from all
representations and warranties for which it is relevant.

4.03 Insurance. Seller shall maintain in force during the period from the
Execution Date until the Closing, all of Seller's insurance policies
pertaining to the Assets in the amounts and with the minimum coverages
currently maintained by Seller, as set forth on Schedule 4.03.



4.04 Consent and Waivers. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, prior to the Closing, written waivers of all Preferential Purchase
Rights and all Consents necessary for the transfer of the Assets to Buyer;
provided that in the event Seller is unable to obtain all such waivers of
Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents after using such commercially
reasonable efforts, such failure to satisfy shall not constitute a Breach of
this Agreement. Seller shall not be required to make any payments to, or
undertake any obligations for the benefit of, the holders of such rights in
order to obtain the Required Consents. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain such Consents.



4.05 Amendment to Schedules. Until the fifth (5th) Business Day before
Closing, Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to supplement
the Schedules relating to the representations and warranties set forth in
Article 2 with respect to any matters discovered or first occurring subsequent
to the Execution Date. Except to the extent such updates are a direct result
of actions taken with Buyer's express consent pursuant to Section 4.02, no
such supplement shall be considered for purposes of determining if Buyer's
Closing conditions have been met under Section 6.01 or for determining any
remedies available under Article 9 or otherwise under this Agreement.



4.06 Successor Operator. While Buyer acknowledges that it desires to succeed
Seller (or its Affiliates) as operator of those Assets or portions thereof
that Seller (or its Affiliates) may presently operate, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that Seller cannot and does not covenant or warrant that Buyer shall
become successor operator of such Assets because such Assets (or portions
thereof) may be subject to operating or other agreements that control the
appointment of a successor operator. Seller agrees, however, that as to the
Assets that Seller or its Affiliate operates, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to support Buyer's efforts to become successor operator
thereof such Assets (to the extent permitted under any applicable operating
agreement) effective as of the Closing (at Buyer's sole cost and expense) and
to designate or appoint, to the extent legally possible and permitted under
any applicable operating agreement, Buyer as successor operator of such Assets
effective as of Closing.

 4.07 Affiliate Contracts. Seller will terminate or cause its respective
Affiliates to terminate, effective as of the Closing Date, any contracts or
agreements between Seller and its Affiliates insofar and only insofar as such
contracts or agreements relate to or bind the Assets.



ARTICLE 5

5.01 Notification and Cure. Between the Execution Date and the Closing Date,
Buyer may promptly notify Seller in writing and Seller may promptly notify
Buyer in writing if Seller or Buyer, as applicable, obtain Knowledge of any
Breach, in any material respect, of the other Party's representations and
warranties or covenants as of the Execution Date, or of an occurrence after
the Execution Date that would cause or constitute a Breach, in any material
respect; provided that failure to provide such notice shall not limit a
Party's rights or remedies under this Agreement, including under Section 8.01
and Section 9.02, with respect to such Breach. If any of Buyer's or Seller's
representations or warranties are untrue or shall become untrue in any
material respect between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, or if any of
Buyer's or Seller's covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior
to or on the Closing Date shall not have been so performed or observed in any
material respect, and if such Breach of representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement shall (if curable) be fully cured by the Closing (or, if the Closing

|

The Parties understand that none of the insurance currently maintained by
Seller or Seller's Affiliates covering the Assets, nor any of the bonds,
letters of credit or guaranties, if any, posted by Seller or Seller's
Affiliates with Governmental Bodies or co-owners and relating to the Assets
will be transferred to Buyer. On or before the Closing Date, Buyer shall
obtain, and deliver to Seller evidence of, all necessary replacement bonds,
letters of credit and guaranties, and evidence of such other authorizations,
qualifications, and approvals, in each case, as set forth on Schedule 5.02(a)
and necessary for Buyer to own and, with respect to Assets currently operated
by Seller or its Affiliates, operate such Assets. Promptly following the
Closing, Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained, in the name of Buyer,
such insurance covering the Assets as would be obtained by a reasonably
prudent operator in a similar situation.

with such filings. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller
Group from and against all Damages arising out of Buyer's holding of such
title or operatorship of the Assets after the Closing and prior to the
securing of any necessary Consents and approvals of the Contemplated
Transactions from Governmental Bodies. 

 

5.03 Governmental Reviews. Seller and Buyer shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to), in a timely manner, make all other required filings
(if any) with, prepare applications to, and conduct negotiations with Governmental Bodies as required to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions. Each Party shall, to the extent
permitted pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, cooperate with and use
all reasonable efforts to assist the other with respect to such filings,
applications and negotiations. Buyer shall bear the cost of all filing or
application fees payable to any Governmental Body with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions, regardless of whether Buyer, Seller or any
Affiliate of any of them is required to make the payment.

conditions in Article 6 to be satisfied, and (b) Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the conditions in Article 7 to be satisfied.

by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

by Buyer, if Seller has committed a material Breach of this Agreement and such
Breach causes any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article 6 not to
be satisfied (or, if prior to Closing, such Breach is of such a magnitude or
effect that it will not be possible for such condition to be satisfied);

further, that if (i) Seller's conditions to Closing have been satisfied or
waived in full, (ii) Buyer is not in material Breach of the terms of this
Agreement and (iii) all of Buyer's conditions to Closing have been satisfied
or waived, then the refusal or willful or negligent delay by Seller to timely

(c)

|

by Seller, if Buyer has committed a material Breach of this Agreement and such
breach causes any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article 7 not to

possible for such condition to be satisfied); provided, however, that in the
case of a Breach that is capable of being cured, Buyer shall have a period of

|

by either Seller or Buyer, if the Closing has not occurred on or before
December 31, 2019 (the "Outside Date"), or such later date as the Parties may
agree upon in writing; provided that such failure does not result primarily
from the terminating Party's material Breach of this Agreement; or

---|--- 

(e)

|

by either Seller or Buyer, if (i) any Legal Requirement has made the

permanently restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions, and such order, decree, ruling, or other
action has become final and nonappealable. 

 

8.02 Effect of Termination; Distribution of the Deposit Amount. If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01, all further obligations of
the Parties under this Agreement shall terminate; provided that (a) such
termination shall not impair nor restrict the rights of either Party against

except to the extent either Party has received the Deposit Amount (or, with
respect to Buyer, damages in an amount up to the Deposit Amount) as liquidated
damages pursuant to Section 8.02(a), the termination of this Agreement shall
not relieve any Party from liability for any failure to perform or observe in
any material respect any of its agreements or covenants contained herein which
are to be performed or observed at or prior to Closing, (c) except to the
extent either Party has received the Deposit Amount (or, with respect to
Buyer, damages in an amount up to the Deposit Amount) as liquidated damages
pursuant to Section 8.02(a), to the extent such termination results from the
material Breach by a Party of any of its covenants or agreements hereunder,
the other Party shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in
equity with respect to such Breach and shall be entitled to recover court
costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to any other relief to which
such Party may be entitled, and (d) the following provisions shall survive the
termination: Sections 5.01, 8.02, 9.03(b), 9.05, 9.06, 9.07, 9.10, 9.11, 9.12,

(a)

|

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.02: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

If Seller has the right to terminate this Agreement (A) pursuant to Section
8.01(c) or (B) pursuant to Section 8.01(d), if at such time Seller could have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c) (without regard to any
cure periods contemplated therein), then, in any such case, Seller shall have
the right, at its sole discretion to either (1) enforce specific performance by Buyer of this
Agreement, without posting any bond or the necessity of proving the inadequacy
as a remedy of monetary damages, in which event the Deposit Amount will be
applied as called for herein, or (2) if Seller does not seek and successfully
enforce specific performance, terminate this Agreement and receive the Deposit
Amount from the Escrow Agent as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty) free
and clear of any claims by Buyer hereunder. If Seller terminates this
Agreement and receive the Deposit Amount as liquidated damages pursuant to
this Section 8.02(a)(i), then, within two (2) Business Days of such
termination, (x) the Parties shall execute joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to release the Deposit Amount to Seller as liquidated damages via
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated therein
by Seller, (y) all other remedies shall be deemed waived and (z) Seller shall
be free to enjoy immediately all rights of ownership of the Assets and to
sell, transfer, encumber, or otherwise dispose of the Assets to any Person
without any restriction under this Agreement.



| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

If Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement (A) pursuant to Section
8.01(b) or (B) pursuant to Section 8.01(d), if at such time Buyer could have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b) (without regard to any
cure periods contemplated therein), then, in either case, Buyer shall have the
right, at its sole discretion, to either (1) enforce specific performance by
Seller of this Agreement, without posting any bond or the necessity of proving
the inadequacy as a remedy of monetary damages, in which event the Deposit
Amount will be applied as called for herein, or (2) if Buyer does not seek and
successfully enforce specific performance, terminate this Agreement and (in
addition to the Parties executing joint instructions to return the Deposit
Amount to Buyer) seek to recover actual damages from Seller in an amount not
to exceed Buyer's actual documented, out-of-pocket expenses in connection with
this Agreement, but in no case in an amount exceeding the Deposit Amount. If
Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.02(a)(ii)
and seek damages in an amount up to the Deposit Amount, then, within two (2)
Business Days of Buyer's election, (x) the Parties shall execute joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to return the Deposit Amount to Buyer via
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated therein
by Buyer and (y) Seller shall be free to enjoy immediately all rights of
ownership of the Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber, or otherwise dispose
of the Assets to any Person without any restriction under this Agreement. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The Parties recognize that the actual damages for Buyer's material Breach of
this Agreement would be difficult or impossible to ascertain with reasonable
certainty and agree that the Deposit Amount would be a reasonable liquidated
damages amount for such material Breach. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

If this Agreement is terminated by either Buyer or Seller pursuant to Section
8.01 for any reason other than as described in Section 8.02(a), then, within
two (2) Business Days of such termination, the Parties shall execute joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to return the Deposit Amount to Buyer
(free and clear of any claims by Seller thereon) via wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated therein by Buyer. 

 8.03 Return of Records Upon Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement,
(a) Buyer shall promptly return to Seller or destroy (at Seller's option) all
title, engineering, geological and geophysical data, environmental assessments
and reports, maps, documents and other information furnished by Seller to
Buyer in connection with its due diligence investigation of the Assets and (b)
an officer of Buyer shall certify Buyer's compliance with the preceding clause
(a) to Seller in writing.

representations, warranties, covenants, obligations and agreements contained
in the certificate delivered by Seller at Closing pursuant to Section 1.04,
and Buyer releases Seller Group from any and all claims, causes of action,
Proceedings or other legal rights and remedies of Buyer Group, known or

involving a Third Party claim or incurred in the investigation or defense of
any of the same or in asserting, preserving or enforcing any of their
respective rights under this Agreement arising from, based upon, related to or
associated with:



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

any Breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement
or in any certificate delivered by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;

any Breach by Buyer of any covenant, obligation or agreement of Buyer in this

---|--- 

(d)

|

the Assumed Liabilities. 

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and
except for Seller's termination and specific performance rights under Article
8 of this Agreement, the remedies provided in this Article 9 are Seller

collection costs, and excluding the proceeds of any insurance policy issued or
underwritten, or indemnity granted, by the indemnified Party or its
Affiliates).



9.05 Limitations on Liability.



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Except with respect to the Fundamental Representations and the representations
and warranties included in Section 2.04, if the Closing occurs, Seller shall

any Damages with respect to any occurrence, claim, award or judgment that do
not individually exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) net to
Seller's interest (the "Individual Claim Threshold"); or (b) unless and until
the aggregate Damages for which claim notices for claims meeting the
Individual Claim Threshold are delivered by Buyer exceed two percent (2%) of
the unadjusted Base Purchase Price, and then only to the extent such Damages
exceed two percent (2%) of the unadjusted Base Purchase Price. Except with
respect to the Fundamental Representations and the representations and
warranties included in Section 2.04, in no event will Seller be liable for
Damages indemnified under Section 9.02(a) to the extent such damages, exceed
twenty percent (20%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, in no event will Seller's aggregate liability
under this Agreement exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the unadjusted
Purchase Price. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the obligations and rights of
the Parties under Section 9.02 or Section 9.03, and the Damages for which any
Party is obligated to indemnify or entitled to indemnity under Section 9.02 or
Section 9.03 shall be determined and calculated by excluding and without
giving effect to any qualifiers as to materiality or other similar qualifiers
set forth in any representation or warranty (including any bringdown of such
representation or warranty in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement). 

 

9.06 Procedure for Indemnification -- Third Party Claims.



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 9.02 or 9.03 of a
Third Party claim for Damages or notice of the commencement of any Proceeding
against it, such indemnified party shall, if a claim is to be made against an
indemnifying Party under such Section, give notice to the indemnifying Party
of the commencement of such claim or Proceeding, together with a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article
9. The failure of any indemnified party to give notice of a Third Party claim
or Proceeding as provided in this Section 9.06 shall not relieve the
indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article 9, except to the
extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the
indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third Party claim or
participate in the Proceeding or otherwise materially prejudices the
indemnifying Party's ability to defend against the Third Party claim or
participate in the Proceeding.



| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

If any Proceeding referred to in Section 9.06(a) is brought against an
indemnified party and the indemnified party gives notice to the indemnifying
Party of the commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying Party, subject
to its admission in writing that it owes indemnification in respect of the
claim, Damages or Proceeding, shall be entitled to participate in such
Proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying
Party is also a party to such Proceeding and the indemnified party determines
in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the
indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the indemnified
party of its financial capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide
indemnification with respect to such Proceeding), to assume the defense of
such Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party,
and, after notice from the indemnifying Party to the indemnified party of the
indemnifying Party's election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the
indemnifying Party shall not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense,
be liable to the indemnified party under this Article 9 for any fees of other
counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Proceeding,
in each case subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with
the defense of such Proceeding. If reasonably requested by the indemnifying
Party, the indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Proceeding
which the indemnifying Party elects to contest (at the expense of the
indemnifying Party); provided that the indemnified Party shall not be required
to pursue any cross-claim or counter-claim. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume or continue control of the defense of any such Proceeding if (A) such
Proceeding relates to or arises in connection with any criminal Proceeding,
(B) such Proceeding seeks an injunction or equitable relief against any
indemnified Party, (C), in the case of an indemnification claim by Buyer
pursuant to Section 9.02(a) (other than with respect to a Fundamental
Representation) such Proceeding has or would reasonably be expected to result
in Damages in excess of the amount set forth in Section 9.05 (i.e., twenty
percent (20%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price) or (D) the indemnifying Party
has failed or is failing to defend in good faith such Proceeding. If the
indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Proceeding, no compromise or
settlement of such Third Party claims or Proceedings may be effected by the
indemnifying Party without the indemnified party's prior written consent
unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Legal
Requirements or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any
other Third Party claims that may be made against the indemnified party, (B)
the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
indemnifying Party and (C) the indemnified party shall have no liability with
respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third Party claims or
Proceedings effected without its consent. 9.07 Procedure for Indemnification -- Other Claims. A claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party claim may be
asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought.



9.08 Indemnification of Group Members. The indemnities in favor of Buyer and
Seller provided in Section 9.08 and Section 9.03, respectively, shall be for
the benefit of and extend to such Party's present and former Group members.
Any claim for indemnity under this Article 9 by any Group member other than
Buyer or Seller must be brought and administered by the relevant Party to this
Agreement. No indemnified party other than Buyer and Seller shall have any
rights against either Seller or Buyer under the terms of this Article 9 except
as may be exercised on its behalf by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, pursuant
to this Section 9.08. Each of Seller and Buyer may elect to exercise or not
exercise indemnification rights under this Section on behalf of the other
indemnified party affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall have no
liability to any such other indemnified party for any action or inaction under
this Section.



9.09 Extent of Representations and Warranties.



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, except
as and to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the
Instruments of Conveyance, Seller makes no representations or warranties
whatsoever, and except in the case of Fraud, disclaims all liability and
responsibility for any representation, warranty, statement or information made
or communicated (orally or in writing) to Buyer (including any opinion,
information or advice that may have been provided to Buyer or its affiliates
or representatives by any Affiliates or Representatives of Seller or by any
investment bank or investment banking firm, any petroleum engineer or
engineering firm, Seller's counsel or any other agent, consultant or
Representative of Seller). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
except as and to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the
Instruments of Conveyance, and except in the case of Fraud, Seller expressly
disclaims and negates any representation or warranty, express, implied, at
common law, by statute or otherwise, relating to (a) the title to any of the
Assets, (b) the condition of the Assets (including any implied or express
warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or conformity to
models or samples of materials), it being distinctly understood that the
Assets are being sold "As Is," "Where Is," and "With All Faults As To All
Matters," (c) any infringement by Seller of any patent or proprietary right of
any Third Party, (d) any information, data or other materials (written or
oral) furnished to Buyer by or on behalf of Seller (including the existence or
extent of Hydrocarbons or the mineral reserves, the recoverability of such
reserves, any product pricing assumptions and the ability to sell Hydrocarbon
production after the Closing), (e) the environmental condition and other
condition of the Assets and any potential liability arising from or related to
the Assets and (f) the presence or absence of asbestos, norm, or other wastes
or hazardous materials in or on the assets in quantities typical for oilfield operations in the area where the assets are
located.



| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Buyer acknowledges and affirms that it has made or intends to make and prior
to Closing will make its own independent investigation, analysis and
evaluation of the Contemplated Transactions and the Assets (including Buyer's
own estimate and appraisal of the extent and value of Seller's Hydrocarbon
reserves attributable to the Assets and an independent assessment and
appraisal of the environmental risks associated with the acquisition of the
Assets). Buyer acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement, it has
relied or will rely on the aforementioned investigation and the express
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement and the
Seller Closing Documents. Except in the case of Fraud, Buyer hereby
irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any
claim, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced, any Proceeding
of any kind against Seller or its Affiliates alleging facts contrary to the
foregoing acknowledgment and affirmation. 

 

9.10 Compliance With Express Negligence Test. The Parties agree that any
indemnity, defense and/or release obligation arising under this Agreement
shall apply without regard to the negligence, strict liability or other fault
of the indemnified party, whether active, passive, joint, concurrent,
comparative, contributory or sole, or any pre-existing condition, any breach
of contract or breach of warranty, or violation of any Legal Requirement,
except to the extent such damages were occasioned by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the indemnified party or any Group member thereof, it
being the Parties' intention that Damages to the extent arising from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified party or any Group member
thereof not be covered by the release, defense or indemnity obligations in
this Agreement. The foregoing is a specifically bargained for allocation of
risk among the Parties, which the Parties agree and acknowledge satisfies the
express negligence rule and conspicuousness requirement under Texas law.



9.11 Limitations of Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in no event shall Seller or Buyer ever be liable
for, and each Party releases the other from, any consequential, special,
indirect, exemplary or punitive damages or claims relating to or arising out
of the Contemplated Transactions or this Agreement; provided, however, that
any consequential, special, indirect, exemplary or punitive damages recovered
by a Third Party (including a Governmental Body, but excluding any Affiliate
of any Group member) against a Person entitled to indemnity pursuant to this
Article 9 shall be included in the Damages recoverable under such indemnity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, lost profits shall not be excluded by this
provision as to recovery hereunder to the extent constituting direct Damages.



9.12 No Duplication. Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a Breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement herein. Neither
Buyer nor Seller shall be liable for indemnification with respect to any
Damages based on any sets of facts to the extent the Base Purchase Price is
being or has been adjusted pursuant to Section 1.05 by reason of the same set
of facts. 9.13 Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes. Seller and Buyer
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of any anti-indemnity statute
relating to oilfield services and associated activities shall not be
applicable to this Agreement and/or the Contemplated Transactions.



9.14 Waiver of Right to Rescission. Except in the case of Fraud, Seller and
Buyer acknowledge that, following the Closing, the payment of money, as
limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for
Breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein
or for any other claim arising in connection with or with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions. As the payment of money shall be adequate
compensation, following Closing, Seller and Buyer waive any right to rescind
this Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions, except in the case of
Fraud.



9.15 Disclaimer of Reliance on Seller's Methodologies. For the avoidance of
doubt, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer cannot rely on or form any
conclusions from Seller's methodologies for the determination and reporting of
any Asset Taxes that were utilized for any Tax period (or portion thereof)
beginning prior to the Effective Time for purposes of calculating and
reporting Asset Taxes attributable to any Tax period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Effective Time, it being understood that Buyer must make
its own determination as to the proper methodologies that can or should be
used for any such later Tax Return.



9.16 Escrow Claims.



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Subject to the applicable limitations set forth in this Article 9, any amounts
due by Seller to Buyer under this Article 9 shall be first satisfied from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, and thereafter, to the extent that Buyer is
determined to be owed by Seller amounts in excess of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, Buyer may seek payment for such amount from Seller. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

If Seller does not dispute any claim made by Buyer against Seller in
accordance with this Article 9, Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement to disburse to Buyer the amount of the undisputed claim from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount. If Seller does dispute any claim made by Buyer
against Seller in accordance with this Article 9, then upon final
determination of indemnification (or a settlement between the Parties) with
respect to such claim, Seller and Buyer shall provide written instructions to
the Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer the amount determined by such final
determination or settlement to be due and which amount is then remaining in
the Indemnity Escrow Amount. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, on the first
Business Day following expiration of the Indemnity Escrow Period, Buyer and
Seller shall jointly execute and deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to Seller the then-
remaining balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount (and all earnings thereon) in
excess of the aggregate amount of all unresolved or unsatisfied claims for
indemnification that Buyer has made in good faith against Seller on or before
such date pursuant to this Article 9 (if any) (and all earnings thereon) in
excess of the aggregate amount of all unresolved or unsatisfied claims for
indemnification that Buyer has made in good faith against Seller on or before such date pursuant to this Article 9
(if any). From and after such date, the aggregate amount of all unresolved or
unsatisfied claims for indemnification that Buyer has made in good faith
against Seller on or before such date pursuant to this Article 9 (if any) will
continue to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement until such claims have been resolved by the Parties in writing or in
a court of competent jurisdiction and the Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to
be extended accordingly; provided, however, that if, following final
resolution (and payment, if applicable, to the indemnified Person pursuant to
a joint instruction or a final court order, as applicable) of all outstanding
claims against the Indemnity Escrow Amount received prior to the expiration of
the Indemnity Escrow Period, any portion of such Indemnity Escrow Amount
balance remains, then within two (2) Business Days, Seller and Buyer shall
execute and deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement to disburse to Seller any such balance.



ARTICLE 10

TITLE MATTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS; PREFERENTIAL PURCHASE RIGHTS;
CONSENTS



10.01 Title Examination and Access. Buyer may make or cause to be made at its
expense such examination as it may desire of Seller's title to the Assets. For
such purposes, until the Closing, Seller shall give to Buyer and its
Representatives access during Seller's regular hours of business to originals
or copies (including electronic copies if available) of all of the Records,
files, records, contracts, correspondence, maps, data, reports, plats,
abstracts of title, lease files, well files, unit files, division order files,
production marketing files, title opinions, title files, title records,
ownership maps, surveys and any other information, data, records and files
that Seller or its Affiliates have relating in any way to the title to the
Assets, the past or present operation thereof, and the marketing of production
therefrom, in accordance with, and subject to the limitations in, Section
4.01.



10.02 Preferential Purchase Rights. Seller shall, as promptly as practical but
in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the Execution Date,
provide all notices necessary to comply with or obtain the waiver of all
Preferential Purchase Rights which are applicable to the Contemplated
Transactions prior to the Closing Date and in accordance with Section 4.04. To
the extent any such Preferential Purchase Rights are exercised by any holders
thereof, then the Asset(s) subject to such Preferential Purchase Rights shall
not be sold to Buyer and shall be excluded from the Assets and sale under this
Agreement and shall be considered Retained Assets unless and until conveyed to
Buyer in accordance with this Agreement. The Base Purchase Price shall be
adjusted downward by the Allocated Value of the Asset(s) so retained. On the
Closing Date, if the time period for exercising any Preferential Purchase
Right has not expired, but no notice of waiver (nor of the exercise of such
Preferential Purchase Right) has been received from the holder thereof, then
the Asset(s) subject to such Preferential Purchase Right shall be included in
the Closing, with no adjustment to the Base Purchase Price. After the Closing,
if the holder of such Preferential Purchase Right exercises the Preferential
Purchase Right, then Buyer shall convey the affected Asset(s) to such party,
and shall receive the consideration for such affected Asset(s) directly from
such party. If any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right initially elects to
exercise that Preferential Purchase Right, but after the Closing Date, refuses
to consummate the purchase of the affected Asset(s), then, subject to the
Parties' respective rights and remedies as to the obligation to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, Buyer shall purchase such
Asset(s) for the Allocated Value thereof (subject to the adjustments pursuant
to Section 1.05), and the closing of such transaction shall take place on a
date designated by Seller not more than one hundred eighty (180) days after
the Closing Date. If such holder's refusal to consummate the purchase of the
affected Asset(s) occurs prior to the Closing Date, then, subject to the
Parties' respective rights and remedies as to the obligation to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions, Buyer shall purchase the affected Asset(s) at the
Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.



10.03 Consents. Seller shall as promptly as practical, but in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days after the Execution Date, provide all notices and
otherwise initiate all procedures required to comply with or obtain all
Consents required for the transfer of the Assets in accordance with Section
4.04.



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

If Seller fails to obtain any Consent necessary for the transfer of any Asset
to Buyer, Seller's failure shall be handled as follows: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

If the Consent is not a Required Consent and has not been denied in writing,
then the affected Assets shall nevertheless be conveyed at the Closing. Any
Damages that arise due to the failure to obtain such Consent shall be borne by
Buyer, and Buyer shall defend, release, indemnify and hold harmless Seller
Group from and against the same. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

If the Consent is a Required Consent or other Consent that has been denied in
writing, then the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the
Allocated Value of the affected Assets burdened by such Required Consents
(including, with respect to any Required Consent burdening a Lease or
Applicable Contract, all Leases and Wells affected by the Applicable Contract
or Lease for which Consent is refused), and such affected Assets shall be
treated as Retained Assets unless and until conveyed to Buyer in accordance
with this Agreement. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.03(a), if Seller obtains a
Required Consent described in Section 10.03(a)(ii) within one hundred eighty
(180) days after the Closing, then Seller shall promptly deliver conveyances
of the affected Asset(s) to Buyer and Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of the affected Asset(s) in accordance with wire
transfer instructions provided by Seller (subject to the adjustments set forth
in Section 1.05). 

 

10.04 Title Defects. Buyer may notify Seller of Title Defects ("Title Defect
Notice(s)") promptly after the discovery thereof, but in no event later than
5:00 p.m. Central Time on December 9, 2019 (the "Defect Notice Date"). To be
effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and include (a) a
description of the alleged Title Defect and Lease, Well or Mineral Interest
affected by such alleged Title Defect (each, a "Title Defect Property"), (b)
the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (c) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence of the alleged Title
Defect, (d) Buyer's preferred manner of curing such Title Defect, and (e) the
amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title
Defect Property is reduced by such alleged Title Defect and the computations
upon which Buyer's belief is based (the "Title Defect Value"). To give Seller
an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give
Seller, on a weekly basis prior to the Defect Notice Date, written notice of
all alleged Title Defects (as well as any claims that would be claims under
the special warranty of Defensible Title set forth in the Instruments of
Conveyance) discovered by Buyer during the preceding week, which notice may be
preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Notice Date;
provided that the failure to provide any such preliminary notice shall not
affect Buyer's right to assert Title Defects at any time prior to the Defect
Notice Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, subject to
Buyer's rights under the Instruments of Conveyance, Buyer forever waives, and
Seller shall have no liability for, Title Defects not asserted by a Title
Defect Notice meeting substantially all of the requirements set forth in the
preceding sentence no later than 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the Defect Notice
Date.



10.05 Title Defect Value. The Title Defect Value shall be determined pursuant
to the following guidelines, where applicable:



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

if the Parties agree on the Title Defect Value, then that amount shall be the
Title Defect Value; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated in
amount, then the Title Defect Value shall be the amount necessary to be paid
to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

if a Title Defect is based on a Lease that is (i) in its primary term, (ii)
not held by production and (iii) has a primary term expiration date that is
(A) more than fifteen (15) days earlier than the primary term expiration date
set forth on Exhibit A with respect to such Lease and (B) twelve (12) months
or less after the Target Closing Date, then the Title Defect Value shall be
equal to (A) the Allocated Value of such Lease, multiplied by (B) a fraction,
(1) the numerator of which is equal to the difference between (x) the number
of days between the Execution Date and the expiration date set forth on
Exhibit A and (y) the number of days between the Execution Date and the actual
expiration date, and (2) the denominator of which is the number of days
between the Execution Date and the expiration date set forth on Exhibit A; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy where (i) Seller's actual Net
Acres for such Lease as to the Target Depths is less than (ii) the Net Acres
set forth on Exhibit A for such Lease, then the Title Defect Value shall be
the product of the Net Acre deficiency, multiplied by the per-Net Acre
Allocated Value of such Lease; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (i) Seller's Net Revenue
Interest as to the Target Depths for any Lease or the currently producing
formation for any Well and (ii) the Net Revenue Interest set forth in Exhibit
A (for any such Lease) or Exhibit B (for any such Well) and, in the case of
any Well, Seller's Working Interest therein is decreased in the same or
greater proportion, as applicable, then the Title Defect Value shall be the
product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth for in Exhibit A
(for any such Lease) or Exhibit B (for any such Well), as applicable; 

 | 
---|--- 

(f)

|

if the Title Defect with respect to a Well represents an increase of (i)
Seller's Working Interest for such Well over (ii) the Working Interest set
forth for such Well in Exhibit B (except increases to the extent that such
increases are accompanied by a proportionate increase in Seller's Net Revenue
Interest for such Well), then the Title Defect Value shall be the product of
the Allocated Value of such Well, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Working Interest increase and the denominator of which is the
Working Interest set forth for such Well in Exhibit B; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (i) Seller's Net Royalty
Acres for a Mineral Interest as to the Target Depths and (ii) the Net Royalty
Acres set forth on Exhibit A-1 for such Mineral Interest, then the Title
Defect Value shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Mineral
Interest, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Royalty
Acre deficiency and the denominator of which is the number of Net Royalty
Acres set forth for such Mineral Interest in Exhibit A-1; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
then the Title Defect Value shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation. 

 

In no event, however, shall the total of the Title Defect Values related to a
particular Asset exceed the Allocated Value of such Asset. The Title Defect
Value with respect to a Title Defect shall be determined without any
duplication of any costs or losses included in any other Title Defect Value
hereunder, or for which Buyer otherwise receives credit in the calculation of
the Base Purchase Price.

10.06 Seller's Cure or Contest of Title Defects. Seller may contest any
asserted Title Defect or Buyer's good faith estimate of the Title Defect Value
as described in Section 10.06(b) and may seek to cure any asserted Title
Defect as described in Section 10.06(a).



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Seller shall have the right to cure any Title Defect on or before ninety (90)
days after the Defect Notice Date or, if later, after the date of resolution
of such Title Defect or the Title Defect Value by an Expert pursuant to
Section 10.16 (the "Title Defect Cure Period") by giving written notice to
Buyer of its election to cure prior to the Closing Date or, if later, after
the applicable Expert Decision date; provided, however, that if after pursuit
of other remedies reasonably available to Seller to cure any such Title
Defect, Seller reasonably believe that such Title Defect can be cured through
a quiet title or similar Proceeding, then the Title Defect Cure Period with
respect to such Title Defect shall be extended until such quiet title or
similar Proceeding is finally resolved, so long as Seller initiates the quiet
title or similar Proceeding on or before the end of the initial ninety
(90)-day Title Defect Cure Period and diligently and continually pursues such
Proceeding; provided, further, that the Title Defect Cure Period with respect
to any such Title Defect shall not be extended beyond and shall be deemed
terminated effective as of the end of the Indemnity Escrow Period. During the
period of time from Closing to the expiration of the Title Defect Cure Period (or any extended period contemplated by this Section 10.06(a)), Buyer agrees
to reasonably cooperate with Seller, including by giving Seller reasonable
access during normal business hours to all relevant Records in Buyer's or its
Affiliates' possession or control, to the extent necessary or convenient to
facilitate Seller's attempt to cure any such Title Defects. An election by
Seller to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall be without prejudice to the
rights of Seller under Section 10.06(b) or Section 10.16 and shall not
constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of Seller's right to
dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Title
Defect. If Seller elects to cure and:



| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

actually cures the Title Defect ("Cure"), prior to the Closing, then the Asset
affected by such Title Defect shall be conveyed to Buyer at the Closing, and
no Base Purchase Price adjustment will be made for such Title Defect; or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

does not Cure the Title Defect prior to the Closing, then Seller shall: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

if Seller elects to cure the Title Defect, convey the affected Asset to Buyer
and Buyer shall pay the Title Defect Value attributable to the affected Asset
to the Escrow Agent at the Closing; provided, however, that if Seller is
unable to Cure the Title Defect by the end of the Title Defect Cure Period,
then (i) Seller shall include a downward adjustment in the Final Settlement
Statement equal to the Title Defect Value for such Asset and (ii) the Parties
shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release such
Title Defect Value to Buyer; or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

if and only if Buyer agrees to this remedy in its sole discretion, indemnify
Buyer against all Damages (up to the Allocated Value of the applicable Title
Defect Property) resulting from such Title Defect with respect to such Title
Defect Property pursuant to an indemnity agreement prepared by Seller in a
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

If Seller does not elect to cure the Title Defect, subject to Seller's
continuing right to dispute the Title Defect, Seller shall convey the affected
Asset to Buyer at the Closing and the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted
downward by the applicable Title Defect Value for such Asset. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on the existence and Title Defect
Value for all Title Defects. Representatives of the Parties, knowledgeable in
title matters, shall meet during the Title Defect Cure Period for this
purpose. However, either Party may at any time prior to the final resolution
of the applicable Title Defect hereunder submit any disputed Title Defect or
the Title Defect Value to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 10.16. If a contested Title Defect cannot be resolved prior
to Closing, except as otherwise provided herein, (i) the Asset affected by
such Title Defect shall nevertheless be conveyed to Buyer at the Closing; (ii)
subject to the Aggregate Title Defect Deductible, the Base Purchase Price
shall be adjusted downward in an amount equal to the Title Defect Value set
forth in the Title Defect Notice for such contested Title Defect for such
Asset (the "Disputed Title Amount"), which Disputed Title Amount (after taking
into account the Aggregate Title Defect Deductible) shall be deposited into
the Escrow Account at Closing pending final resolution of such Title Defect and (iii) within two (2)
Business Days following final resolution of such Title Defect in accordance
with Section 10.16, Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release the Disputed Title Amount to Seller
or Buyer, as applicable.



10.07 Limitations on Adjustments for Title Defects. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Sections 10.04, 10.05 and 10.06, other than with respect to the
special warranty of Defensible Title to be provided in the Instruments of
Conveyance, Seller shall be obligated to adjust the Base Purchase Price to
account for uncured Title Defects only to the extent that the aggregate Title
Defect Values of all individual uncured Title Defects (after taking into
account any offsetting Title Benefit Values) (the "Aggregate Title Defect
Value"), exceeds the Aggregate Title Defect Deductible. In addition, if the
Title Defect Value for any single Title Defect Property is less than the De
Minimis Title Defect Cost (and the aggregate of all Title Defect Values for
all Title Defects affecting that Property only, or affecting multiple
Properties based upon a single matter creating such Title Defect is less than
the De Minimis Title Defect Cost), such value shall not be considered in
calculating the Aggregate Title Defect Value. Notwithstanding the preceding
provisions of this Section 10.07, (a) the De Minimis Title Defect Cost and the
Aggregate Title Defect Deductible shall not apply to any recovery for a breach
of the special warranty of Defensible Title set forth in the Instruments of
Conveyance, or to any Title Defect submitted pursuant to Section 10.04 that
would have been a breach of Seller's special warranty of Defensible Title set
forth in the Instruments of Conveyance if discovered after the Closing Date
and (b) the De Minimis Title Defect Cost shall not apply to Title Defects
arising under clause (a) of the definition of "Defensible Title".



10.08 Title Benefits.



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

If Seller discovers any right, circumstance or condition that operates (i) to
increase the Net Acres of Seller for any Lease as to the Target Depths to an
amount greater than the Net Acres for such Lease in Exhibit A, (ii) increase
the Net Revenue Interest of Seller for any Lease (as to the Target Depths) or
any Well (as to the currently producing formation) above that shown in Exhibit
A for any such Lease or Exhibit B for any such Well, to the extent the same
does not cause a greater than proportionate increase in Seller's Working
Interest therein above that shown in Exhibit B for any such Well, (iii) to
decrease the Working Interest of Seller in any Well as to the currently
producing formation below that shown in Exhibit B for such Well, to the extent
the same causes a decrease in Seller's Working Interest for such Well that is
proportionately greater than the decrease in Seller's Net Revenue Interest
therein below that shown in Exhibit B or (iv) increase the number of Net
Royalty Acres for any Mineral Interest as to the Target Depths to an amount
greater than the Net Royalty Acres set forth for such Mineral Interest in
Exhibit A-1 (each, a "Title Benefit"), then Seller shall, from time to time
and without limitation, have the right, but not the obligation, to give Buyer
written notice of any such Title Benefits (a "Title Benefit Notice"), as soon
as practicable but not later than 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the Defect Notice
Date, stating with reasonable specificity the Assets affected, the particular
Title Benefit claimed and Seller's good faith estimate of the amount the
additional interest increases the value of the affected Assets over and above
that Asset's Allocated Value (the "Title Benefit Value"). Buyer shall also
promptly furnish Seller with written notice of any Title Benefit (including a
description of such Title Benefit and the Assets affected thereby with reasonable specificity (the "Title Benefit Properties")) which is
discovered by any of Buyer's or any of its Affiliates' Representatives,
employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners. The Title
Benefit Value of any Title Benefit shall be determined by the following
methodology, terms and conditions (without duplication): (A) if the Parties
agree on the Title Benefit Value, then that amount shall be the Title Benefit
Value; (B) if the Title Benefit represents an increase in Seller's Net Acres
as to the Target Depths for a Lease, then the Title Benefit Value shall be the
product of the Net Acre increase with respect to such Lease, multiplied by the
per-Net Acre Allocated Value for such Lease; (C) if the Title Benefit
represents a discrepancy between (1) Seller's Net Revenue Interest for any
Lease or Well as to the Target Depths (for a Lease) or the currently producing
formation (for a Well) and (2) the Net Revenue Interest set forth for in
Exhibit A (for any such Lease) or Exhibit B (for any such Well), as
applicable, then the Title Benefit Value shall be the product of the Allocated
Value of such Title Benefit Property, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of which is
the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property in Exhibit
A (for any such Lease) or Exhibit B (for any such Well), as applicable; (D) if
the Title Benefit represents an increase in Seller's Net Royalty Acres for as
to the Target Depths for a Mineral Interest, then the Title Benefit Value
shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Mineral Interest,
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is Net Royalty Acre increase
and the denominator of which is the amount of Net Royalty Acres set forth for
such Mineral Interest in Exhibit A-1; and (E) if the Title Benefit is of a
type not described above, then the Title Benefit Value shall be determined by
taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property, the
portion of such Title Benefit Property affected by such Title Benefit, the
legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential economic effect of the Title
Benefit over the life of such Title Benefit Property, the values placed upon
the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller and such other reasonable factors as are
necessary to make a proper evaluation.



| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 10.08(a) and 10.08(b), Buyer shall
be obligated to adjust the Base Purchase Price to account for Title Benefits
only as an offset to the aggregate value of any downward adjustment to the
Base Purchase Price for Title Defects calculated pursuant to the terms of this
Article 10. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on the existence and Title Benefit
Value for all Title Benefits on or before the end of the Title Defect Cure
Period. If Buyer agrees with the existence of the Title Benefit and Seller's
good faith estimate of the Title Benefit Value, then, subject to the other
terms of this Agreement, the applicable Title Benefit Value shall be used only
to offset the Aggregate Title Defect Value and will not result in any upward
adjustment to the Base Purchase Price. If the Parties cannot reach agreement
by the end of the Title Defect Cure Period, the Title Benefit or the Title
Benefit Value in dispute shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Section 10.16. If a contested Title Benefit cannot
be resolved prior to the Closing, Seller shall convey the affected Asset to
Buyer and Buyer shall pay for the Asset at the Closing in accordance with this
Agreement as though there were no Title Benefits; provided, however, if the
Title Benefit contest results in a determination that a Title Benefit exists,
then, subject to the other terms of this Agreement, the applicable Title
Benefit Value as determined in such contest shall be used only to offset the Aggregate Title Defect Value and will
not result in any upward adjustment to the Base Purchase Price.



10.09 Exclusive Remedies. Except for the special warranty of Defensible Title
in the Instruments of Conveyance, the representations and warranties set forth
in Section 2.15(a), and without limiting Buyer's remedies for Title Defects
set forth in this Article 10, Seller makes no warranty or representation,
express, implied, statutory or otherwise with respect to Seller's title to any
of the Assets. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyer's sole remedy
for any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of
the Properties (a) before Closing, shall be as set forth in this Article 10
and the condition to Closing set forth in Section 6.07 (if applicable) and (b)
after Closing, shall be pursuant to the special warranty of Defensible Title
in the Instruments of Conveyance. Buyer shall not be entitled to protection
under Seller's special warranty of Defensible Title in the Instruments of
Conveyance against any Title Defect reported by Buyer under Section 10.04.



10.10 Buyer's Environmental Assessment. Beginning on the Execution Date and
ending at 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the Defect Notice Date, Buyer shall have
the right, at its sole cost, risk, liability and expense, to conduct a Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment of the Assets. During Seller's regular hours of
business and after providing Seller with written notice of any such activities
no less than two (2) Business Days in advance (which written notice shall
include the written permission of any applicable Third Party operator or other
Third Party whose permission is legally required, which Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer in securing), Buyer and its Representatives
shall be permitted to enter upon the Assets, inspect the same, review all of
Seller's files and records (other than those for which Seller claims an
attorney-client privilege) relating to the Assets, and generally conduct
visual, non-invasive tests, examinations and investigations. No operation of
equipment or sampling or other invasive inspections of the Assets may be
conducted prior to Closing without Seller's prior written consent, which may
be withheld in Seller's sole discretion. Buyer's access shall be in accordance
with, and subject to the limitations in Section 4.01.



10.11 Environmental Defect Notice. Buyer may notify Seller in writing of any
Environmental Defect (an "Environmental Defect Notice") promptly after the
discovery thereof, but in no event later than 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the
Defect Notice Date. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and
curing alleged Environmental Defects asserted by Buyer, Buyer shall use
reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of each calendar week
prior to the Defect Notice Date, written notice of all alleged Environmental
Defects discovered by Buyer during such calendar week, which notice may be
preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Notice Date;
provided, that the failure to provide any such preliminary notice shall not
affect Buyer's right to assert Environmental Defects at any time prior to the
Defect Notice Date. To be effective, an Environmental Defect Notice shall
include: (i) the Properties affected; (ii) a reasonable detailed description
of the alleged Environmental Defect and the basis for such assertion under the
terms of this Agreement; (iii) Buyer's good faith estimate of the
Environmental Defect Value with respect to such Environmental Defect and (iv)
appropriate documentation reasonably necessary for Seller to substantiate
Buyer's claim and calculation of the Environmental Defect Value.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer forever waives
Environmental Defects not asserted by an Environmental Defect Notice meeting
substantially all of the requirements set forth in the preceding sentence no later than 5:00
p.m. Central Time on the Defect Notice Date.



10.12 Seller's Exclusion, Cure or Contest of Environmental Defects. Seller, in
its sole discretion, and without limiting Seller's right to contest the
existence or extent of any asserted Environmental Defect or Buyer's good faith
estimate of the Environmental Defect Value thereof, (x) may elect to (1)
exclude at Closing any Lease(s) or Well(s) (including, with respect to any
such excluded Well(s), the leasehold rights in and to any Leases insofar as,
and only to the extent the same are required to operate, produce, save, treat
and transport Hydrocarbons from such Well(s)) affected by an asserted
Environmental Defect if the Environmental Defect Value with respect to such
Environmental Defect equals or exceeds the Allocated Value of the affected
Asset(s), and such Lease(s) or Well(s) will become Retained Assets, and (2)
reduce the Base Purchase Price by the Allocated Value(s) thereof, (y) may
convey to Buyer at Closing any Asset affected by an asserted Environmental
Defect and make an accompanying reduction to the Base Purchase Price by
Buyer's good faith estimate of the Environmental Defect Value and/or (z) may
seek to remediate or cure any asserted Environmental Defect to the extent of
the Lowest Cost Response as described in Section 10.12(a); provided that if
the Environmental Defect Value agreed upon by the Parties or finally
determined in accordance with Section 10.16 is equal to or exceeds the
Allocated Value of the affected Assets, then Buyer may elect to exclude such
affected Assets, together with all associated Assets, and reduce the Base
Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of such Assets (which will become
Retained Assets) (provided that if such agreement or final determination
occurs following the Closing, then Buyer shall reassign such affected Assets
to Seller pursuant to an assignment in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Parties and consistent with the Instruments of Conveyance in
exchange for the Allocated Value of such Assets).



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Seller shall have the right to remediate or cure an Environmental Defect to
the extent of the Lowest Cost Response on or before the Closing Date by giving
written notice to Buyer to that effect prior to the Closing Date. If Seller
elects to pursue remediation or cure as set forth in this clause (a), Seller
shall implement such remediation or cure in a manner that is in compliance
with all applicable Legal Requirements in a prompt and timely fashion for the
type of remediation or cure. If Seller elects to pursue remediation or cure
and: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

completes a Complete Remediation of an Environmental Defect prior to the
Closing Date, the affected Lease(s) or Well(s) shall be included in the Assets
conveyed at Closing, and no Base Purchase Price adjustment will be made for
such Environmental Defect; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

does not complete a Complete Remediation prior to the Closing or elects not to
attempt to cure the Environmental Defect, unless Seller elects to exclude such
Lease(s) or Well(s) in accordance with this Section 10.12, then Seller shall
convey the affected Lease(s) or Well(s) to Buyer and the Base Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the remaining Environmental Defect
Value for such Asset(s) (taking into account Seller's partial remediation or
cure of such Environmental Defect, if any). 

 

 | 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on the existence and Environmental
Defect Value of all Environmental Defects. Representatives of the Parties,
knowledgeable in environmental matters, shall meet for this purpose. However,
a Party may at any time prior to the final resolution of the applicable
Environmental Defect hereunder elect to submit any disputed item to
arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 10.16. If a
contested Environmental Defect cannot be resolved prior to the Closing, (i)
the affected Lease(s) or Well(s), as applicable (together with any other
Assets appurtenant thereto) shall be included with the Assets conveyed to
Buyer at Closing; (ii) subject to the Aggregate Environmental Defect
Deductible, the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the estimated
Environmental Defect Value set forth in the Environmental Defect Notice for
such contested Environmental Defect (the "Disputed Environmental Amount" and,
together with any Disputed Title Amount, the "Defect Escrow Amount"), which
Disputed Environmental Amount (after taking into account the Aggregate
Environmental Defect Deductible) shall be deposited into the Escrow Account at
Closing pending final resolution of such Environmental Defect and (iii) within
two (2) Business Days following final resolution of such Environmental Defect
in accordance with Section 10.16, Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release the Disputed
Environmental Amount to Seller or Buyer, as applicable. 

 

10.13 Limitations. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 10.11 and 10.12,
no adjustment to the Base Purchase Price for Environmental Defect Values shall
be made unless and until the aggregate value of all Environmental Defect
Values (the "Aggregate Environmental Defect Value") exceeds the Aggregate
Environmental Defect Deductible. In addition, if the Environmental Defect
Value for any single Environmental Defect is less than the De Minimis
Environmental Defect Cost, such value shall not be considered in calculating
the Aggregate Environmental Defect Value.



10.14 Exclusive Remedies. The rights and remedies granted to Buyer in this
Article 10, the representations and warranties in Section 2.14 (and
corresponding right to indemnity under and Section 9.02(a)) and the condition
to Closing set forth in Section 6.07 (if applicable) are the exclusive rights
and remedies against Seller related to any Environmental Condition, or Damages
related thereto. Except as set forth in this Agreement or in the case of
Fraud, Buyer expressly waives, and releases Seller Group from, any and all
other rights and remedies it may have under Environmental Laws against Seller
regarding Environmental Conditions, whether for contribution, indemnity or
otherwise. The foregoing is a specifically bargained for allocation of risk
among the Parties, which the Parties agree and acknowledge satisfies the
express negligence rule and conspicuousness requirement under Texas law.



10.15 Casualty Loss and Condemnation. If, after the Execution Date but prior
to Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed or damaged by fire or
other casualty or is expropriated or taken in condemnation or under right of
eminent domain (a "Casualty Loss"), subject to the conditions to Closing set
forth in Articles 6 and 7 and Section 8.01, if applicable, this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect, and Buyer shall nevertheless be
required to close the Contemplated Transactions. In the event that the amount
of the costs and expenses associated with repairing or restoring the Assets
affected by such Casualty Loss exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) net to Seller's interest, Seller must elect by
written notice to Buyer prior to Closing either to (a) cause the Assets
affected by such Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored, at Seller's sole
cost prior to the Closing Date, or (b) indemnify Buyer under an
indemnification agreement mutually acceptable to the Parties against any costs
or expenses that Buyer reasonably incurs to repair or restore the Assets
subject to such Casualty Loss. Seller shall assign over to Buyer all rights to
insurance and other claims against Third Parties with respect to any
applicable Casualty Loss except to the extent Seller elects the option
described in clause (a) of the preceding sentence, if applicable.



10.16 Expert Proceedings.



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Each matter referred to this Section 10.16 (a "Disputed Matter") shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA as
supplemented to the extent necessary to determine any procedural appeal
questions by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code),
but only to the extent that such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
Section 10.16. Any notice from one Party to the other referring a dispute to
this Section 10.16 shall be referred to herein as an "Expert Proceeding
Notice". 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The arbitration shall be held before a one member arbitration panel (the
"Expert"), mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The Expert must (a) be a
neutral party who has never been an officer, director or employee of or
performed material work for a Party or any Party's Affiliate within the
preceding five (5)-year period and (b) agree in writing to keep strictly
confidential the specifics and existence of the dispute as well as all
proprietary records of the Parties reviewed by the Expert in the process of
resolving such dispute. The Expert must have not less than ten (10) years'
experience as a lawyer in the State where the Assets giving rise to the
Disputed Matter are located with experience in exploration and production
issues. If disputes exist with respect to both title and environmental
matters, the Parties may mutually agree to conduct separate arbitration
Proceedings with the title disputes and environmental disputes being submitted
to separate Experts. If, within five (5) Business Days after delivery of an
Expert Proceeding Notice, the Parties cannot mutually agree on an Expert, then
within seven (7) Business Days after delivery of such Expert Proceeding
Notice, each Party shall provide the other with a list of three (3)
acceptable, qualified experts, and within ten (10) Business Days after
delivery of such Expert Proceeding Notice, the Parties shall each separately
rank from one through six in order of preference each proposed expert on the
combined lists, with a rank of one being the most preferred expert and the
rank of six being the least preferred expert, and provide their respective
rankings to the local office of the AAA where the Assets giving rise to the
Disputed Matter are located. Based on those rankings, the AAA will appoint the
expert with the combined lowest numerical ranking to serve as the Expert for
the Disputed Matters. If the rankings result in a tie or the AAA is otherwise
unable to determine an Expert using the Parties' rankings, the AAA will
appoint an arbitrator from one of the Parties' lists as soon as practicable
upon receiving the Parties' rankings. Each Party will be responsible for
paying one-half (1/2) of the fees charged by the AAA for the services provided
in connection with this Section 10.16(b). 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Within five (5) Business Days following the receipt by either Party of the
Expert Proceeding Notice, the Parties will exchange their written description
of the proposed resolution of the Disputed Matters. Provided that no resolution has been
reached, within five (5) Business Days following the selection of the Expert,
the Parties shall submit to the Expert the following: (i) this Agreement, with
specific reference to this Section 10.16 and the other applicable provisions
of this Article 10, (ii) Buyer's written description of the proposed
resolution of the Disputed Matters, together with any relevant supporting
materials, (iii) Seller's written description of the proposed resolution of
the Disputed Matters, together with any relevant supporting materials and (iv)
the Expert Proceeding Notice.



| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

The Expert shall make its determination by written decision within fifteen
(15) days following receipt of the materials described in Section 10.16(c)
above (the "Expert Decision"). The Expert Decision with respect to the
Disputed Matters shall be limited to the selection of the single proposal for
the resolution of the aggregate Disputed Matters proposed by a Party that best
reflects the terms and provisions of this Agreement; i.e., the Expert must
select either Buyer's proposal or Seller's proposal for resolution of the
aggregate Disputed Matters. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

The Expert Decision shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right
of appeal, absent manifest error. In making its determination, the Expert
shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Article 10. The Expert may
consult with and engage disinterested Third Parties to advise the Expert, but
shall disclose to the Parties the identities of such consultants. Any such
consultant shall not have worked as an employee or consultant for either Party
or its Affiliates during the five (5)-year period preceding the arbitration
nor have any financial interest in the dispute. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

The Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the
specific matters submitted for resolution herein and shall not be empowered to
award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any
matter. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of preparing
and presenting its case. All costs and expenses of the Expert shall be borne
by the non-prevailing Party in any such arbitration Proceeding.

11.04 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Jury Waiver. This
Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the rights, duties
and the legal relations among the Parties hereto and thereto shall be governed
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, excluding any
conflicts of law rule or principle that might refer construction of such
provisions to the laws of another jurisdiction; provided, however, that any
matters related to real property shall be governed by the laws of the state
where such real property is located. Without limiting the Parties' agreement
to arbitrate in Section 10.16 or the dispute resolution procedures provided in
Section 1.05(e) and Section 10.16 with respect to disputes arising thereunder
or properly subject thereto, the Parties hereto consent to the exercise of
jurisdiction in personam by the federal courts of the United States located in
Houston, Texas or the state courts located in Houston, Texas for any action
arising out of this Agreement, any transaction documents or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby. All actions or Proceedings with respect to,
arising directly or indirectly in connection with, out of, related to, or from
this Agreement, any transaction documents or any transaction contemplated
hereby or thereby shall be exclusively litigated in such courts described
above having situs in Houston, Texas and each Party irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of such courts solely in respect of any Proceeding arising out of
or related to this Agreement. Each Party voluntarily, intentionally and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable legal
requirements, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any
transaction documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. The
Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by law, that a final and
nonappealable judgment against a Party in any action or Proceeding
contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a
certified or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the
fact and amount of such judgment. To the extent that a Party or any of its
Affiliates has acquired, or hereafter may acquire, any immunity from
jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service
or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution,
execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, such Party (on
its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) hereby irrevocably (i) waives
such immunity in respect of its obligations with respect to this Agreement and
(ii) submits to the personal jurisdiction of any court described in this
Section 11.04.



11.05 Further Assurances. The Parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to
each other such further information, (b) to execute, acknowledge and deliver
to each other such other documents and (c) to do such other acts and things,
all as the other Party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out
the intent of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.



11.06 Waiver. The rights and remedies of the Parties are cumulative and not
alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by either Party in exercising
any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred
to in this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right, power or
privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or
privilege shall preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or
privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement, (a) no claim or
right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement can be discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or
renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other
Party, (b) no waiver that may be given by a Party shall be applicable except
in the specific instance for which it is given, and (c) no notice to or demand
on one Party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such Party or
of the right of the Party giving such notice or demand to take further action
without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents
referred to in this Agreement.



11.07 Entire Agreement and Modification. This Agreement supersedes all prior
discussions, communications and agreements (whether oral or written) between
the Parties with respect to its subject matter and constitutes (along with the
documents referred to in this Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement
between the Parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not
be amended or otherwise modified except by a written agreement executed by
both Parties. No representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement has been made by either
Party that is not embodied in this Agreement together with the documents,
instruments and writings that are delivered pursuant hereto, and neither Party
shall be bound by or liable for any alleged representation, promise,
inducement or statement of intention not so set forth. In the event of a
conflict between the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the terms and
provisions of any Schedule or Exhibit hereto, the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall govern, control and prevail.



11.08 Assignments, Successors and No Third Party Rights. Neither Party may
assign any of its rights, liabilities, covenants or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent
may be granted or denied at the sole discretion of the other Party), and (a)
any assignment made without such consent shall be void, and (b) in the event
of such consent, such assignment nevertheless shall not relieve such assigning
Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of
the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties. Nothing expressed or
referred to in this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein shall
be construed to give any Person other than the Parties and their permitted
assignees (and Buyer Group and Seller Group who are entitled to
indemnification under Article 9), any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement, any other
agreement contemplated herein, and all provisions and conditions hereof and
thereof, are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Parties and such other
agreements (and Buyer Group and Seller Group who are entitled to
indemnification under Article 9), and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.



11.09 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.



11.10 Article and Section Headings, Construction. The headings of Sections,
Articles, Exhibits and Schedules in this Agreement are provided for
convenience only and shall not affect its construction or interpretation. All
references to "Section," "Article," "Exhibit," or "Schedule" refer to the
corresponding Section, Article, Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement. Unless
expressly provided to the contrary, the words "hereunder," "hereof," "herein,"
and words of similar import are references to this Agreement as a whole and
not any particular Section, Article, Exhibit, Schedule or other provision of
this Agreement. Each definition of a defined term herein shall be equally
applicable both to the singular and the plural forms of the term so defined.
All words used in this Agreement shall be construed to be of such gender or
number, as the circumstances require. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the
word "including" does not limit the preceding words or terms and (in its
various forms) means including without limitation. If a date specified herein
for giving any notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the
period during which any notice is required to be given or any action taken
expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then the date for giving such
notice or taking such action (and the expiration date of such period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be the next
day which is a Business Day. Each Party has had substantial input into the
drafting and preparation of this Agreement and has had the opportunity to
exercise business discretion in relation to the negotiation of the details of
the Contemplated Transactions. This Agreement is the result of arm's-length
negotiations from equal bargaining positions. This Agreement shall not be
construed against either Party, and no consideration shall be given or
presumption made on the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any particular
provision hereof or who supplied the form of Agreement.



11.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by
facsimile or e-mail transmission) in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which,
when taken together, shall be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.



11.12 Press Release, News Media and External Statements. Except as required by
applicable Legal Requirements or the rules and regulations of any stock
exchange or national market system upon which the securities of Buyer are
listed, neither Party shall issue or make any press release or any other
public or private announcement or statement, in any form of media concerning
this Agreement (or otherwise disclose the terms of this Agreement) or the
Contemplated Transactions that discloses the name of the other Party or its
Affiliate, sponsors or investors without the prior written consent of the
other Party, which consent may be withheld for any reason or without reason;
provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may provide information
about this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions to the public through
investor conferences and presentations, which may be made available on Buyer's
corporate website. Not less than five (5) days prior to issuing or making any
press release or any other public or private announcement or statement, in any
form of media concerning this Agreement (or otherwise disclosing the terms of
this Agreement) or the Contemplated Transactions, in each case, that discloses
the name of the other Party or its Affiliates, sponsors or investors in
accordance with this Section 11.12, the publishing Party shall provide the
non-publishing Party with such release, announcement or disclosure and shall
incorporate any reasonable comments requested by the non-publishing Party into
such release, announcement or disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, except as may be required by applicable Legal Requirements,
neither Buyer nor Seller shall disclose the name of the other Party or the
names of any of such other Party's Affiliates, sponsors or investors, in any
public release or announcement without the prior written consent of the other
Party (which consent may be withheld for any reason or without reason). Seller
and Buyer shall each be liable for the compliance of their respective
Affiliates with the terms of this Section 11.12.

thereafter be of no further force or effect. Each Party shall keep

Appendix I-12

* * *



number of acres in the Lands covered by such Lease, multiplied by (b) the
undivided fee simple mineral interest (expressed as a percentage) in the Lands
covered by that Lease (as determined by aggregating the fee simple mineral
interests owned by each lessor of that Lease in the Lands), multiplied by (c)
Seller's undivided percentage interest that is burdened with the obligation to
bear and pay costs and expenses in that Lease; provided that if the items in
(b) or (c) vary as to different tracts covered by that Lease, a separate
calculation shall be done for each such tract. For example, if a Lease in
which Seller owns an undivided fifty percent (50%) working interest covers a
20-acre tract in which the lessors of such Lease own an undivided one-half
(1/2) fee mineral interest and a separate and distinct 40-acre tract in which
the lessors of such Lease own an undivided one fourth (1/4) fee mineral
interest, then the Lease would cover ten (10) Net Acres (i.e., (20 × 0.5 ×
0.5) + (40 × 0.25 × 0.5) = 10).

"Net Mineral Acre" -- means, with respect to and as computed separately for
each Mineral Interest, the net acreage owned by Seller relative to the total
gross acres in a given tract of land (as to the Target Depths) based on
Seller's undivided interest in such tract. For example, the Net Mineral Acres
for a given tract is computed as (a) the number of gross acres of land
included in tract, multiplied by (b) Seller's net undivided interest in and to
the mineral estate of such fee tract.

"Net Revenue Interest" -- with respect to any Lease or Well, the interest in
and to all Hydrocarbons produced, saved and sold from or allocated to such
Well (in each case, limited to Target Depths for any such Lease and to the
currently producing formation for any such Well, and subject to any
reservations, limitations or depth restrictions described in Exhibit A for any
such Lease or Exhibit B for any such Well), after satisfaction of all other
Royalties.

"Net Royalty Acre" -- with respect to and as computed separately for each
Mineral Interest on Exhibit A-1, the number of Net Mineral Acres (or Net
Acres, as applicable) in a given tract of land (as to the Target Depths) for
which Seller is entitled to all of the Hydrocarbons produced therefrom (or the
proceeds from the sale thereof) on a non-cost bearing basis by virtue of its
ownership of such Mineral Interest. For example (and not by way of limitation
with respect to other types of Mineral Interests), Net Royalty Acres may be
calculated in one of the following ways (as applicable):

(a) with respect to an overriding royalty interest, (i) the number of Net
Acres covered by the applicable oil and gas lease as to the Target Depths,
multiplied by (ii) the overriding royalty percentage in and to such oil and
gas lease conveyed to Seller, multiplied by (iii) eight (8); or

(b) with respect to leased fee minerals, (i) the number of Net Mineral Acres
covered by the applicable oil and gas lease as to the Target Depths,
multiplied by (ii) Seller's net royalty percentage under such oil and gas
lease ("net" meaning net of any non-participating royalty interest or similar
burden held by Third Parties); multiplied by (iii) eight (8); or

(c) with respect to unleased fee minerals, (i) the number of Net Mineral
Acres in the applicable fee tract, multiplied by (ii) a deemed lessor's
royalty of 25% net of any non-



Appendix I-13

participating royalty interest or similar burden held by Third Parties,
multiplied by (iii) eight (8).
