consideration otherwise paid or delivered in connection with the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, to any Person such amounts that Buyer and the
Company are required to deduct and withhold with respect to any such
deliveries and payments under the Code or any provision of state, local,
provincial or foreign law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer

Section 4.9 _Review of Delivered Statements; Dispute Resolution_. With respect
to (a) the Closing Balance Sheet to be delivered pursuant to _Section
4.5(a)_ and (b) any statement or calculation to be delivered pursuant to
_Schedule 4.7_ (each, a " _Delivered Calculation_ "), after delivery of each
Delivered Calculation to Seller, Seller and/or a firm of independent public
accountants designated by Seller (" _Seller s Accountants_") will be entitled
to reasonable access during normal business hours to the relevant records and
working papers of the Company and its accountants to aid in their review of
each Delivered Calculation. Each Delivered Calculation will be deemed to be
accepted by Seller and shall be conclusive for purposes of determining the
Adjustment Amount, in the case of the Closing Balance Sheet, and the release
of the Client Escrow Amount, pursuant to _Schedule 4.7_ , except to the
extent, if any, that Seller shall have delivered within thirty (30) days after
the date on which the applicable Delivered Calculation is delivered to
Seller, a written notice to Buyer stating each and every item to which Seller
takes exception, specifying in reasonable detail the nature and extent of any
such exception (it being understood that any portion of the Adjustment
Amount, in the case of the Closing Balance Sheet, that is not disputed shall
be paid promptly). If a change proposed by Seller is disputed by Buyer, then
Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If,
after a period of twenty (20) days following the date on which Seller gives
Buyer notice of any such proposed change, any such proposed change still
remains disputed, then Buyer and Seller shall

 



5  together choose an independent firm of public accountants of nationally-
recognized standing (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve any remaining
disputes. The Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based
solely on presentations by Buyer and Seller, and not by independent review,
only those issues still in dispute between Buyer and Seller. The decision of
the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding and shall be in accordance
with the provisions of this _Section 4.9_. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be paid inverse pro rata by Buyer and Seller based on
the final position of each of Buyer and Seller as submitted to the Accounting
Firm relating to the Accounting Firms final determination.

_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer does not agree to indemnify and hold
harmless any Seller Group Member from or against any Losses incurred in
connection with or arising from Taxes for which Seller is liable under
_Section 8.1(a)(i)_.

(iii) Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of a
Taxpayer for a Straddle Period, the determination of such Taxes for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of
the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall (A) in the case of
_ad valorem_ or property Taxes, be determined by multiplying the amount of
such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period before and
including the Closing Date or the number of calendar days in the Straddle
Period after the Closing Date, as the case may be, and the denominator of
which is the total number of calendar days in the Straddle Period (provided,
however, that no ad valorem or property Tax attributable to property that was
not held during the portion of the Straddle Period ending on or before the
Closing shall be allocable to the taxable period that is deemed to end on the
Closing Date, and no ad valorem or property Tax attributable to property that
was not held during the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing shall be allocable to the taxable period that is deemed to begin
after the Closing Date), and (B) in the case of all other Taxes, be determined
by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two (2) taxable years or
periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which
began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of
income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Company for the Straddle Period
shall be allocated between such two (2) taxable years or periods on
a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company were
closed at the close of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (I)
Taxes attributable to any transaction that occurs on the Closing Date
but after Closing that is

 



36  not in the Ordinary Course of Business and is not contemplated by this
Agreement shall be allocated to the taxable year or period that is deemed to
begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date and (II)
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis,
such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned between such two
taxable years or periods on a daily basis.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) Seller agrees to pay
any Transfer Taxes imposed on the Special Distribution and (B) Seller, on the
one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, agree to each pay fifty percent (50%)
of any Transfer Taxes imposed on the transfer of the Shares and the Section
338(h)(10) Elections.

 

(b) _Tax Returns_.

(i) Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking into
account all extensions properly obtained) (A) all Income Tax Returns required
to be filed by, with respect to or that include a Taxpayer for taxable years
or periods of the Taxpayers ending on or prior to the Closing Date and (B) all
other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the
Taxpayers on or prior to the Closing Date. In each case, Seller shall remit,
or cause to be remitted, any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. To the
extent such Tax Returns relate to the Taxpayers, Seller shall file such Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with past practice and no position shall be
taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions
taken, elections made or methods used in prior periods in filing such Tax
Returns, except as otherwise required by applicable law, in each case to the
extent failing to do so would reasonably be expected to result in an increase
in the taxable income of any Taxpayer in a Post-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period or an increase in the Taxes payable by a Taxpayer in a Post-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period. With respect to any Income Tax Return that is not
consolidated, combined or unitary Income Tax Return of any Tax Group to be
filed by Seller after the Closing Date pursuant to the first sentence of this
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_, Seller shall submit such Tax Returns to Buyer prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Returns (determined by taking into account
all applicable extensions) for review by Buyer. Buyer shall file or cause to
be timely filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained) all other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by, with respect
to, or that include a Taxpayer. With respect to Tax Returns to be filed by
Buyer pursuant to the preceding sentence for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or Straddle Period (I) such Tax Returns shall be filed in a manner consistent
with past practice and no position shall be taken, election made or method
adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods
used in prior periods in filing such Tax Returns (including any such
position, election or method which would have the effect of accelerating
income to periods for which Seller is liable or deferring deductions to
periods for which Buyer is liable), in each case, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, (II) all such Income Tax Returns shall be
submitted to Seller not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Returns (determined by taking into account all
applicable extensions) or, if such due date is within forty-five (45) days
following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing
Date, for review and comment by Seller, (III) to the extent practicable, all
such non-Income Tax Returns shall be submitted to Seller prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Returns (taking into account all applicable
extensions) for review and comment by Seller and (IV) in the case of clauses
(II) and (III), Buyer shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are
reasonably requested in writing by Seller within a reasonable period of time
prior

 



37  to the due date (excluding any applicable extensions) for filing such Tax
Returns. Except to the extent such Taxes are taken into account in the
computation of the Closing Date Working Capital or are otherwise Excluded
Taxes, Seller shall pay the Taxes for which Seller is liable pursuant to
_Section 8.1(a)_ but which are payable with any Tax Return to be filed by
Buyer pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_, upon the written request of Buyer,
setting forth in detail the computation of the amount owed by Seller, but in
no event earlier than ten (10) business days prior to the due date for paying
such Taxes, without regard to the aggregate indemnification limitations set
forth in _Section 11.2_.

(ii) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, none of Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause or permit a Taxpayer to) amend,
refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any statute of limitation
with respect to) any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to any Taxpayer
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent
of Seller. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, agreed to by Seller
or permitted under this Agreement, none of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer
shall (or shall cause or permit a Taxpayer to) amend, refile or otherwise
modify (or grant an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to)
any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to any Taxpayer with respect to
any Straddle Period, in each case if taking such action would reasonably be
expected to result in an increase in the taxable income or Taxes of a Taxpayer
for such Straddle Period for which Seller is liable under _Section 8.1(a)_.

 

(iii) Buyer shall cause the Taxpayers to prepare and provide to Seller a
package of Tax information materials, including schedules and work papers
(the " _Tax Package_ "), required by Seller to enable Seller to prepare and
file all Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed by it pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_. The Tax Package shall be completed in accordance with
past practice, including past practice as to providing such information and as
to the method of computation of separate taxable income or other relevant
measure of income of the Company and WHI-IPA. Buyer shall cause the Tax
Package to be delivered to Seller within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date or as soon as practicable thereafter.

(c)  _Tax Contest Provisions_.

(i) Buyer shall, within twenty (20) business days, notify Seller in writing
upon receipt by Buyer, any of its Affiliates, the Company or WHI-IPA of
notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax
audits, examinations or assessments relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods or
which might otherwise affect the Tax liabilities for which Seller may be
liable pursuant to this _Section 8.1_ (" _Tax Contest Claims_ "). The failure
of Buyer to give timely notice hereunder shall not affect Buyers right to
indemnification hereunder, except to the extent such delay or failure
prejudices Seller or any of its Affiliates.

(ii) Seller shall control (at its expense) any Tax Contest Claim with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that involves any Tax Group and Buyer shall not
participate in or control any such Tax Contest Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller shall not compromise or settle any such Tax Contest Claim without
obtaining Buyers prior written consent (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the extent such compromise or claim would
reasonably be expected to (A) in the case of a Tax Contest Claim relating to
liability for Federal Income Taxes, have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer or
a

 



38  Taxpayer in a Post-Closing Tax Period or (B) in the case of a Tax Contest
Claim not relating to liability for Federal Income Taxes, materially increase
the Taxes payable by Buyer or a Taxpayer in a Post-Closing Tax Period (in the
case of any other Taxes described in this clause (ii)).

(iii) With respect to a Tax Contest Claim with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period not described in _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, Seller shall have the right to
control the conduct of such Tax Contest Claim unless Seller fails to provide
Buyer with notice of its election to control such Tax Contest Claim within
thirty (30) days of Buyer notifying Seller of such Tax Contest Claim in
accordance with _Section 8.1(c)(i)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) Seller
shall keep Buyer informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of
such Tax Contest Claim and (B) if the resolution of such Tax Contest Claim
would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Buyer, the Company
or WHI-IPA for a period that begins after the Closing Date then Buyer shall
be entitled to participate (at its expense) in any such Tax Contest Claim and
Seller shall not compromise or settle any such Tax Contest Claim without
obtaining Buyers prior written consent (which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If Seller does not elect to
control a Tax Contest Claim pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ within the
time period set forth above, then Buyer shall be entitled to control such Tax
Contest Claim, provided that Buyer shall not (A) extend the statute of
limitations with respect to such Tax Contest Claim or (B) settle or compromise
such Tax Contest Claim, in each case without obtaining Sellers prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(iv) In the case of a Tax Contest Claim for a Straddle Period, Buyer shall
control such Tax Contest Claim, provided that (A) Buyer shall keep Seller
informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Contest
Claim, (B) Seller shall be entitled to participate (at its expense) in any
such Tax Contest Claim, and (C) none of Buyer, any of its Affiliates, the
Company or WHI-IPA may settle or compromise any such Tax Contest Claim for any
Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant to  _Section 8.1(a)_, without
the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

(v) In determining whether consent is unreasonably withheld or conditioned
with respect to any proposed settlement by any party under this _Section
8.1(c)_, the facts and circumstances, including, without limitation, the
relative amount of Taxes at issue in the Pre-Closing Tax Period, the portion
of the Straddle Period that ends prior to the Closing Date, the Post-Closing
Tax Period and the portion of the Straddle Period that ends after the Closing

Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date and (iii) to the extent an
indemnification payment has been or is expected to be made by Seller
hereunder, any other Taxes indemnified by Seller pursuant to _Section

Company and WHI-IPA to continue to employ all Business Employees; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, solely for purposes of _Section 8.2_ of this Agreement,
any employees of the Company or WHI-IPA who are on short-term or long-term
disability immediately prior to the Closing Date (" _Employees on Leave_ ")
shall not be deemed to be Business Employees until such employees return to
active employment, provided that each such employee returns to active
employment within one (1) year following the Closing Date. Until and unless
such Employees on Leave become Business Employees, Seller shall retain, and
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall

 



41  assume, any liabilities related to the employment of the Employees on Leave.
For a period of at least one (1) year following the Closing Date, each
Business Employee shall be entitled to receive while in the employment of
Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company and WHI-IPA) at least the same

commencing on the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2011, each Business
Employee shall be eligible to receive while in the employment of Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Company and WHI-IPA) a cash-based target annual
incentive bonus opportunity that is substantially comparable in the aggregate
to that provided to such employee by the Company or WHI-IPA immediately prior
to the Closing Date, and as set forth on _Schedule 5.18_; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that in no event shall Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including
the Company and WHI-IPA) be required to take into account any specific
performance goals under bonus plans when determining whether such bonus
opportunity is substantially comparable. Notwithstanding any provision herein
to the contrary, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including the
Company and WHI-IPA) shall be obligated to continue to employ any Business
Employee for any specific period of time following the Closing Date.

(b) _Buyer Benefit Plans_. For a period of at least one (1) year following
the Closing Date, the Business Employees shall receive employee benefits
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, retirement, welfare and fringe

provided by Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) to its similarly situated
employees.

 

(c) _Company Plans_.

(i) Except as set forth in _Schedule 8.2(c)_ , (collectively, the " _Assumed

Company Plans, and Seller shall retain any and all obligations and liabilities
related to the Company Plans, including, without limitation, any retention

the Company, or any of their Affiliates or Company Plans obligations to make
payments or provide benefits accrued under any Company Plan.

(ii) Effective as of the Closing Date, except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement, all Business Employees will cease any active
participation in, and any benefit accrual under, all Company Plans.

(iii) Buyer either currently maintains, or will establish or cause the Company

rollovers (in the form of cash and notes relating to plan participant loans)
of "eligible rollover distributions" as defined in the Code and applicable
Requirements of Law that Business Employees are eligible to receive from
Sellers defined contribution plans (" _Seller s DC Plans_") without
adversely affecting the qualified status

 



42  of Sellers DC Plans or Buyers DC Plans. Buyers DC Plans will contain
provisions to permit any such direct rollover to include the promissory note
or notes representing any plan loans outstanding to the Business Employee
under Sellers DC Plans on the date of the direct rollover, and Buyer, the
Company and Seller will cooperate with each other to enable such direct
rollovers to occur, to the extent possible, before such loans become
defaulted. Seller shall cause the applicable Sellers DC Plans to fully vest
Business Employees in their accounts immediately prior to the Closing and
permit the Business Employees to elect a lump sum cash distribution
of benefits accrued through the Closing Date in accordance with the Code. In
addition, Seller shall cause the applicable Sellers DC Plans to fully vest
the Employees on Leave, immediately prior to the time when such Employees on
Leave become Business Employees and permit the Employees on Leave to elect a
lump sum cash distribution of benefits accrued through the date such Employees
on Leave become Business Employees in accordance with the Code.

 

(d) _Severance Benefits_. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the
contrary, following the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to, or to cause its
Affiliates to, provide severance benefits to any Business Employee whose
employment is terminated during the one (1) year period beginning on the
Closing Date in an amount that is at least equal to the severance benefits
that would have been paid to such employee pursuant to the terms of the
Company Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, to be
calculated, however, on the basis of the employees compensation and service
at the time of the termination. 

(e) _Credit for Service_. To the extent that service is relevant for purposes
of eligibility and vesting (and, in order to calculate the amount of any
vacation, sick days, short-term disability, salary continuation, severance and
similar benefits, but not for purposes of defined benefit pension benefit
accruals) under any retirement plan, employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates for
the benefit of the Business Employees, following the Closing Date such plan,
program or arrangement shall credit such Business Employees for service earned
on and prior to the Closing Date with the Company or WHI-IPA or any of their
predecessors in addition to service earned with Buyer or any of Buyers
Affiliates after the Closing Date, except in all cases where doing so would
result in a duplication of benefits.

(f) _Preexisting Conditions_. Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, waive any waiting period provision or any
preexisting conditions exclusions of the Business Employees and their eligible
dependents to the extent such provisions or conditions would have been waived
or satisfied under the analogous Company Plan. Following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall recognize, or shall cause its Affiliates to also recognize, for
purposes of annual deductible and out of pocket limits under its health and
dental plans, deductible and out of pocket expenses paid by Business

Business Employees participate in any such health and dental plans in such
same calendar year.

Seller shall not transfer to Buyer, any liabilities of Seller with respect to
accrued but unused vacation (including all banked vacation for calendar year

to such Business Employee. Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to accommodate
each Business Employee with scheduled or planned vacation to occur in
calendar year 2011 after the Closing Date in accordance with Buyers normal
vacation approval policies applicable to its similarly situated employees.

 

(h) _Healthcare Spending Account Program_. Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, establish or maintain a Healthcare Spending Account program
for each Business Employee who, in the portion of the calendar year on or
prior to the Closing Date, contributed to the Healthcare Spending Account
program of Seller. The beginning balance as of the Closing Date in Buyers
Healthcare Spending Account program shall be the unused portion of the balance
in Sellers Healthcare Spending Account program. To the extent that Buyer (or
an Affiliate of Buyer) has previously established and maintains a
Health Reimbursement Account, any unused amount in Sellers Health
Reimbursement Account (on behalf of the Business Employees) shall be credited
to Buyers Health Reimbursement Account to the extent that it is greater than
the amount a similarly situated employee of Buyer may be entitled.

(i) _Dependent Care Spending Account Program_. Buyer shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, establish or maintain a Dependent Care Spending
Account program for each Business Employee who, in the portion of the calendar
year on or prior to the Closing Date, contributed to the Dependent Care

Affiliate to, provide continuation health care coverage to all Business
Employees and their qualified beneficiaries, regardless of when a "qualifying

agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 8.2_ with respect to
employees are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties and

Business Employees relating to the Buyers plans, intentions or obligations
with respect to the Business Employees.

Section 8.3 _Securities Law Legends_. Buyer agrees and understands that

46 (c) For a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date, Seller

construed to prohibit or restrict (A) any investment by Seller or any of its
controlled Affiliates in any class of publicly-traded debt or equity
securities of any company engaged in a Competitive Business so long as Seller,
in the aggregate together with its controlled Affiliates, does not hold at any
time during such period more than five percent (5%) of such class of issued
and outstanding voting securities of such publicly-traded company, or five
percent (5%) of the aggregate principal amount of such class of debt

organizations, third-party administrators, labor unions and individuals, (D)
Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates from engaging in any action
contemplated by this Agreement or any other agreement between Seller and its
controlled Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its controlled
Affiliates, on the other hand, including any Seller Ancillary Agreement or (E)
Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates from acquiring any Person or
business (whether by means of a merger, the acquisition of equity, assets, a
combination thereof or other transaction) engaged in a Competitive Business if
(1) the revenue of such Person or business for the immediately preceding
twelve (12) month period derived from the Competitive Business was less than
ten percent (10%) of the total revenues of such Person or business during such
period and the ownership and operation of such Person or business thereafter

Affiliated entity of Seller promptly (and in any event within one (1) year)
after the acquisition thereof; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that,
notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 8.5_ shall not be binding on any
Person that may acquire Seller by way of merger, stock
acquisition, reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of its assets
or other business combination.

(d) As used in this Agreement, " _Competitive Business_ " means a business
primarily engaged in the provision of pharmacy benefit management services
including pharmacy benefit plan designs, pharmacy benefit clinical programs,

education relating to the management of prescription pharmacy benefits.

(e) Except as required by applicable Requirements of Law and except for
information which is now or hereafter becomes public other than as a result of
a breach of this _Section 8.5(e)_, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, until the third anniversary of

 



47  the Closing Date, disclose to any other Person or otherwise use any
confidential or proprietary information of the Company or WHI-IPA acquired by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, whether in written, oral or other form;
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 8.5(e)_ shall in any way limit the
disclosure of any such information to the representatives of Seller or any of
its Affiliates in order to assist Seller with respect to the transactions and
the other documents referred to herein.

(f) In the event that the terms of this  _Section 8.5_ shall be determined
by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its
extending for too great a period of time or over too great a geographical area
or by reason of its being too extensive in any other respect, it will be
interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time for which it may be
enforceable, and/or over the maximum geographical area as to which it may be
enforceable and/or to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which it
may be enforceable, all as determined by such court in such action.

(g) It is recognized and acknowledged by Seller that (i) the Purchase Price
is adequate consideration for the covenants contained in this _Section 8.5_
and (ii) a breach of the covenants contained in this _Section 8.5_ will cause
irreparable damage to Buyer, the exact amount of which will be difficult or
impossible to ascertain, and that the remedies at law for any such breach will
be inadequate. Accordingly, Seller agrees that, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of a breach of any
of the covenants contained in this _Section 8.5_, in addition to any other
remedy which may be available at law or in equity, Buyer will be entitled to
specific performance and injunctive relief.

 

Section 8.6 _Use of Names_.

(a) Seller is not conveying ownership rights or granting Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Company and WHI-IPA after the Closing) a license to
use any of the trade names, service marks or trademarks of Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller (other than the trademarks and service marks included, or
should have been included, in the Intellectual Property identified in
_Schedule 5.11(a)_ ) (collectively, the " _Retained Names and Marks_ ") and,
after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company and WHI-IPA
after the Closing) shall not use in any manner the names or marks of Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller or any word that is similar in sound or appearance to
such names or marks, except as provided in this _Section 8.6_. In the event
Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (including the Company and WHI-IPA after the
Closing) violates any of its obligations under this  _Section 8.6_, Seller
and its Affiliates may proceed against it in law or in equity for such damages
or other relief as a court may deem appropriate. Buyer acknowledges that a
violation of this _Section 8.6_ may cause Seller and its Affiliates
irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated for by money damages.
Buyer therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or threatened violation
of this _Section 8.6_, Seller and its Affiliates shall be entitled, in
addition to other remedies that they may have, to seek a temporary restraining
order and to seek preliminary and final injunctive relief against Buyer or
such Affiliate of Buyer to prevent any violations of this _Section
8.6_, without the necessity of posting a bond.

(b) Except as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement, except for any
use of the Retained Names and Marks on any member identification card until
renewal of the

 



48  applicable agreement or identification card or replacement of any member
identification card, and except as the parties may otherwise agree in writing,
as soon as commercially practicable, but in any event within ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (and shall cause the Company and WHI-IPA
to) cease using (i) any advertising or promotional materials and (ii) any
stationery, business cards, business forms and other similar items, in each
case that contain anywhere thereon any of the Retained Names and Marks;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
(and shall cause the Company and WHI-IPA to use commercially reasonable
efforts), when using items identified or referred to in _Section 8.6(b)(ii)_
in the context of entering into or conducting contractual relationships, make
reasonably clear to all other applicable parties that Buyer, the Company and
WHI-IPA, rather than Seller or any Affiliate of Seller is the party entering
into or conducting the contractual relationship; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts (and shall cause the Company
and WHI-IPA to use commercially reasonable efforts) to ensure that personnel
of the Company and WHI-IPA using such items shall not, and shall have no
authority to, hold themselves out as officers, employees or agents of Seller
or any Affiliate of Seller. All uses of the Retained Names and Marks by the
Company and WHI-IPA shall be limited to such uses as were made immediately
prior to the Closing and all goodwill associated with such uses shall inure to
the benefit of Seller and its Affiliates, as applicable. The Company and WHI-
IPA shall notify Seller promptly of any infringement or dilution of any of the
Retained Names and Marks of which it becomes aware Within ten (10) Business
Days after the Closing, Buyer shall amend the Articles of Incorporation of
the Company and the Certificate of Incorporation of WHI-IPA to rename the
Company and WHI-IPA, respectively, to names that do not include any of the
Retained Names and Marks.

 

Section 8.7 _Wrong Pocket Assets_.

(a) After the Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to hold
in trust for the benefit of Seller any assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries which prior to Closing related exclusively or primarily to the
business of Seller (other than the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Company or its Subsidiaries to transfer such assets as soon as reasonably
practicable to Seller without consideration. The costs and expenses of such
transfer shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. If any such assets were
from time to time used in connection with the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, at the request of Buyer, Seller shall, or cause its Affiliates
to, grant Buyer or the Company and its Subsidiaries a non-exclusive royalty-
free irrevocable license to use such assets for any purpose whatsoever (other
than any purpose that would otherwise violate Sellers obligations pursuant
to _Section 8.5(c)_) which shall be deemed to be effective from Closing.

(b) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to hold in trust for the
benefit of Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries any assets of Seller which
prior to Closing related exclusively or primarily to the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
transfer such assets as soon as reasonably practicable to Buyer or the Company
and its Subsidiaries without consideration. The costs and expenses of such
transfer shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. If any such assets were
from time to time used in connection with the business of Seller (other than
the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries), at the request of Seller,
Buyer shall cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to grant Seller a non-
exclusive royalty-free irrevocable license to use such assets for any purpose
whatsoever which shall be deemed to be effective from Closing.

 



49 Section 8.8 _Waiver of Conflicts; Confidentiality and Privilege_. Buyer
(on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby irrevocably acknowledges and
agrees that: (a) Seller and its Affiliates shall each have the right to retain
the Designated Firms to represent their respective interests in any dispute or
disagreement arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) Buyer (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates) irrevocably waives, consents to and covenants not to assert any
objection, based on conflict of interest or otherwise, to any representation
of Seller or any of its Affiliates by any of the Designated Firms prior to or
after the Closing in any dispute or disagreement by any Buyer Group Member
against Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, (c) all communications between any of
Seller, the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, managers, members,
officers or employees, on the one hand, and the Designated Firms, on the
other hand, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and closing under, or any dispute or disagreement arising under or in
connection with, this Agreement or relating to any potential sale of the
Company (the " _Protected Seller Communications_ "), shall be deemed to be
privileged and confidential communications, (d) all rights to such Protected
Seller Communications, and the control of the confidentiality and
privilege applicable thereto, shall be retained by Seller, and (e) to the
extent Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company and WHI-IPA) should discover in its possession after the Closing any
Protected Seller Communications, it shall take reasonable steps to preserve
the confidentiality thereof and promptly deliver the same to Seller, keeping
no copies, and shall not by reason thereof assert any loss of confidentiality
or privilege protection. Seller (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates)
hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that: (x) all communications
between any of Buyer, any of its respective Affiliates, directors,
stockholders, officers or employees, on the one hand, and Buyers internal
and external legal counsel, on the other hand, made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any
dispute or disagreement arising under or in connection with, this Agreement
or relating to any potential purchase of the Company (the " _Protected Buyer
Communications_ "), shall be deemed to be privileged and confidential
communications and (y) all rights to such Protected Buyer Communications, and
the control of the confidentiality and privilege applicable thereto, shall be
retained by Buyer.

Person claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnitor, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Indemnified
Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices, complaints and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnitor relating to the third
Person claim. The failure to give notice as provided in this _Section
11.6_ shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to

such failure.

(b) If any legal proceeding shall be threatened or instituted or any claim or
demand shall be asserted by any Person in respect of which payment may be
sought by one party hereto from the other party under the provisions of this

has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the
Indemnitor. Any notice of a claim by reason of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement shall refer to the
provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument
executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is
based and describe in reasonable detail, the facts giving rise to an alleged
basis for the claim and the amount of the liability (if then known) asserted
against the Indemnitor by reason of the claim. In the event of the initiation
of any legal proceeding against the Indemnified Party by a third Person, the
Indemnitor shall have the sole and absolute right after the receipt of notice,
at its option and at its own expense, to be represented by counsel of its
choice and to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with any proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any loss, liability or
damage indemnified against hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party may participate in any such proceeding with counsel of its
choice and at its expense. Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate
fully with the other party in connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any such legal proceeding, claim or demand and to
make available to the other party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials
and information in such partys possession or under such partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the other party. To the extent
the Indemnitor elects not to defend such proceeding, claim or demand, and the
Indemnified Party defends against or otherwise deals with any such proceeding,
claim or demand, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel, at the expense of
the Indemnitor, and control the defense of such proceeding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnitor shall be obligated pursuant to this _Section
11.6_ to pay for only one firm of counsel in each applicable jurisdiction for
all Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnitor does not, within twenty (20) days
of receipt of notice of a proceeding, claim or demand, give notice to the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such proceeding,
claim or demand and thereafter promptly assume the defense of such
proceeding, claim or demand, then the Indemnified Party will (upon delivering
written notice to such effect to the Indemnitor) have the right to undertake
the defense, compromise or settlement of such proceeding, claim or demand and
the Indemnitor shall have the right to participate therein at its own cost and
the Indemnitor will be bound by any judicial determination made with respect
to such claim or any compromise or settlement of the claim effected by the
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Indemnitor nor
the Indemnified Party may settle any such proceeding, claim or demand which
settlement obligates the other party to pay money, to perform obligations or
to admit liability without the consent of the other party, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, unless such settlement (i) does not involve any
finding or admission of any violation of applicable Requirements of Law or any
violation of the rights of any Person, (ii) does not involve any relief other
than monetary damages and (iii) includes, as an unconditional term thereof,
the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff of a full and unconditional
release of the Indemnified Parties from all liability with respect to the
matters that are subject to such proceeding. After any final judgment or award
shall have been rendered by a court, arbitration board or administrative
agency of competent jurisdiction and the time in which to appeal therefrom
has expired, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnitor shall arrive at a mutually binding agreement with
respect to each separate matter alleged to be indemnified by the Indemnitor
hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the Indemnitor notice of
any sums due and owing by it with respect to such matter and the Indemnitor

certified or bank cashiers check within five (5) Business Days after the

_Section 8.1(c)_ (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of _Section
8.1(c)_ shall control with respect to Tax contests.

Section 11.7 _Limitations_.

(a) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any
amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnitor has
indemnified it pursuant to this _Article XI_ , such Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such
recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid
by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such
matter and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnitor in pursuing or defending
any claim arising out of such matter.

(b) If Seller is conducting any defense against a third Person claim for which
a Buyer Group Member has sought indemnification pursuant to _Section
11.2(a)_, expenses incurred by Seller in connection therewith, including
legal costs and expenses, shall constitute Losses for purposes of determining
the maximum aggregate amount to be paid by Seller pursuant to _Section
11.2(a)_.

 

(c) In no event shall any party be liable for any special, incidental,
consequential (including loss of revenues or profits), exemplary or punitive
damages or diminution of value or any damages based on any type of multiple,
whether arising under any legal or equitable theory or arising under or in
connection with this Agreement, all of which are hereby excluded by agreement
of the parties regardless of whether or not any party to this Agreement has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

(d) Seller shall not be required to indemnify and hold harmless any Buyer
Group Member pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_ to the extent the matter in
question was taken into account in the computation of, or otherwise resulted
in, the Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section 4.5_, any of the amounts
calculated pursuant to _Section 4.7_. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Purchase Price is
reduced pursuant to  _Section 4.8_, such adjustment shall be Buyers sole
and exclusive remedy for breaches of or inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties set forth in _Section 5.5_ relating to the Financial
Statements with respect to differences between the individual line items set
forth in the Financial Statements and the Audited Financial Statements.

(e) Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law and
injunctive and provisional relief (including specific performance), if the
Closing occurs, this _Article XI_ and _Section 8.1_ shall be the exclusive
remedy for breaches of this Agreement (including any covenant, obligation,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement) or otherwise in respect of the sale of
the Shares contemplated hereby other than actions for fraud; _provided_ ,
that nothing contained in this Agreement shall in any manner limit either
partys right to seek specific performance, injunctive

 



56  relief and other equitable relief to enforce any of the other partys post-
Closing obligations under this Agreement. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of Seller
or Buyer, after the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Shares
contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) All amounts paid as an indemnity by one party to the other under
this Agreement will be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all
Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Requirements of Law.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any knowledge of Buyer
with respect to any breach by Seller of any of Sellers representations,
warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement prior to Closing shall
have no effect on the right of Buyer to indemnification, and the obligation of
Seller to indemnify Buyer, for any Losses with respect to such breach.

 

Section 11.8 _Mitigation_. Each of the parties agrees to take all reasonable
steps to mitigate their respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of
any event or condition which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

ARTICLE XII

Section 12.1 _Termination_. Anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing Date:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

 

(b) by Buyer if (i) there is any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this Agreement, such
that the conditions specified in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.2_ would not be
satisfied (a " _Terminating Seller Breach_ "), except that, if such
Terminating Seller Breach is curable by Seller through the exercise of
commercially reasonable efforts, then, for a period of up to twenty (20) days
after receipt by Seller of notice from Buyer of such breach, but only as long
as Seller continues to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
Terminating Seller Breach (the " _Seller Cure Period_ "), such termination
shall not be effective until, and such termination shall become effective only
if, the Terminating Seller Breach is not cured within the Seller Cure Period;

(c) by Seller if (i) there is any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this Agreement, such
that the conditions specified in _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_ would not
be satisfied (a " _Terminating Buyer Breach_ "), except that, if any such
Terminating Buyer Breach is curable by Buyer through the exercise of its
commercially reasonable efforts, then, for a period of up to thirty (30) days
after receipt by Buyer of notice from Seller of such breach, but only as long

herein shall relieve any party from liability for its willful breach of this
Agreement. Subject to the foregoing sentence, each partys right of
termination under this _Article XII_ is in addition to any other rights it may
have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of
termination will not be an election of remedies. _Sections 12.3_ , _13.2_ ,
_13.3_ , _13.4_ , _13.11_ , _13.16_ and _13.17_ shall survive the termination
of this Agreement.

not performed in accordance with their specific wording or were otherwise

entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent such breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States of America or any state having jurisdiction, such

(a) For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, Seller and its

such disposition, give Seller a reasonable opportunity, at Sellers expense,
to segregate and remove such books and records as Seller may select;

document retention program.

(b) For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, Buyer and its

dispose of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of such three
(3) year period, Seller shall, prior to such disposition, give Buyer a
reasonable opportunity, at Buyers expense, to segregate and remove such
books and records as Buyer may select; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
shall not be required to provide Buyer with such opportunity to the extent
that such books and records are to be disposed of in the ordinary
course pursuant to Sellers customary document retention program.

Section 13.8 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, the Exhibits and
Schedules referred to herein, the documents delivered pursuant hereto and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire understanding of the parties
hereto with regard to the subject matter contained herein or therein, and
supersede all other prior representations, warranties, agreements (whether
written or oral), understandings or letters of intent related to the
transactions contemplated hereby between or among any of the parties hereto.
This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except by a
written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each of the
parties hereto. At the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect.

Section 13.9 _Interpretation_. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule
hereto referenced by a particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been disclosed with respect to every other section in this Agreement to
the extent it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that it
could apply to such other section. Neither the specification of any dollar
amount in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply
that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or
other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the
setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically
provides otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such item
or

 



61  matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the Ordinary Course of
Business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the
inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in any Schedule is or is not in the Ordinary Course of Business
for purposes of this Agreement.

 

Section 13.10 _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived
in writing, or the time for its performance may be extended in writing, by
the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be
validly and sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as
to any party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of
such party. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any
provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such
provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or
any part hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and
every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held
to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

 

Section 13.11 _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth herein, each party
hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident to its negotiation and
preparation of this Agreement and to its performance and compliance with all
agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or
complied with (whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be consummated), including the fees, expenses and disbursements of its
counsel, independent public accountants and other advisors.

Section 13.12 _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained
herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to
the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would
be unreasonable. The parties agree that if any provision contained herein is,
to any extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the laws
governing this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the
remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or
otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that
is held invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving
effect to the intent of the parties.

Section 13.13 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument, but
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to the other party.

Section 13.14 _Further Assurances_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions herein, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all action, to do or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Requirements of Law to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions

 



62  contemplated by this Agreement, including: (a) the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the parties hereto; and (b)
the execution and delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other
actions, as the other party hereto may reasonably require in order to carry
out the intent of this Agreement. In the event that at any time after the
Closing any further action is necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Requirements of Law to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including to vest title to the Shares in
Buyer, Seller will take such further action (including the execution
and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as Buyer reasonably
may request, all at the sole cost and expense of Buyer.

 

Section 13.15 _Disclaimer of Warranties_. Except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement, any Buyer Ancillary Agreement or Seller Ancillary Agreement
or the Exhibits, no representations, warranties (whether express or implied),
covenants, understandings or agreements (oral or otherwise), relating to the
Shares (and the business, assets and liabilities of the Company and the
Subsidiaries) exist between the parties. SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO
IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.

 

Section 13.16 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws (as
opposed to the conflicts of law provisions) of the State of Delaware. By the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of Buyer and Seller (a) submits
to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the State of
Delaware in any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to defeat or deny such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than a federal or
state court sitting in the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that it will not bring or
support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, without limitation, any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than
a court of competent jurisdiction located within the City of New York, New
York, whether a state or Federal court, and that the provisions of _Section
13.17_ relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim.

Section 13.17 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of Buyer and Seller hereby
expressly waives any right to trial by jury in any action, whether sounding in
contract, tort or otherwise, brought by Buyer or Seller arising out of or
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the
Seller Ancillary Agreements or Buyer Ancillary Agreements, or any other
instrument or document executed or delivered in connection herewith or
therewith. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that this
Agreement constitutes a written consent to waiver of trial by jury pursuant
to any applicable state statutes. Either Buyer or Seller may file an original
counterpart or a copy of this Agreement with any court as written evidence of
the consent of the parties to the waiver of their right to trial by jury.
