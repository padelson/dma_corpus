has approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and deems it advisable and in
the best interests of their respective stockholders to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to which, among other things, and as a single integrated

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (i)&nbsp;if the Second Step
Merger occurs, the Integrated Merger will qualify as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and that this Agreement will be,
and is hereby, adopted as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section&nbsp;1.368-2(g) and (ii)&nbsp;if the Second Step Merger does not occur, the First Step Merger will be
treated as a taxable transaction.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition
