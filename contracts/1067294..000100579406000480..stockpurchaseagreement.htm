one of its Affiliates to lease to the  Company any Excluded Property on the
same terms and conditions as the  Sale-Leaseback. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer is free to negotiate an  alternative sale/leaseback
transaction (such transaction, an " _Alternative  Sale/Leaseback_ "),  so 
long as (i) the terms and conditions of such transaction are at least as 
favorable or more favorable to Seller and (ii) the Alternative
Sale/Leaseback  does not create a delay in the Closing. Upon Buyer's request
and upon payment by  Buyer, if and when required, of the Termination Fee and
associated costs  required to be paid under the Sale-Leaseback Documents,
Seller shall cause  the  Company to terminate the Sale-Leaseback and execute
documents setting forth  the  Alternative Sale/Leaseback (the "Alternative

the Company to use reasonable best efforts  to satisfy the conditions to
receipt of proceeds under the Alternative  Sale/Leaseback.

9.5 _Satisfaction  of Conditions Precedent_.   Seller and Buyer will each
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause  the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent contained in this Agreement;  provided, however, that

prepare and file  the  notifications required by the HSR Act. Buyer shall

make, issue or release any public or industry  announcement, statement or,

except for such statements or releases which may be required  by  Law.

 

 

9.8 _Exclusivity_.   Seller agrees that, until such time as this Agreement
is terminated  pursuant to _Section  12_ ,  it  shall not and it shall

40  

 

 

 

representatives,  officers, directors, agents or Affiliates not to initiate,
solicit, entertain,  negotiate, accept or discuss, directly or indirectly,
any Acquisition Proposal  or provide any non-public information to any third
party in connection with  an  Acquisition Proposal or enter into any

immediately notify Buyer if the Company, Seller or any  of  their respective
representatives, directors, officers or agents receive any  Acquisition
Proposal, and will communicate to Buyer in reasonable detail  the  terms and
conditions of any Acquisition Proposal as well as the identity  of the

prior written consent of Buyer. Prior to the  consummation of the Sale-
Leaseback, Seller shall provide to Buyer, and Buyer  shall have the right to
review and approve or disapprove of, any and all  agreements with respect to
the Sale-Leaseback and any amendments or  modifications of any Sale-Leaseback
Documents or Alternative Sale/Leaseback  Documents which create a direct or
indirect obligation of, or could result  in  any direct or indirect
liability to, the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Buyer shall have
the right to review and approve the Sale-Leaseback Documents  or 
Alternative Sale/Leaseback Documents and such other agreements so as to
confirm  operating lease accounting treatment under GAAP for the tenant
thereunder (it  being understood and acknowledged that the form of Sale-
Leaseback Documents  referred to in the Disclosure Schedule and any
Alternative Sale/Leaseback  Documents requested by Buyer are deemed approved
by Buyer). Upon consummation  of  the Sale-Leaseback in accordance with this
Agreement and the agreements approved  by Buyer, each Owned Real Property
noted on the schedule as subject to the  Sale-Leaseback shall become and be
deemed a Leased Real Property for all  purposes, whereupon all
representations, warranties and covenants herein set  forth shall thereafter
apply with respect to such newly-classified Leased Real  Property with the
same force and effect as if such Real Property was originally  classified as
same.

10.3 _Claim  Threshold_.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Buyer shall be liable  to Seller Indemnitees and Seller
shall be liable to Buyer Indemnitees with  respect to a Claim for
indemnification  for  breaches of representations and warranties (other than
with respect to  Fundamental Representations)  under  this Agreement (x)
only at such time as, and to the extent that, **** the  aggregate of all
amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder exceeds $1,000,000  (the " _Basket_
"),  and  then only for the amount by which such aggregate damages exceed
$1,000,000  and  (y) only if and to the extent that such $1,000,000 consists
of one or more  Claims, each such Claim or series of related Claims of which
is in excess of  $100,000 (the " _Mini-Basket_.");  provided, however, that
the Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees and  the  Seller shall
indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for the full amount of any Claim  that
exceeds the Mini Basket, subject only to clause (x) of this Section 10.3  and
subject further to Section 10.4.

herein **,**   with  respect to claims for breaches of representations and
warranties (other than  with respect to Fundamental Representations) ****
the  maximum indemnification liability of Seller to Buyer party shall not
exceed  an  amount equal to $31.1 million (the " _Cap_ ").

 

 

10.5 _Exclusion  of Consequential and Punitive Damages_.   No party to this
Agreement shall have indemnification liability for  consequential or punitive
damages.

 

 

10.6 _Reimbursement  of Certain Indemnified Claims_.   Any amount received
pursuant to Seller's or Buyer's respective  indemnification obligations under
this Agreement will be net of (a) the proceeds  of any insurance coverage 
actually  recovered by Buyer or the Company  duplicating the amount
previously indemnified or for which indemnification  is  sought or (b) the
indemnitee's income taxes were reduced by reason of any  deduction allowed to
indemnitee for any payment, settlement or satisfaction,  in  each case, with
respect to the events giving rise to the indemnification  payment.

 

 

10.7 _Claims  for Indemnification_.   Whenever any Claim shall arise for
indemnification hereunder, the indemnified  party shall promptly notify the
indemnifying party in writing of the claim  and,  when known, the facts
constituting the basis for such claim, provided however,  that no delay on
the part of the indemnified party shall release the  indemnifying party of
any liability or obligation hereunder unless (and then  solely to the extent)
the indemnifying party thereby is  actually  damaged.  In the event of any
such Claim for indemnification hereunder resulting from  or  in connection
with any Claim or legal proceedings by a third-party, the notice  to the
indemnifying party shall specify, if known, the amount or an estimate  of 
the amount of the liability arising therefrom. The indemnified party shall 
not  settle or compromise any Claim by a third party for which he or it is
entitled  to indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of
the  indemnifying party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless
suit shall  have been instituted against it and the indemnifying party shall
not have taken  control of such suit after notification thereof.

 

 

10.8 _Defense  of Indemnifying Party_.   In connection with any claim to
indemnity hereunder resulting from or arising  out of any claim or legal
proceeding by a Person who is not a party to this  Agreement, the
indemnifying party, at its sole cost and expense may, upon  written notice to
the indemnified party, assume the defense of any such claim  or  legal
proceeding if it

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

acknowledges  to the indemnified party in writing its obligations to
indemnify the indemnified  party with respect to all elements of such claim.
In any such claim or  proceeding, the indemnifying party will not consent to
the entry of any judgment  with respect to the matter, or enter into any
settlement, which does not  include  a provision whereby the plaintiff or
claimant in the matter releases the  indemnified party from all liability
with respect thereto. The indemnified  party  shall be entitled to
participate in (but not control) the defense of any  such  action, with its
counsel and at its own expense. If the indemnifying party  does  not assume
the defense of any such claim or litigation resulting therefrom  within
fifteen (15) days after receiving written notice that such claim is  made, 
(a) the indemnified party may defend against such claim or litigation, in 
such  manner as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to,
settling  such  claim or litigation, after giving notice of the same to the
indemnifying  party,  on such terms as the indemnified party may deem
appropriate, and (b) the  indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate
in (but not control)  the  defense of such action, with its counsel and at
its own expense. If the  indemnifying party thereafter seeks to question the
manner in which the  indemnified party defended such third party claim or the
amount or nature  of any  such settlement, the indemnifying party shall have
the burden to prove by  a  preponderance of the evidence that the
indemnified party did not defend or  settle such third party claim in a
reasonably prudent manner.

 

 

 

10.9 _Exclusive  Remedy_.   Except as provided in _Section  11_ ,  the 
indemnification rights provided in _Section  10_   shall be  the sole and
exclusive remedy available to the parties hereto for any and all  Losses
related to a breach of any of the terms, conditions, covenants,  agreements,
representations or warranties contained herein or in any of the  ancillary
documents hereto, or any right, claim or action arising from the 
transactions contemplated hereunder (and each party hereby waives and
releases,  to the fullest extent that it may do so, any other right or remedy
that may  arise under any Law **)**   with the  exception of claims based
on fraud or intentional misrepresentation (to which  none of the limitations
or requirements set forth in this _Article  10_   shall  apply) **;**  
provided  that the provisions of this _Section  10.9_   shall  not

11. TAX MATTERS.

 

 

11.1 _Tax   Indemnities._

 

 

 

       (a)  | From and after the Closing Date, Seller agrees to 
indemnify Buyer and Company against all Taxes (i) imposed on Seller  or any 
member of an affiliated group with which Seller files a consolidated  or 
combined income Tax Return with respect to any taxable period that  ends on 
or before the Closing Date, including any Taxes resulting from or 
attributable to Seller's sale of the Shares, or (ii) without  duplication
with respect to the Working Capital Adjustment, imposed  on  Company with
respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) that  ends  on or before
the Closing Date, or, without duplication,  (iii) any Taxes imposed on the
Company as a result of the  Sale-Leaseback, provided, however, that  no
indemnity shall be provided under this Agreement for any Taxes  resulting
from any transaction of Company occurring after the Closing  Date. Any
indemnity payment made by Seller pursuant to this  _Section 11.1_ shall, in
accordance with _Section 11.5(a)_ , be  treated for tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price and  shall not include or require any gross-
up for Taxes on such indemnity  payment.  
---|--- 
      |   
    (b)  | From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify  Seller
against all Taxes imposed on or with respect to Company and transactions for
or that occur  in periods that begin  after the Closing Date. Any indemnity
payment made by Buyer pursuant  to this _Section 11.1(b)._ shall, in
accordance  with _Section 11.5(a)_ , be treated for tax purposes as an
adjustment  to the Purchase Price and shall not include or require any gross-
up  for  Taxes on such indemnity payment.  
      |   
    (c)  | Any indemnity payment required under this _Section  11.1_
shall be made within ten (10) business days following notice  by  the party
to be indemnified that payment of the amount for which  indemnity  is sought
is then due to the appropriate Tax authority; provided,  however  that no
indemnity payment shall be required to be made more than  two (2)  business
days before it is due to the appropriate Tax authority. In  the case of a Tax
that is contested pursuant to _Section 11.3_ ,  payment of the Tax to the
appropriate Tax authority will not be considered  to be due until a final
non-appealable determination to such effect  is  made by the appropriate Tax
authority or a court.  
      |   
    (d)  | For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any  Tax  that
is imposed on a periodic basis and is payable for a period that  begins
before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, the  portion of such
Tax payable for the period ending on the Closing  Date  shall be (i) in the
case of any Tax other than a Tax based upon or  measured by income or wages,
the amount of such Tax for the entire  period  multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of  days in  the period ending on the
Closing Date and  
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

the  denominator of which is  the number of days in the entire period and
(ii) in the case of any Tax based  upon or measured by

 

income  or wages, the amount  which would be payable if the taxable year
ended on the Closing Date. Any  credit or prepayment

 

shall  be prorated based  upon the fraction employed in clause (i) of the
next preceding sentence.  In the case of any Tax based

 

upon  or measured by capital  (including net worth or long-term debt) or
intangibles, any amount thereof  required to be allocated

 

under  this _Section  11.1(d)_ shall be computed by reference to the level
of such items on the  Closing Date.

 

 

11.2 _Refunds  and Tax Benefits_.

 

 

 

       (a)   |  

Buyer  shall promptly pay or cause Company to pay to Seller any refund or 
credit  (including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto)
received  by  Buyer or Company of Taxes (i) relating to taxable periods
ending  on or  before the Closing Date or (ii) attributable to an amount
paid by  Seller  under _Section  11.1_ ,  but, in each case, only to the
extent that the right to such refund  or  credit was not included as an
asset of Company on the  Final Statement. Buyer shall, if Seller so requests
and at Seller's  expense, file for or cause Company to file for and obtain
any refund  to  which Seller (or Seller, indirectly through Company) is
entitled  under  this _Section  11.2_.  Buyer shall permit or cause
Company to permit Seller to control (at  Seller's expense) the prosecution of
any such refund claim, and shall  cause the relevant entity to authorize by
appropriate power of attorney  such Persons as Seller shall designate to
represent such entity with  respect to such refund claim.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

If  Seller pays an amount pursuant to _Section  11.1_ ,  and the underlying
adjustment resulting in the obligation of Seller  results in a Tax benefit to
Buyer, any subsidiary or any Affiliate  of  Buyer or Company or any entity
with which Company files a consolidated,  combined or unitary Tax Return for
a period or portion thereof beginning  after the Closing Date and ending on
or before the date of the Tax  payment  giving rise to the indemnity
obligation, then, upon Seller's request and  at Seller's expense and provided
that the period of limitations for  obtaining a refund  of  such Taxes has
not expired, Buyer shall file or cause Company to  file a  claim for refund
and diligently pursue the same. Buyer shall permit  or  cause Company to
permit Seller to control (at Seller's expense) the  prosecution of any such
refund claim, and shall cause the relevant  entity  to authorize by
appropriate power of attorney such Persons as Seller  shall  designate to
represent such entity with respect to such refund claim.  Buyer shall pay or
cause Company to pay to Seller, upon receipt of  any  such refund, the
amount of such refund attributable to the Tax benefit,  including allocable
interest to the extent actually  received.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

       (c)   |  

The  Company will be entitled to the Tax deduction with respect to the 
Replacement Awards and the Success Awards for the periods following  the 
Closing Date.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

11.3 _Contests_.

 

 

       (a)   |  

After  the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of the
commencement  of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or of
any  demand  or claim on Buyer or Company which, if determined adversely to
the  taxpayer or after the lapse of time, would be grounds for
indemnification  under _Section _ _11.1_ ,  within fifteen (15) days after
such commencement or the receipt of  such  demand or claim. Such notice to
Seller shall contain factual information  (to the extent known to Buyer or
Company) describing the asserted  Tax  liability in reasonable detail and
shall include copies of any notice  or  other document received from any Tax
authority in respect of any  such  asserted Tax liability. If Buyer fails to
give Seller notice of an  asserted Tax liability as required by this
_Section  11.3_ ,  then, if Seller is precluded by the failure to give such
notice from  contesting the asserted Tax liability in formal proceedings
before  either  the administrative or judicial forum, then Seller shall not
have  any  obligation to indemnify Buyer or Company for any loss arising
out  of such  asserted Tax liability.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

Seller  may elect to direct, through counsel of its own choosing and at its 
own  expense, any audit, claim for refund and administrative or judicial 
proceeding involving any asserted liability with respect to which  indemnity
may be sought under _Section  11.1_   (any such audit, claim for refund or
proceeding relating to an asserted  Tax liability is referred to herein as a
"Contest"); provided, however,  that Buyer and Company and their duly
appointed representatives shall  have  the right to participate in any such
Contest, at their own  expense,  to the extent that such Contest relates to
matters for periods after  the  Closing Date;  and provided, further, that
Seller shall obtain the consent of Buyer  and  Company prior to the
resolution or settlement of any such dispute  to the  extent it relates to
matters after the Closing Date, which consent  shall  not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If Seller elects to direct  a  Contest, within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the notice of asserted  Tax liability, Seller
shall notify Buyer of its intent to do so,  and Buyer  shall cooperate and
shall cause Company or its respective successor  or  successors to
cooperate, at Seller's expense, in each phase of such  Contest. If Seller
chooses to direct the Contest, Buyer promptly  shall  empower and cause
Company or its successor to empower (by power of  attorney and such other
documentation as may be necessary and appropriate)  such representatives of
Seller as it may designate to represent Buyer  or  Company or their
respective successors in the Contest insofar as  the  Contest involves an
asserted Tax for which Seller may be required  to  indemnify Buyer or
Company under _Section  11.1_.  If Seller elects not to direct the
Contest, 

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

         |  

fails  to notify Buyer of its election as herein provided or contests its 
obligation to indemnify under Section  11.1,  Buyer or Company may pay,
compromise or contest, at their own expense,  such asserted Tax liability
without prejudice to any right of Buyer  or  Company to indemnification if
otherwise entitled thereto  hereunder.

    
---|--- 
            |   
---|--- 
          (c)   |  

_Preparation  of Tax Returns_.  Seller shall cause to be prepared and filed
any Tax Return relating  to  Company for any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date.  Any  such Tax Return shall be prepared an a basis
consistent with those  prepared for prior Tax years unless a different
treatment of any  item is  required by an intervening change in law. Buyer
shall prepare or  cause  Company to prepare any Tax Return relating to
Company for any taxable  period ending after the Closing  Date.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

11.4 _Cooperation  and Exchange of Information_.   Seller and Buyer will
provide each other with such cooperation and information  as either of them
reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return,  amended return
or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a  right  to a
refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or other 
proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall
include  providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof,
together with  accompanying schedules and related work papers and documents
relating to rulings  or other determinations by Tax authorities. Each party
shall make its employees  available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
explanations of any  documents or information provided hereunder. Each party
will retain all returns,  schedules and work papers and all material records
or other documents relating  to Tax matters of Company for the taxable period
first ending after the Closing  Date and for all prior taxable periods until
the later of (i) the expiration  of  the statute of limitations of the
taxable periods to which such returns and  other documents relate, without
regard to extensions except to the extent  notified by the other party in
writing of such extensions for the respective  Tax  periods, or (ii) eight
years following the due date (without extension) for  such  returns. On or
prior to 120 days before a federal or state Tax Return is due  as  specified
by Seller, Buyer, at its expense, shall provide Seller with all Tax 
information for the Company, that Seller shall reasonably request (including 
schedule(s) showing the items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit
with  respect to each such taxable year required to be included in applicable
Tax  Returns and completed work papers specifically including Schedule M-3 as
well  as  complying with e-filing requirements) in such form as Seller shall
reasonably  request, including any such information as Seller may request to
enable Seller  to file any Tax Return with respect to any year that includes
a period ending  on  or before the Closing Date. Seller will prescribe the
information required  to be  provided by the Buyer to support Seller's
preparation and filing of combined  returns and payment of Estimated State
Taxes together with a schedule of due  dates for providing of such
information; (ii) Seller at its expense, shall  provide Buyer with all Tax
information that Buyer shall reasonably request  (including schedule(s)
showing the items of income, gain, loss, deduction and  credit with respect
to each such taxable year required to be included in any  applicable Tax
Return and completed work papers) for any period ending on or  before the
Closing Date; and (iii) without limiting the generality of the  foregoing,
each party shall use reasonable efforts to respond promptly to  specific
questions from the other party concerning Tax matters with respect  to 
which the represented party could reasonably be expected to have relevant 
information, and the information provided by each party shall be consistent 
with  any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

similar  information provided by such party to the other party for prior
taxable years.  In the event that one party does not provide the information
reasonably  requested by the other party on a timely basis, then the other
party may  engage  its own accountants to obtain the requested information
from records as the  first party's expense. Any information obtained under
this _Section  11.4_   shall be  kept confidential, except as may be
otherwise necessary in connection with  the  filing of returns or claims for
refund or in conducting an audit or other  proceeding.

 

 

 

11.5 _Miscellaneous_.

 

 

       (a)   |  

The  parties agree to treat all payments made under this _Section  11_ , 
under any other indemnity provision contained in this Agreement,  and for 
any misrepresentations or breach of warranties or covenants as adjustments 
to the Purchase Price for Tax  purposes.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

For  the purposes of this _Section  11_ ,  all references to Buyer, Seller
and Company include  successors.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (c)   |  

The  covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this 
_Section  11_   shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and
effect  with  respect to: (a) Seller's obligations until the expiration of
all statutes  of limitations with respect to any Taxes that would be
indemnifiable  by  Seller under _Section  11.1(a)_ ;  and (b) Buyer's
obligations until the expiration of all statutes of  limitations with respect
to any Taxes that would be indemnifiable  by Buyer  under _Section 
11.1(b)_   or  _Section  11.2_   of  this Agreement.

satisfied, or waived by  Buyer, on or prior to the Termination Date; 

 

provided,  however,  that (A) Seller shall be given the right to cure any
such breach or failure  for a period of thirty (30) days after

 

receiving written  notice of such breach or failure in order to avoid

(B)  Seller shall have  the right to extend the Termination Date for a
period not to exceed sixty (60)  days in the event the Permits and

 

Consents  have not  been obtained or the Minimum Sale-Leaseback Proceeds

and  provided further,  however, that Buyer shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement under  this  _Section  12.1(a)(ii)_   if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Buyer  is then  in material  breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements  contained in this Agreement and such

 

breach  shall have  been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the
failure of any such condition  to be satisfied on such date.

 

 

(iii) Seller  may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Buyer
if any conditions  to Seller's obligations to consummate

 

the transactions  contemplated in this Agreement shall not have been
satisfied, or waived by  Seller, on or prior to the Termination Date;

however,  that Seller  shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section  12.1(a)(iii)_   if  Seller is then in material breach

of  its  representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement  and such breach shall have been the cause of, or

 

shall  have resulted  in the failure of, any such condition to be satisfied
on such date.

 

 

(iv) if  any  Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction issues an
order, decree, ruling  or injunction, or takes any other action,

 

that permanently  enjoins, restrains or otherwise prohibits the transactions
contemplated  hereunder and such order, decree, ruling

 

or injunction has  become final and non-appealable; _provided_ ,  _however_
,  that  the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section _

 

_12.1(a)(iv)_   shall not  be  available to any party whose breach of any
provision of this Agreement results  in or causes such order, decree,

 

ruling  or injunction  or who  has  not used its reasonable best efforts
to prevent the entry of and to remove  such  order or injunction.

 

 

 

       (b)   |  

In  the event of termination of this Agreement by any party hereto as 
provided  in this _Section  12.1_ ,  this Agreement shall forthwith become

shall be applicable except in the  specific instance in which it is given.

 

 

13.11 _Severability_.   In the event that any provision in this Agreement
shall be determined to be  invalid, illegal or unenforceable, in any respect,
the remaining provisions  of  this Agreement shall not be in any way
impaired, and the illegal, invalid or  unenforceable provision shall be fully
severed from this Agreement and there  shall be automatically added in lieu
thereof a provision as similar in terms  and  intent to such severed
provision as may be legal, valid and  enforceable.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13.12 _Waiver  of Jury Trial_.   AS A SPECIFICALLY BARGAINED INDUCEMENT FOR

** NONCOMPETITION  AGREEMENT**

 

 

  THIS NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered into as of
this  ______ day of ___________________, 2006 (the "Effective Date") by and
among  LOGAN'S ROADHOUSE, INC (the "Company"), a Tennessee corporation, LRI
Holdings,  Inc., a Delaware corporation ("LRI") and CBRL GROUP, INC.
("CBRL"), a Tennessee  corporation.

 

 

**_W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :**

 

 

  WHEREAS, CBRL prior to the Effective Date, was the owner of the Company",
which  operated and franchised a chain of restaurants under the "Logan's
Roadhouse"® service mark ("Logan's restaurants"), which specialize in steaks
and serve  alcohol in an atmosphere designed to be reminiscent of an American
roadhouse  (the "Logan's System"); and

 

 

  WHEREAS, on the Effective Date, 2006, CBRL sold all of the outstanding
stock  of  the Company to LRI pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase
Agreement dated  as of  October 30, 2006 (as amended, supplemented, amended
and restated or otherwise  modified from time to time hereafter, the "Stock
Purchase Agreement"), between  CBRL and LRI; and

 

 

  WHEREAS, as an inducement to LRI to purchase all of the stock of the
Company  and  as a condition to the effectiveness and closing of the
transactions contemplated  by the Stock Purchase Agreement, LRI required CBRL
to enter into this  Agreement;

 

 

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained 
and in  the Asset Purchase Agreement, the parties, intending to be legally
bound,  agree  as follows:

 

 

  1. _Term_. The term  of this Agreement shall be three years, beginning on
the Effective Date,  2006,  and terminating on _____________, 2009

 

  (the " Term").

 

 

  2. _Agreements by  CBRL_.

 

 

  2.1. _Noncompete_. CBRL covenants and  agrees that, during the Term, it
will not, directly or indirectly, engage  in,  own, manage, operate, control
or provide consulting services to any food  service  business that conducts
activities similar to those operations conducted under  the Logan's System as
it was operated by the Company on the Effective Date  anywhere in the United
States of America. CBRL recognizes and acknowledges  that the geographic area
and time limitations set forth in this Agreement  are  properly required for
the protection of the business interests of the Company  and LRI due to CBRL
status and reputation in the industry and the knowledge  that  has been
acquired by CBRL through its ownership of and association with the  Logan's
System. If any part of this covenant not to compete is found to be 
unreasonable, then it may be amended by appropriate order of a court of 
competent jurisdiction to the extent deemed reasonable.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

  2.2. _Permitted Activities_.  Notwithstanding Section 2.1, the parties
acknowledge and agree  that CBRL  currently operates and, in the future, may
acquire additional restaurants  that  sell steaks, ribs, chicken and seafood
products and may continue to do so  so  long as the particular restaurant
concept is not or does not become a "roadhouse" concept similar to that
operated under the Logan's System as it was  operated by the Company on the
Effective Date. The Company and LRI further  acknowledge that CBRL shall not
be deemed to have violated Section 2.1. if  CBRL  acquires any operation:
(a) less than fifty percent (50%) of the revenues  of  which are derived
from business(es) that would otherwise violate Section  2.1; or  (b) that
either (i) does not serve alcoholic beverages or (ii) during any  consecutive
twelve month period averages less than thirty three percent of  its  sales
in the form of steaks.

 

 

  2.3. _Remedies_. In addition to any  other remedies that the parties may
have at law or in equity, CBRL, LRI and  the  Company agree that, in the
event of a breach by CBRL of the provisions of  Section 2.1., damages to the
Company and LRI would be difficult to  determine. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties agree that nothing  in this Agreement shall be
construed as prohibiting the Company or LRI from  pursuing any remedies
available to them for any breach or threatened breach  by  CBRL of Section
2.1., including, without limitation, the recovery of damages  from CBRL or
any person or entity acting in concert with CBRL. In the  event of any breach
or threatened breach by CBRL of Section 2.1., CBRL  understands and
acknowledges that a violation of these sections would cause  irreparable harm
to the Company and LRI and the Company and LRI would be  entitled to seek an
injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining  and restraining
CBRL from any act prohibited by this Agreement.

 

 

  3. _Notices_. All  notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and
delivered personally  or  mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the parties at their  last known addresses.

 

 

  4. _Waiver_. No  waiver, delay, omission or forbearance on the part of
either party to exercise  any right, option, duty, or power arising from any
default or breach by the  other party shall affect or impair the rights of
the non-defaulting party  with  respect to any subsequent default of the
same or a different kind; nor shall  any  delay or omission of the non-
defaulting party to exercise any right arising  from  any such default
affect or impair the non-defaulting party\'s rights as to  such  default or
any future default.

 

 

  5. _Severability_. If  any term, restriction or covenant of this Agreement
is deemed invalid or  unenforceable, all other terms, restrictions, and
covenants and the application  thereof to all persons and circumstances
subject hereto shall remain unaffected  to the extent permitted by law; and
if any application of any term, restriction  or covenant to any person or
circumstance is deemed invalid or unenforceable,  the application of such
terms, restriction or covenant to other persons and  circumstances shall
remain unaffected to the extent permitted by law.

 

 

  6. _Headings_.  Captions and section headings are used herein for
convenience only,  are not part  of this Agreement, and shall not be used in
construing it.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

  7. _Governing Law_.  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed  by the laws of  the State of Tennessee.

 

 

  8. _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each  of which shall  be deemed an original but all of which
shall constitute one instrument.

 

 

  9. _Entire  Agreement_. This Agreement contains the entire agreement
between the  parties hereto with respect to the matters addressed herein and
there are  no  representations, inducements, promises, agreements,
arrangements, or  undertakings, oral or written, between the parties that
have been relied  upon by  either of the parties other than those set forth
herein. No agreement of  any kind relating to the matters covered by this
Agreement shall be binding  upon  any party unless and until the same is
made in writing and executed by CBRL,  LRI  and the Company.

representative,  have executed this Agreement as of the date and year first
shown above.
