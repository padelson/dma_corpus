AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of October 7, 2015 by and among Gannett Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Jupiter Merger Sub, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Journal Media Group, Inc., a
Wisconsin corporation ("Company"). Capitalized terms used but not defined in
the context in which they are used shall have the respective meanings assigned
to such terms in Section 8.15.

  

  

WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to enter into a transaction whereby Merger
Sub will merge with and into Company, with Company surviving that merger on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the
"Merger");

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company
have adopted and approved this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; and

  

  

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with, and
to prescribe certain conditions to, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE 1

  

THE MERGER

  

  

Section 1.1. The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into Company in accordance
with the WBCL, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and
Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

Section 1.2. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall occur at
10:00 a.m., local time, on the third Business Day after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6, other than those conditions
that by their nature are intended to be satisfied at the Closing, or such
other time and date as Parent and Company shall agree in writing, unless this
Agreement has theretofore been terminated pursuant to its terms (the actual
time and date of the Closing is referred to as the "Closing Date"). The
parties intend that the Closing shall be effected, to the extent practicable,
by conference call, the electronic delivery of documents and the prior
physical exchange of certain other documents to be held in escrow by outside
counsel to the recipient party pending authorization by the delivering party
(or its outside counsel) of their release at the Closing. The Closing shall be
held at the offices of Foley and Lardner LLP, 777 East Wisconsin Avenue,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202 or such other place as Parent and Company shall
agree.

  

  

Section 1.3. Effective Time. Immediately following the Closing, Company and
Merger Sub shall cause the articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger"), in
such form as is required by the WBCL, to be executed, acknowledged and filed
with the Department of Financial Institutions

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

   
 

of the State of Wisconsin and make all other filings or recordings required by
the WBCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with the Department of
Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin or at such other time as
Merger Sub and Company shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger (the
"Effective Time").

  

  

Section 1.4. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the WBCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all the properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts,
liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, including those existing
pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement, dated as of July 30, 2014,
between, among others, Company, The E.W. Scripps Company and Journal
Communications, Inc. (the "Employee Matters Agreement"), the Scripps Tax
Matters Agreement, dated as of July 30, 2014, between Company and The E.W.
Scripps Company, the Journal Tax Matters Agreement, dated as of July 30, 2014,
between Company and Journal Communications, Inc. (collectively with the

Section 1.5. Articles of Incorporation. The Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation of Company in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall at the Effective Time be the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and applicable Law.

  

  

Section 1.6. Bylaws. The Bylaws of Company in effect as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall at the Effective Time be the bylaws of the

the provisions of the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
and applicable Law.

  

  

Section 1.7. Officers and Directors. The officers of Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall at the Effective Time be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall at the Effective Time be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  

  

Section 1.8. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Company ("Company Common Stock")
or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to Section
1.8(c), and after giving effect to Section 1.9(a)) shall be converted into the
right to receive cash in the amount of $12.00, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration").

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall
be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented any shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock, except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or applicable
Law.

  

  

(c) Any shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of Company or
owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
(including Merger Sub) or Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

(d) Each share of Merger Sub common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which
shares at such time shall comprise the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 1.9. Company Restricted Share Units.

  


 

  

(a) Company shall cause all awards of restricted share units ("Company RSUs")
heretofore granted under Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Company
Stock Plan") that have not heretofore vested to, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, become fully vested and without further restrictions with
respect to ownership rights thereto, thereby causing all shares of Company
RSUs (less shares withheld having a fair market value equal to the Taxes
required to be withheld with respect thereto) to become shares of Company
Common Stock that are converted into the right to receive, at the Effective
Time, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.8(a).

  

  

(b) The Company Stock Plan shall terminate, and all rights under any provision
of any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant
of any other interest with respect to the capital stock or other voting
securities of Company, or for the issuance or grant of any right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to receive benefits measured by the value of a number
of shares of Company Common Stock, shall be canceled, effective as of the
Effective Time, without any liability on the part of Company (except as
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement).

  

  

(c) To the extent the Surviving Corporation or Parent is required to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company RSUs with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or
any provision of any other Tax Law, the amounts so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Company RSUs in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be.

  

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall adopt resolutions so that the
Company Stock Plan shall terminate, and all rights under any provision of any
other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any
other interest with respect to the capital stock or other voting securities of
Company, or for the issuance or grant of any right of any kind, contingent or
accrued, to receive benefits measured by the value of a number of shares of
Company Common Stock, shall be canceled effective as of the Effective Time,
without any liability on the part

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

   
 

of Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent (except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement).

  

  

Section 1.10. Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, (a) the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall
have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different
number of shares or different class, in each case by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or
exchange of shares, (b) a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other
securities of Company shall be declared with a record date within such period
or (c) any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock and Company RSUs the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event.

  

  

ARTICLE 2

  

CONVERSION OF SHARES AND PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

  

  

Section 2.1. Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate, and enter into an agreement with, such bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the
"Paying Agent"), which agreement shall provide that, before the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent in
trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock cash in an amount
sufficient to effect payment of the Merger Consideration to which holders of
Company Common Stock are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8 and this Article 2.

  

  

Section 2.2. Payment Procedures.

  


 

  

(a) Promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days, after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Common Stock that were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8 (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Such letter of transmittal shall be in customary form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (with such letter of transmittal
being reasonably acceptable to Company prior to the Effective Time). Upon
surrender to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as Parent may
appoint of Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may
reasonably require, the holder shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business
Days, after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to issue
and send to each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares (including Book-Entry
Shares held through The Depository Trust Company) that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock that were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.8 a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Book-Entry Shares, without such holder being required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

   
 

of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be
cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the Merger Consideration.

  

  

(b) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is
registered, then it shall be a condition to the payment of such Merger
Consideration that (i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall have (A) paid any transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or (B) established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that any such Taxes either have been paid or are not
payable. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares
shall only be payable to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered.

  

  

Section 2.3. Undistributed Merger Consideration. Any portion of the funds made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.1 that remains
undistributed on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent or its designee, upon demand, and any holders of
Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2
shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws) for the Merger Consideration to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8 and this Article 2, and subject
to Section 2.4, Parent shall pay the Merger Consideration to such holders.

  

  

Section 2.4. No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective representatives shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration duly delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by the holders of Company Common
Stock at such date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of any claims or interests of any such shareholders or
their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled
thereto.

  

  

Section 2.5. Investment of Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent shall invest
the funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.1 as
directed by Parent on a daily basis, provided that no gain or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant
to Section 1.8 and this Article 2. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be the property of, and shall be paid to, Parent.

  

  

Section 2.6. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person
of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration, with any
interest thereon, with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby.

  

  

Section 2.7. Withholding Rights. To the extent that the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

   
 

pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
any other Tax Law, the amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Paying Agent, as the
case may be, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or Paying Agent, as the case may be.

  

  

Section 2.8. Stock Transfer Books. The stock transfer books of Company shall
be closed immediately upon the Effective Time, and there shall be no further
registration or transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the
records of Company. At or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares presented to the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall, subject to compliance with the provisions of this Article 2
by the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby.

  

  

ARTICLE 3

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

  

  

Except as set forth in Company SEC Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC
prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding any disclosures set forth in
any such Company SEC Reports solely under the heading "Risk Factors" or with
regard to the safe harbor for forward-looking statements) or in the disclosure
schedule delivered by Company to Parent prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (it being understood and
agreed that disclosure of any item in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed disclosure with respect to any section or subsection of this Agreement
to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure), Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

  

  

Section 3.1. Organization and Qualification. Each of Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing (to the extent such concept is legally recognized) under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has full
corporate or other power and authority to own, operate and lease the
properties owned or used by it and to carry on its business as and where such
is now being conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of Company and each
of its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation or other entity, and is in good standing (to the extent such
concept is legally recognized), in each jurisdiction wherein the character of
the properties owned or leased by it, or the nature of its business, makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
of Company, including any amendments thereto, filed with the SEC with the most
recent Company SEC Reports are correct and complete copies of such instruments
as presently in effect.

  

  

Section 3.2. Authorization; Board Approval. Company has full corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in the case of the consummation of
the Merger, to the approval of this

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
entitled to vote at the Company Shareholders Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof (the "Company Shareholder Approval"). The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Company, and no other corporate proceedings on
the part of Company or its shareholders are necessary to authorize this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, other than
the Company Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of
Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights or by general equity principles.

  

  

Section 3.3. No Violation.

  


 

  

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Company does not, and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by
Company will not, result in any violation of, or constitute a default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or result by its terms in the
termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, in the
loss of a benefit or in increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed
rights or entitlements of any Person under, or create any obligation to make a
payment to any other Person under, or result in the creation of a Lien (other
than Permitted Liens) on any assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to, (i) any provision of the articles of incorporation, bylaws or
similar organizational document of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
subject to obtaining or making the consents, approvals, Orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings referred to in Section
3.3(b), (A) any agreement, contract, note, mortgage, bond, indenture, lease,
benefit plan or other instrument (each, a "Contract") to which Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party, (B) any judgment, injunction, ruling, order or
decree (each, an "Order") or (C) any constitution, treaty, statute, law,
principle of common law, ordinance, rule or regulation of any Governmental
Entity or any rule or regulation of the New York Stock Exchange (each, a
"Law") applicable to Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case
of this clause (ii), as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) No consent, approval, Order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any supranational, national, state, provincial,
municipal, local or foreign government or any instrumentality, subdivision,
court, administrative agency or commission or other authority thereof (each, a
"Governmental Entity") or any other Person is required by or with respect to
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Company or the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby by Company, except for those
required under or in relation to (i) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") and other Regulatory
Laws, (ii) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act"), (iii) the
WBCL with respect to the filing of the Articles of Merger, (iv) any filings
required to be made with any Governmental Entity related to the Company
Permits and (v) such consents, approvals, Orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings the failure of which to make or
obtain, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Consents, approvals, Orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings required under or in
relation to any of clauses (i) through (iv) above are hereinafter referred to
as the "Necessary Consents."

Section 3.4. Capitalization. As of October 6, 2015 (the "Capitalization
Date"), the authorized capital stock of Company consisted entirely of
100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, of which 24,407,533 shares of Company Common Stock are issued and
outstanding and no shares of preferred stock are issued and outstanding. All
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable. As of the Capitalization Date, there were
Company RSUs representing the right to acquire up to an aggregate of 560,965
shares of Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Plan. Except as set
forth in this Section 3.4 and for changes since the Capitalization Date
resulting from the vesting of Company RSUs outstanding on such date, as of the

voting securities of Company issued or reserved for issuance, other than the
shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Company Stock
Plan, (B) securities of Company convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of Company, (C) options, warrants or
other rights to purchase from Company any capital stock or other voting

sale, transfer or redemption of any such capital stock or other voting
securities, any such convertible or exchangeable securities or any such
options, warrants or other rights.

issued and outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests of
all of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens,
and free of any other restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise
dispose of such capital stock or other equity interests. All capital stock or
other equity interests of each Subsidiary that are owned directly or
indirectly by Company are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a
true and complete list of Company's Subsidiaries and each such Subsidiary's
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. There are no outstanding
options, warrants, rights or other contracts pursuant to which Company or any
Subsidiary may be obligated to issue, sell or transfer equity securities or
pay other consideration in respect of the value of the capital stock or other
equity interests in Company's Subsidiaries, and there are no obligations of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any capital stock or other equity interests.

  

  

Section 3.6. Filings with the SEC; Financial Statements; No Undisclosed
Liabilities; Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  


 

  

(a) Company has filed or furnished, as the case may be, all required
registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents required to be filed or furnished by it with or to the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since January 1,
2015 (collectively, including all exhibits thereto, the "Company SEC
Reports"). None of Company SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (or, if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on
the date of such filing), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. All of Company SEC Reports, as of their respective
dates (or as of the date of any amendment to the respective Company SEC
Report), complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act"), and the
Exchange Act. No Subsidiary of Company is required to file any registration
statement, prospectus, report, schedule, form, statement or other document

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Each of the financial statements of Company included in Company SEC
Reports, as of their respective dates (and as of the date of any amendment to
the respective Company SEC Report), complied as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP")
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted under the Exchange
Act) applied on a consistent basis during the periods and the dates involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position and consolidated
results of operations and cash flows of Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates or for the respective periods set
forth therein, subject to, in the case of the unaudited interim financial
statements, the absence of notes and normal year-end adjustments.

  

  

(c) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated
balance sheet of Company prepared in accordance with GAAP, except liabilities
(i) as and to the extent reflected or reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of Company and its Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2015 (including
the notes thereto) included in Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended June 30, 2015 (the "Company Balance Sheet"), (ii) incurred after
June 30, 2015 in the ordinary course of business, (iii) incurred as a result
of the execution of this Agreement or (iv) that, individually or in the

Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(d) Company has implemented and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) under the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of its consolidated financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The management of
Company has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
required by Rule 13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act). The management of Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of its system of internal
control over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, to
Company's outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of its internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Company's
internal control over financial reporting.

  

  

Section 3.7. Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement will not, on the date the
Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to
the shareholders of Company, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading nor will the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), at the time of the Company
Shareholders Meeting, omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of
proxies for the Company Shareholders Meeting that shall become false or
misleading in any material respect. The Proxy Statement will, when filed by
Company with the SEC, comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company makes no representation or
warranty with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub that is contained in the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto.

Section 3.8. Absence of Certain Changes. Except as contemplated by this
Agreement, from June 30, 2015 until the date of this Agreement, there has not
been (a) any event, occurrence or development that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (b) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend

material increase in severance or termination pay to any executive officer,
except pursuant to Company's Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan or
as required under employment, severance or termination agreements in effect as
of the date of the most recent financial statements included in Company SEC
Reports, (f) any change in accounting methods, principles or practices by

under the Company Credit Agreement or (i) any other action taken by Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that, if taken after the date hereof and prior to the

action, suit, arbitration, proceeding, investigation or inquiry pending or, to
the knowledge of Company, threatened against Company or any of its
Subsidiaries before or by any Governmental Entity or arbitrator that, if
decided adversely to Company or any Subsidiary of Company, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date hereof, there is no claim, action, suit, arbitration,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry pending or, to the knowledge of Company,
threatened against any officer or director of Company that is reasonably
likely to result in any liability on the part of Company, whether or not such
liability is insured.

  

  

Section 3.10. Laws and Orders. Company and its Subsidiaries are and have been
at all times since April 1, 2015 in compliance with all Laws and Orders to
which they are subject, except where the failure to so comply, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Since April 1, 2015, Company and its
Subsidiaries have not received written notice or, to the knowledge of Company,
oral notice of any material violation or alleged material violation of any
Laws or Orders. All reports, registrations and returns required to be filed by
Company and its Subsidiaries with any Governmental Entity have been filed, and
were accurate and complete when filed, except where such failure to file or to
be accurate and complete when filed, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

Section 3.11. Licenses and Permits. Each of Company and its Subsidiaries has
all licenses, permits, franchises, approvals, authorizations, registrations,
certifications, accreditations and consents of all Governmental Entities
(collectively, the "Company Permits") that are necessary or

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

   
 

required for the lawful conduct of its business as conducted by it as of the
date of this Agreement, except for failures to have any Company Permits that,

its Subsidiaries is violating any Company Permits, except for such violations
that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since April 1, 2015,
none of Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of any
action pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened by any Governmental
Entity to revoke, withdraw, modify, restrict or suspend any Company Permit,
and no event has occurred which, with or without the giving of notice, the
passage of time, or both, has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to
result in, a revocation, withdrawal, modification, restriction or suspension
of any Company Permit, except for any such events that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(a) The Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list, as
of the date of this Agreement, of all "employee benefit plans," as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), and all other material employee benefit or compensation
Contracts, arrangements and perquisite programs that are maintained by Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
obligated to contribute, for current or former directors or employees (or
dependents or beneficiaries thereof) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Employee Benefit Plans"); provided, however, that the
Company Disclosure Schedule does not include Employee Benefit Plans that
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is legally required to maintain pursuant to
the Law of any jurisdiction. Except for the 2016 Plans and as required by the
Employee Matters Agreement, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any other express commitment (x) to adopt any plan or arrangement that would
be an Employee Benefit Plan if in existence on the date hereof, or (y) to
modify, change or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan other than with respect
to a modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the Code or that
does not increase the costs to Company or its Subsidiaries of the benefits
provided under such Employee Benefit Plan.

  

  

(b) All Employee Benefit Plans have been administered in accordance with their
terms and in compliance with applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code,
except for instances of noncompliance where the failure to so administer or
comply, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(c) None of Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any entity within the same
"controlled group" as Company or any of its Subsidiaries within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA (an "ERISA Affiliate") has (i) withdrawn from a
"multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a
"Multiemployer Plan"), for which any material withdrawal liability has not
been satisfied in full , (ii) engaged in any transaction that is subject to
Section 4069 of ERISA or (iii) has incurred any material liability under Title
IV of ERISA or Code Section 412 that has not been satisfied in full and, to
the knowledge of Company, no fact or event exists which would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such material liability. None of Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate is a party to any multiple employer
plan, as that term is defined in Section 413(c) of the Code, or a multiple
employer welfare arrangement, as that term is defined in Section 3(40) of
ERISA.

  

  

(d) None of Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has
received notice from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation of any
outstanding liability under Section 4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation or to a trustee appointed under

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 4042 of ERISA. None of the Employee Benefit Plans that is subject to
Title IV of ERISA has been terminated so as to subject, directly or
indirectly, any assets material to Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole to any outstanding liability, contingent or otherwise, or the imposition
of any outstanding Lien under Title IV of ERISA. No "reportable event" (as
defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred in the period commencing on
April 1, 2015 and ending on the date of this Agreement with respect to any
such plan for which a waiver was not available or with respect to which a
filing was not made. No such plan that is subject to Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code has incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as
defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code).

  

  

(e) The Internal Revenue Service has issued a currently effective favorable
determination letter or, with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan utilizing a
prototype document, an opinion letter that may be relied on by such plan with
respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be a "qualified
plan" within the meaning of Section 401 of the Code. No such determination
letter or opinion letter has been revoked nor, to the knowledge of Company,
has revocation been threatened, and no such Employee Benefit Plan has been
amended since the date of its most recent determination letter, opinion letter
or application therefor in such a manner that would materially adversely
affect its qualification. To the knowledge of Company, no act or omission has
occurred with respect to the operation of any such Employee Benefit Plan, in
each case, which, either individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of such qualification.

  

  

(f) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened claims,
actions, lawsuits, arbitrations, proceedings or inquiries by or on behalf of
any participant or beneficiary in any Employee Benefit Plan, or otherwise
involving any such Employee Benefit Plan or the assets of any Employee Benefit
Plan, other than routine claims for benefits or claims that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have or reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

payments by Company or any of its Subsidiaries in an amount in excess of
$1,000,000 (collectively, the "Company Contracts").

  

  

(b) Each of Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of Company, the
other Person or Persons thereto has performed all of its obligations required
to be performed by it under each Company Contract, except for instances of
noncompliance where the failure to comply, individually or in the aggregate,
would not constitute a material default under the provisions of the applicable
Company Contract. Company has made available to Parent a true and complete
copy of

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

15

Agreement. All premiums due and payable to date under all such policies have
been paid. None of Company or any of Company Subsidiaries has received notice
of cancelation or termination with respect to such policies.

Section 5.2. Proxy Statement; Company Shareholders Meeting.

  


 

  

(a) Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, a proxy statement in preliminary
form and related materials with respect to the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby (collectively, including all amendments or supplements
thereto, the "Proxy Statement"). Parent shall cooperate in the preparation of
the Proxy Statement and shall promptly provide to Company any information
regarding Parent and its Subsidiaries that is necessary or appropriate to
include in the Proxy Statement. Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement
complies as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Exchange Act. Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC and mailed to its shareholders in
definitive form as promptly as reasonably practicable after its filing with
the SEC. Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt
thereof, provide Parent with copies of all written comments, and advise Parent
of all oral comments, with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the
SEC.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, prior to filing the Proxy Statement (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final
version of such document or response), (ii) shall include in such document or
response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (iii) shall not file
or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of
Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  

  

(c) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Company, or any of its Subsidiaries, officers or directors should be
discovered by Parent or Company that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, then the party hereto that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto, and to the extent
required by Law, Company shall promptly file with the SEC and disseminate to
its shareholders an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information.

  

  

(d) Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Bylaws of Company, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a special meeting of its shareholders (the "Company Shareholders
Meeting") as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit the Company Shareholder Approval. Company shall, acting
through the Company Board, recommend to its shareholders that they adopt this
Agreement and approve the Merger and shall include such Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, except to the extent that the Company Board has made a Change
in Recommendation as permitted by Section 5.5. Once the Company Shareholders
Meeting has been called and noticed, Company shall not postpone or adjourn the
Company Shareholders Meeting, except (i) with the consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) to
the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement that Company reasonably determines to be necessary under applicable
Law is

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

   
 

provided to its shareholders in advance of a vote on approval of this
Agreement or (iii) if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there
are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
Company Shareholders Meeting or to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval.

  

  

Section 5.3. Access to Information. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time, except (a) for competitively sensitive information, (b) for information
that, if provided, would adversely affect the ability of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to assert attorney-client or attorney work product privilege or a
similar privilege or (c) as limited by applicable Laws (including Regulatory
Laws), Company shall cause its officers and the officers of its Subsidiaries
to furnish Parent with such financial and operating data and other information
with respect to the business and properties of Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that all requests for such
information pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall be made through Mr. Jason
Graham, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of
Company or Ms. Hillary Ebach, Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate
Secretary of Company. Parent shall, and shall cause its authorized
representatives to, use their reasonable best efforts to minimize any
disruption to the businesses of Company and its Subsidiaries that may result
from the requests for data and information pursuant to this Section 5.3.
Information obtained by Parent or its representatives pursuant to this Section
5.3 shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
as of August 19, 2015, between Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), which shall remain in full force and effect, and Parent and each
such representative shall be deemed to be a party thereto.

  

  

Section 5.4. Cooperation; Reasonable Best Efforts.

  


 

  

(a) Each of Company and Parent shall cooperate with and assist the other
party, and shall use its reasonable best efforts, to promptly (i) take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to ensure that the
conditions set forth in Article 6 are satisfied and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable, including preparing
and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications and other documents, and (ii) obtain and maintain
all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations required to be obtained from any other Person, including any
Governmental Entity, that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby in the most expeditious manner
practicable, but in any event before the Outside Date (including obtaining the
Necessary Consents). None of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or any of their
respective Affiliates shall take any action, refrain from taking any action or
permit any action to be taken which is inconsistent with this Agreement or
which would reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay or to prevent
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
shall (i) make or cause to be made an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and appropriate filings under all other
applicable Regulatory Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days, after the date of this Agreement, and Parent and Company shall
each bear their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with such
filings, provided that Parent shall pay any filing fees in connection
therewith, and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts (A) to respond at the
earliest practicable

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

   
 

date to any requests for additional information made by the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC") or any other Governmental Entity, (B) to take all actions necessary to
cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other applicable
Regulatory Laws to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date, (C) to
take all actions necessary to obtain any necessary approval under applicable
Regulatory Laws, (D) to resist in good faith, at each of their respective cost
and expense, any assertion that the transactions contemplated hereby
constitute a violation of the Regulatory Laws, and (E) to eliminate every
impediment under any Regulatory Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible
(and in any event no later than the Outside Date), all to the end of
expediting consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Such
reasonable best efforts of Parent shall include, to the extent such actions
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
the business of Parent and Parent's Affiliates (including, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation) taken as a whole, the obligation of Parent to
agree to hold separate, divest or enter into a consent agreement or assume any
obligation with regard to (1) any of the businesses, product lines or assets
of Parent or Parent's Affiliates, (2) after the Effective Time, any
businesses, product lines or assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries acquired pursuant to this Agreement and/or (3) after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
(including entering into customary ancillary agreements relating to any such
divestiture of businesses, product lines or assets) as may be required by any
applicable Governmental Entity (including the DOJ, the FTC or any court having
jurisdiction), in each case, to facilitate the expiration of any applicable
waiting period under any Regulatory Law, to secure the termination of any
investigation by any Governmental Entity, to avoid the filing of any suit or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity or private party seeking to enjoin the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order
or other Order in any suit or proceeding that would otherwise have the effect
of restraining, preventing or delaying the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. To the extent such reasonable best efforts of Parent
and/or Company would require Parent and/or Company to hold separate, divest or
enter into a consent agreement or assume any obligation with regard to Parent,
Company or any of their Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses,
product lines or assets, Parent's and/or Company's effectuation of such
actions shall be contingent upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no action taken by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall
entitle Parent to any reduction of the Merger Consideration. Except as
otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, take any action or
knowingly omit to take any action within its reasonable control where such
action or omission would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in (I)
any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 6 not being satisfied
prior to the Outside Date or (II) a material delay in the satisfaction of such
conditions. Neither Parent nor Company will directly or indirectly extend any
waiting period under the HSR Act or other Regulatory Laws or enter into any
agreement with a Governmental Entity to delay or not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement except with the prior written
consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed in light of closing the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on or before the Outside Date.

  

  

(c) In connection with this Section 5.4, the parties hereto shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Laws, (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing, submission, investigation or inquiry,
(ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication received by such
party from, or given by such party to, the DOJ or the FTC or any other
Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

   
 

proceeding by a private party, in each case, regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each shall consult the other on, any filing made with, or
written materials to be submitted to, the DOJ, FTC or any other Governmental
Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, any other
Person, in connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(iv) consult with each other in advance of any meeting, discussion, telephone
call or conference with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person,
and to the extent not expressly prohibited by the DOJ, the FTC or any other
Governmental Entity or Person, give the other party hereto the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences, and, to the extent
practicable, telephone calls, in each case, regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties hereto may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this Section 5.4 as "Outside Counsel Only." Such materials
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
directors, officers or employees of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Company or Parent, as
the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 5.4, materials provided to the other party hereto or
its counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of
Company and its Subsidiaries or other competitively sensitive information.

  

  

Section 5.5. Acquisition Proposals; Change in Recommendation.

  


 

  

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.5, following the execution
of this Agreement, (i) Company shall, and shall cause its directors, officers,
employees, representatives and other agents, including investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors (collectively, the
"Representatives"), and its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease any discussions
or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished and (ii) Company shall not, and
Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and the Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly, (A) encourage (including by way of furnishing or disclosing
information), solicit, request or initiate any other action to facilitate or
initiate the making of any Acquisition Proposal, (B) continue or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose any
information to, any Person (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, (C) terminate, amend, modify or
waive any provision of any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any actual or
potential Acquisition Proposal, (D) take action for the purpose of exempting
any Person other than Parent and Merger Sub from the application of any
"control share acquisition," "fair price," "business combination" or other
anti-takeover Law, including the provisions of Section 180.1141 and 180.1150
of the WBCL, or (E) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle or merger, acquisition or similar
agreement contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.5(b)) (each,
a "Company Acquisition Agreement"). Company represents and warrants to Parent
that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any waiver or release
under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5, at any time
prior to the time, but not after, the Company Shareholder Approval is
obtained, Company and the Representatives may participate in discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish or disclose nonpublic information to, any Person
in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

   
 

is submitted to Company by such Person after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the time that the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained if (i) the
Company Board determines in good faith, (A) after consultation with a
nationally recognized financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal that was not solicited by Company and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 5.5 and (B) after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to Company's shareholders under applicable Laws, (ii) prior
to participating in discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing or
disclosing any nonpublic information to, such Person, Company receives from
such Person, an executed confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality
terms and a "standstill" or similar covenant not materially less restrictive
upon such Person than the terms applicable to Parent under the Confidentiality
Agreement, (iii) concurrently with furnishing or disclosing any nonpublic
information to such Person, Company furnishes or discloses such information to
Parent (to the extent such information has not been previously delivered or
made available by Company to Parent), and (iv) prior to taking any of the
actions referred to in the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), Company shall
have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it
intends to take such action.

  

  

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.5, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or
qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, in any
manner adverse to Parent the Recommendation (it being understood that the
Company Board may refrain from taking a position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal until the close of business of the tenth (10th) Business
Day following a written request by Parent to the Company Board to affirm the
Recommendation after the first public announcement of such Acquisition
Proposal without such action being considered an adverse modification) or (ii)
approve, authorize or recommend or otherwise declare advisable, or propose
publicly to approve, authorize or recommend or otherwise declare advisable,
any Acquisition Proposal or Company Acquisition Agreement (each, a "Change in
Recommendation"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
5.5, at any time prior to the time, but not after, the Company Shareholder
Approval is obtained, the Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation if
(A) Company provides Parent with written notice indicating that Company,
acting in good faith, believes that the applicable Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and,
therefore, plans to conduct a meeting of the Company Board for the purpose of
considering whether the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
which notice shall be delivered to Parent at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the date of such meeting of the Company Board and shall also include
a copy of such Acquisition Proposal (or, where no such copy is available, a
reasonably detailed description of such Acquisition Proposal) and the identity
of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, (B) during the three Business
Day period after Company provides Parent with the written notice described in
clause (A) above, Company shall cause its financial and legal advisors to
negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent so chooses to
negotiate) in an effort to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement such that the Acquisition Proposal would not constitute a
Superior Proposal, (C) notwithstanding the negotiations and adjustments
pursuant to clause (B) above, the Company Board, after consultation with a
nationally recognized financial advisor and outside legal counsel, makes the
determination that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
and (D) notwithstanding the negotiations and adjustments pursuant to clause
(B) above, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failing to approve or recommend a Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to the Acquisition Proposal would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Company's shareholders under
applicable Laws. Any material amendment to such Acquisition Proposal,
including any revision to price, shall require

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Company to deliver to Parent a new written notice and again comply with the
provisions of clauses (A)-(D) of this Section 5.5(c); provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5, the obligation
of Company to deliver Parent with a notice under this Section 5.5(c) shall
only apply twice with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and/or Superior
Proposal from any particular Person.

  

  

(d) In addition to the obligations of Company set forth in Section 5.5(a),
Section 5.5(b) and Section 5.5(c), (i) Company shall promptly advise Parent
orally and in writing (and in any case within 24 hours) of any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the
identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and
(ii) Company shall (A) keep Parent fully and promptly informed of the status
and material details (including any change to any material term thereof) of
any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and (B) provide to Parent promptly
after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other
written material sent or provided to Company or any of its Subsidiaries from
any Person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry.

  

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.5 shall prohibit the Company Board,
directly or indirectly through the Representatives, from taking and disclosing
to the shareholders of Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or from making any disclosure to Company's shareholders required by
applicable Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act, an express rejection of any Acquisition Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Recommendation shall not be deemed to be a Change in
Recommendation for purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.6. Indemnification; Exculpation; Insurance.

  


 

  

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts
to respond to and defend against any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
arbitration, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, in which any Person who is now, or who at any time prior to
the date of this Agreement was, or who prior to the Effective Time becomes, a
director, officer or employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including
in his or her role as a fiduciary of the employee benefit plans of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is
threatened to be, made a party or a witness, in whole or in part, as a result
of or relating to (i) the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a
director, officer or employee of Company, any of its current or former
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time (collectively, the "Indemnified Claims").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Indemnified Party shall furnish an
undertaking to Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
consistent with the form undertaking that such Indemnified Party would have
been required to provide to Company pursuant to the Bylaws of Company assuming
such Indemnified Person's expenses were advanced pursuant to such Bylaws, to
repay any expenses incurred in connection with such response or defense if it
is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification with respect thereto pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 5.6.

  

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, to an extent at least as
favorable as the indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions
contained in the constituent documents

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

   
 

of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party from and against all
losses, claims, damages and liabilities, joint or several, to which such
Indemnified Party may become subject under any applicable Laws or otherwise
and relating to, arising out of or in connection with any Indemnified Claim
and (ii) reimburse each Indemnified Party for all expenses (including
reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) as they are incurred in
connection with any Indemnified Claim. If indemnification or reimbursement is
sought under this Section 5.6 by an Indemnified Party, then such Indemnified
Party shall notify Parent of the Indemnified Claim; provided, however, that
the failure to notify Parent shall not relieve Parent from any liability or
obligation that it may have under this Section 5.6 or otherwise to such
Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
Parent. Following such notification, Parent may elect in writing to assume the
defense of such Indemnified Claim (and the costs related thereto), and upon
such election, Parent shall not be liable for any legal costs subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Party (other than costs of investigation or the
production of documents or witnesses) unless (A) Parent has failed to provide
legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in a timely
manner or (B) such Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that (1)
the representation of such Indemnified Party by legal counsel selected by
Parent would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interest
or (2) there may be legal defenses reasonably available to such Indemnified
Party that are different from or additional to those available to Parent or
any other Indemnified Party represented by such legal counsel, in which case
such Indemnified Party may employ separate legal counsel to represent or
defend him or her in such proceeding. Nothing set forth in this Section 5.6(b)
shall preclude any Indemnified Party from retaining its own counsel at its own
expense. Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the applicable
Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in
any matter in respect of which indemnification or advancement of expenses
could be sought under this Section 5.6(b) (whether or not any Indemnified
Party is an actual or potential party to such matter) unless such settlement,
compromise or judgment includes a provision unconditionally releasing such
Indemnified Party and all other Indemnified Parties from and holding them
harmless against all liability in respect of claims by any releasing party
related to or arising out of such matters or any transaction or conduct in
connection therewith. Parent's obligations under this Section 5.6(b) shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights in respect of an
Indemnified Claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such Indemnified Claim.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the foregoing: (i) during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the articles of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions contained in the articles
of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, and during such
six-year period, such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner, except as required by applicable Laws; and (ii) all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
the Indemnified Parties as provided in any indemnification agreements shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, as
of the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall, or if Company is unable,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to,
obtain and fully pay the premium for a non-cancellable extension of Company's
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years after the Effective
Time in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time,
including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, covering each
person currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy, and each person who becomes covered by the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy prior to the Effective
Time, on the same terms as the Company's existing policy, provided that the
premium for such "tail" policy shall not exceed 300% of the aggregate annual
premiums that Company is paying with respect to Company's directors' and
officers' insurance policy for the current policy period that includes the
date of this Agreement. If Company and the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policy as of the Effective Time,
then for six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, directors' and officers'
liability insurance coverage in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, covering each person currently covered by Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy, and each person who becomes covered by
Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy prior to the
Effective Time, on the same terms as Company's existing policy or, if such
insurance coverage is unavailable, coverage that is on terms no less favorable
to such persons than those of Company's existing policy; provided, however,
that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.6(d), neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in
excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premiums that Company is paying with
respect to Company's directors' and officers' insurance policy for the current
policy period that includes the date of this Agreement, but in such case
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase as much
coverage as possible for such amount.

  

  

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause
proper provisions to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.6.

  

  

(f) The provisions of this Section 5.6 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution of, any
other rights, including rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses,
that any Indemnified Party may be entitled to or hereafter acquire under any
Law, agreement, provision of Company's or the Surviving Corporation's articles
of incorporation or bylaws or otherwise.

  


 

  

Section 5.7. Employee Benefits.

  


 

  

(a) Until December 31, 2016, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay each employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is in employment
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
an amount at least equal to the annual base salary or hourly wage rate, as
applicable, that was being paid to such individual as of the day immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If the employment of any employee of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is terminated on or prior to
December 31, 2016, Parent shall pay (or cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay) such employee a severance benefit that shall in no

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

   
 

event be less than, or paid later than, the severance benefit, if any, to
which such employee would have been entitled if Company's severance plan,
policy or practice, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
applied to such termination of employment. Until December 31, 2016 (or for an
employee covered by a Company Contract such longer period as may be provided
in any Company Contract with the employee), Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to (a) maintain in effect on behalf of employees of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries all severance, retirement, bonus
and other compensation and benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements
and policies (other than any equity-based plans) of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as in effect, or as to be in effect, as applicable, on January 1,
2016 (the "Existing Plans") and (b) provide the employees of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries the same opportunity to participate in
Parent's equity-based plans as are provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent. Parent shall take all actions required so that eligible employees of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall receive service credit
for all purposes, other than benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension
plan, under any successor employee benefit plans and arrangements sponsored by
Parent that are offered to such employees. To the extent that Parent either
provides coverage to the employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries other
than under the Existing Plans or modifies any of the Existing Plans, with
respect to employees who participated in the Existing Plan immediately prior
to the modification of the Existing Plan or the provision of coverage under a
like replacement plan, Parent shall ensure that such plans waive any
applicable waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or actively-at-work
requirements and shall give such employees credit under the new coverages or
benefit plans for deductibles, co-insurance and out-of-pocket payments that
have been paid during the year in which such coverage or plan modification
occurs.

  

  

(b) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months following the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the editorial
staffing levels existing as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in all
newsrooms of Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything provided in this Section 5.7, each employee of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, is covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be
provided with compensation and benefits consistent with the terms of the
applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement in effect. Nothing in this Section
5.7 shall create any third-party beneficiary right in any Person other than
the parties to this Agreement, or create any right to continued employment.

  

  

Section 5.8. Company Indebtedness. As of the Effective Time, Company shall,
with Parent's cooperation, use reasonable best efforts (which shall not
include the incurrence by the Company of costs) to take all such actions as
are necessary and appropriate to obtain at the Effective Time pay-off letters
in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent evidencing the amount (the "Pay-
off Amount") necessary to pay-off, at the Effective Time, all existing
indebtedness and other obligations (including outstanding letters of credit)
under the Company Credit Agreement. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, pay, on behalf of Company,
the Pay-off Amount to an account or accounts designated by the administrative
agent under the Company Credit Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.9. Public Announcements. The initial press release relating to this
Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by Company and Parent, and
thereafter Parent and Company shall consult with each other before issuing,
and provide each other the opportunity to review, comment upon and concur
with, any press release or other public statement with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall
not issue any such

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

   
 

press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as either party may determine (based on the advice of outside legal
counsel) is required by applicable Laws; provided, however, that the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.9 shall not apply to any release or
announcement made or proposed to be made (a) following a determination by the
Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
(b) following a Change in Recommendation as permitted by Section 5.5 or (c)
pursuant to Section 5.5(e).

  

  

Section 5.10. Shareholder Litigation. Subject to any fiduciary duties of the
board of directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Company shall
consult with Parent in Company's defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation (other than any litigation or settlement where the interests of
Company or any of its Affiliates are adverse to those of Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates) against Company and/or any of its
directors or executive officers relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, provided that Company shall not settle, compromise or enter
into an agreement regarding any settlement or compromise of any shareholder
litigation relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other
than any settlement solely for monetary damages paid entirely from proceeds of
insurance, except for any applicable deductible) requiring the payment of any
amount, acceptance of any liability, or admission of any violations of Law by
Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Parent (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

Section 5.11. Anti-Takeover Laws. In the event that any state anti-takeover or
other similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 5.12. Stock Exchange Listing. Promptly following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to cause Company Common Stock to
be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the
Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 5.13. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall
take all actions as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (and derivative securities with respect
to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Company to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 5.14. Resignations. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall cause
each member of the Company Board to execute and deliver a letter, which shall
not be revoked or amended prior to the Effective Time, effectuating his or her
resignation as a director of Company effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

been the cause of such inaction and (B) the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) shall apply only if the Law, Order or act or

entitled to rely on such condition shall not elect to waive such condition; or

  

  

(d) By either Parent or Company, if the Company Shareholder Approval shall not
have been obtained at the Company Shareholder Meeting at which a vote on such

event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this
Agreement shall become null and void and shall have no further force or effect
without liability of

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

   
 

any party or parties hereto, as applicable (or any partner, member,
shareholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate, agent or other
representative of such party or parties) to the other party or parties hereto,
as applicable, except (a) for the terms of the last sentence of Section 5.3,
this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article 8, each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and (b) subject to Section 7.3, nothing in this
Agreement shall relieve any party or parties hereto, as applicable, from
liability for any willful and material breach of, or fraud in connection with,
this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.3. Termination Fees.

  

  

(a) If:

  

(i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to clauses (i) or (iii) of
Section 7.1(g);

  

  

(ii) Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h); or

  

  

(iii) Parent or Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)
or Section 7.1(d) or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to clause (ii)
of Section 7.1(g) and, in the case of such termination, (A) at any time after
the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise publicly communicated
to the Company Board or shareholders of Company and not publicly withdrawn
(such Acquisition Proposal, the "Outstanding Proposal") and (B) prior to the
date that is twelve (12) months after the effective date of such termination,
Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to the Outstanding
Proposal and the Outstanding Proposal is subsequently consummated (whether or
not such consummation occurs within such twelve-month period); provided that
references to "more than fifteen percent (15%)" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "more than fifty
percent (50%)",

  

  

then Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee equal to $9,000,000 (the
"Company Termination Fee"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
one or more accounts designated in writing by Parent, (x) in the case of
termination pursuant to clause (i) above, within two (2) Business Days of the
date of such termination, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, concurrently

which Company consummates the transaction with respect to the Outstanding
Proposal.

  

  

(b) In no event shall Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee
on more than one occasion whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be
payable at the same or at different times and/or based upon the occurrence of
different events.

  

  

(c) In the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is paid in
accordance with Section 7.3(a), Parent's receipt of the Company Termination
Fee from Company pursuant to Section 7.3(a) shall, subject to Section 7.3(d),
be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 7.3(c) shall limit the rights of Parent, Merger Sub or
Company under Section 8.11 and in no event shall a party's liability for fraud
or willful and material breach of this Agreement be so limited.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to Section 7.3(a) and, to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Company for the amount set
forth in Section 7.3(a), then Company shall pay Parent's or Merger Sub's
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in
connection with such suit. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 7.3(d)
shall accrue interest at the prime lending rate published in the Wall Street
Journal and in effect on the date of payment, with such interest being payable
in respect of the period from the date that payment was originally required to
be made pursuant to Section 7.3(a) through the date of payment.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that this Agreement is terminated or deemed terminated as described in Section
7.3(a), Parent's receipt of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section
7.3(a) shall, subject to Section 7.3(d), be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates against Company, its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current, or future
shareholders, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for any loss or
damages suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7.3(e) shall limit the rights
of Parent, Merger Sub or Company under Section 8.11 and in no event shall a
party's liability for fraud or willful and material breach of this Agreement
be so limited.

Section 8.7. Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest.

  


 

  

(a) This Agreement (including any Schedules, Exhibits and/or Annexes attached
hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute (together with the other
documents and instruments to be executed and delivered pursuant hereto) the
entire agreement, and supersede all prior understandings, agreements or
representations, by or among the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof.

  

  

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (i)
as provided in Section 5.6 (the provisions of which are intended to be for the
benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons),
(ii) after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Company Common
Stock to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.8 and
Article 2 (which rights are intended to be for the benefit of such holders and

of the holders of Company Common Stock and Company RSUs, to pursue specific
performance as set forth in Section 8.11.

  

  

Section 8.8. Assignment; Binding Effect. No party hereto may assign, transfer

however, that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time
in part, to one or more of its Affiliates, but no such assignment shall
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and
permitted assigns.

  

  

Section 8.9. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Wisconsin without giving effect to any choice or conflict of
law provision or rule. Each party hereto stipulates that any dispute or
disagreement between or among any of the parties hereto as to the
interpretation of any provision of, or the exercise of any rights or the
performance of obligations under, this Agreement shall be commenced and
prosecuted in its entirety in, and consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and
proper venue of, any Wisconsin state court or any federal court located within
the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and each party hereto consents to personal
and subject matter jurisdiction and venue in such courts and waives and
relinquishes all right to attack the suitability or convenience of such venue
or forum by reason of their present or future domiciles, or by any other
reason. The parties hereto acknowledge that all directions issued by the forum
court, including all

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

injunctions and other decrees, will be binding and enforceable in all
jurisdictions and countries. Each party hereby waives its right to a trial by
jury of any claim or cause of action arising out of or relating to Parent's
investigation of Company, this Agreement, the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement or any Contract entered into pursuant hereto (except to the
extent otherwise expressly set forth therein) and the performance by the
parties of its or their terms in any action, proceeding or other litigation of
any type brought by one party against another, regardless of the basis of the
claim or cause of action.

  

  

Section 8.10. Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, then all other terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner so that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

  

  

Section 8.11. Enforcement of Agreement. The parties hereto agree that money
damages or any other remedy at law would not be a sufficient or adequate
remedy for any actual or threatened breach or violation of, or default under,
this Agreement by any of them and that, notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, each aggrieved party shall be entitled, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, to an injunction restraining such actual or
threatened breach, violation or default and to any other equitable relief,
including specific performance, without bond or other security being required.

  

  

Section 8.12. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by signatures
exchanged via facsimile or other electronic means and in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  

  

Section 8.13. Headings. The Article and Section headings contained in this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.14. Interpretation. Any reference to any supranational, national,
