the payments required by this _Article III_ , and following any losses from
any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares and Membership Units,

Shares and payment of the Aggregate Membership Unit Consideration to holders

3.02(b)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to
fund payments pursuant to _Section 3.02(b)_, except to the extent expressly
provided for in this Agreement.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. As promptly as practicable after the Company Merger

record of a Certificate, in each case whose Shares or Membership Units, as
applicable, were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
at the Company Merger Effective Time or the Partnership Merger Effective
Time, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal,
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 3.02(f)_)
to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree; and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with  _Section 3.02(f)_)
for cancellation to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor (A) the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock
Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates
were converted pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)(i)_ (less required withholdings
as provided in  _Section 3.05_) or (B) the portion of the Aggregate
Membership Unit Consideration into which the Membership Units formerly
represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_
(less required withholdings as provided in _Section 3.05_), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company or a transfer of ownership of Membership
Units that is not registered in the transfer records of the Operating
Partnership, Merger Consideration may be paid to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying
Agent any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment
of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of
the Certificate so surrendered or shall establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent and Parent that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not required to be paid.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares and Book-Entry Membership Units_. Any holder of Book-
Entry Shares or Book-Entry Membership Units shall not be required to deliver
a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to
receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Article III_. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of
one or more Book-Entry Shares or Book-Entry Membership Units shall
automatically upon the Company Merger Effective Time or Partnership Merger
Effective Time, as applicable, be entitled to receive, and the Surviving
Company or Surviving Partnership, as applicable, shall cause the Paying Agent
to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company Merger
Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable 

 



17  (but in no event more than five Business Days thereafter), the Merger
Consideration (less required withholdings as provided in _Section 3.05_) for
each Book-Entry Share or Book-Entry Membership Unit, as applicable. Payment
of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares and Book-Entry
Membership Units shall only be made to the person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares or Book-Entry Membership Units, as applicable, are registered.

Units.

Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
any Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
on the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in

Certificates (or automatically in the case of Book-Entry Shares) shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. From and after the Company Merger
Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If,
after the Company Merger Effective Time, Certificates representing such Shares
are presented to the Surviving Company for transfer, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the unit transfer books of the
Operating Partnership shall be closed with respect to any Membership Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (other
than those held by the Company immediately prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time) and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Membership Units outstanding immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time (other than any Membership Units held by the
Company immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time) on the
records of the Operating Partnership. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ upon surrender of any
Certificates (or automatically in the case of Book-Entry Membership Units)
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Certificates or Book-Entry Membership Units. From and after
the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the holders of Membership Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (other
than the Company) shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Membership Units except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
If, after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, Certificates representing
Membership Units outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time (other than any Membership Units held by the Company
immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time) are presented to
the Surviving Partnership for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this Agreement.

(e)  _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any
time following the first anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to
it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with
respect thereto) not disbursed to former holders of Shares or

 



18  Membership Units, and thereafter such former holders shall be entitled to
look only to the Surviving Company or Surviving Partnership, as applicable
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Shares or Membership Units and compliance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 3.02(b)_, without interest. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Surviving
Partnership or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any former holder of a
Share or Membership Unit for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership, as
applicable, shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which
the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate were converted into the
right to receive pursuant to  _Section 3.01(a)(i)_ or the portion of the
Aggregate Membership Unit Consideration into which the Membership Units
formerly represented by such Certificate were converted into the right to
receive pursuant to  _Section 3.01(c)(i)_, as the case may be; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide a bond in a customary
amount.

SECTION 3.03 _Treatment of RSU Awards, Performance Awards, DSU Awards and
Equity Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. Prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Companys board of directors (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that,
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and without any action
on the part of any party, each outstanding award of restricted stock units
with respect to Shares (each, an " _RSU Award_ ") granted pursuant to a
Company Stock Plan, shall be fully vested and cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each holder of any such cancelled RSU Award shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, in consideration of
the cancellation of such RSU Award and in settlement therefor, an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number
of restricted stock units subject to such RSU Award, without interest (such
amounts payable hereunder, the " _RSU Payments_ ") (less required withholdings
as provided in _Section 3.05_). Each RSU Award shall be settled at the
Company Merger Effective Time pursuant to _Section 3.03(e)_, or at such later
time as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax consequences under
Section 409A of the Code.

 

(b) _Treatment of Performance Units and Performance Shares_. Prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time, the Companys board of directors (or, if

to Shares (each, a " _Performance Award_ ") granted pursuant to a Company
Stock Plan, shall be vested at the level calculated using the Merger
Consideration as the applicable measure of the Companys performance and using
the average closing market price of the

 



19  Companys designated peer group during the 60-day trading period ending on
the date of this Agreement as the applicable measure of peer group performance
and cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled
vested Performance Award shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such
vested Performance Award and in settlement therefor, an amount in cash equal
to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of
performance units or performance shares, as the case may be, subject to such
vested Performance Award, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder,
the " _Performance Award Payments_ ") (less required withholdings as provided
in _Section 3.05_). Each Performance Award shall be settled at the earlier of
the Company Merger Effective Time pursuant to  _Section 3.03(e)_ or the
normal vesting date of such Performance Award, or at such later time as
necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax consequences under Section
409A of the Code.

 

(c) _Treatment of Deferred Stock Units_. Prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time, the Companys board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that, immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, all outstanding deferred stock
units (each, a " _DSU Award_ ") granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan,
shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such
cancelled DSU Award shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such DSU
Award and in settlement therefor, an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of deferred stock units
subject to such DSU Award, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder,
the " _DSU Payments_ ") (less required withholdings as provided in _Section
3.05_). Each DSU Award shall be settled at the Company Merger Effective Time
pursuant to _Section 3.03(e),_ or at such later time as necessary to avoid
a violation and/or adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.

(d) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. As of the Company Merger Effective
Time, all Company Stock Plans shall terminate and no further RSU Awards,
Performance Awards, DSU Awards or other rights with respect to Shares shall be
granted thereunder.

 

(e) _Parent Funding_. At the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Surviving Company cash in the amount necessary to make the
payments required under this _Section 3.03_, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to make the payments required under this _Section 3.03_ as
promptly as practicable after the Company Merger Effective Time, or at such
later time as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax consequences
under Section 409A of the Code. Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to
pay through the Payroll Agent the applicable RSU Payments, Performance
Award Payments and DSU Payments, if any, to the holders of RSU Awards,
Performance Awards and DSU Awards (less required withholdings as provided in
_Section 3.05_).

 

SECTION 3.04 _Dissenters  or Appraisal Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal
rights shall be available with respect to the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 3.05 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company, the
Surviving Partnership and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable in respect of the Shares,
Membership Units, RSU Awards,

 



20  Performance Awards and DSU Awards cancelled in the Mergers such Tax amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, any regulation promulgated thereunder by the United
States Department of Treasury (a " _Treasury Regulation_ ") or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that Tax amounts are
so withheld by the Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership, Parent or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld Tax amounts (a) shall be
remitted by the Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership, Parent or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (b)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Shares, Membership Units, RSU Awards, Performance Awards and DSU
Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership, Parent or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be.

SECTION 3.06 _Tax Treatment_. The parties intend that for federal, and
applicable state, income tax purposes the Company Merger shall be treated as a
taxable sale by the Company of all of the Companys assets to Merger Sub in
exchange for the applicable portion of the Aggregate Common Stock
Consideration to be provided to the stockholders of the Company and the
assumption of all of the Companys liabilities, followed by a distribution of
the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration to the stockholders of the Company
in liquidation pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code, and that
this Agreement be, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan of liquidation" of the
Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

furnished to the SEC. None of the Company Subsidiaries is currently required
to file any forms or reports with the SEC. The Company has made available to
Parent all comment letters and all material correspondence between the SEC, on
the one hand, and the Company or the Operating Partnership, on the other
hand, since January 1, 2013. As of the date hereof, there are no

respect to any of the reports filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC
and, as of the date hereof, to the Companys knowledge, none of the Company
SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review. The Company is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange. The audited consolidated
financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements
of the Company (including, in each case, any notes thereto) and the
consolidated Company Subsidiaries included in or incorporated by reference
into the Company SEC Documents (collectively, the " _Company Financial
Statements_ ") (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP (as in effect in the
United States on the date of such Company Financial Statement) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as
permitted by SEC rules and regulations) and (ii) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company and the consolidated
Company Subsidiaries and the results of their operations and their cash flows
as of the dates and for the periods referred to therein (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of interim financial
statements, for normal year-end adjustments). Neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries is required to be registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

SECTION 4.07 _Information Supplied_. The proxy statement to be sent to the
Companys stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting

") will not, at the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Companys
stockholders, at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting or at the time
of any amendment or supplement thereof, as applicable, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy
Statement, insofar as it relates to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or
other information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein, will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
other applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation
or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the Buyer
Parties or any of their Representatives specifically for inclusion (or
incorporation by reference) in the Proxy Statement.

SECTION 4.08 _Internal Controls and Disclosure Controls_. The Company has
designed and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) intended to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting
for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The Company has designed
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance that material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms
and is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 



28 SECTION 4.09 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as otherwise contemplated by

other than liabilities and obligations (a) disclosed, reserved against or

to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 4.11 _Litigation_. There is no suit, claim, action, investigation or
proceeding which is against the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any of
their property or assets (including any Company Real Property)) pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing that, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to
any outstanding order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree of any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator unrelated to this Agreement that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, there is no suit,
claim, action or proceeding to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is

former director, independent contractor, officer or employee, including bonus

each case, contributed to, or sponsored or maintained by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, or pursuant to which the Company or any Company

provided for a period of 12 months or less following termination of employment
or during any period during which the former employee is receiving severance
pay).

 

(d) No Company Benefit Plan is, and at no time during the six-year period
prior to the date of this Agreement has the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates maintained, contributed to or had
any obligations or liabilities with respect to a plan that is subject to
Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary sponsors or maintains an employee
stock purchase plan.

(f) _Section 4.12(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each Company
Benefit Plan that may provide for payment (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property), whether alone or as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Mergers, to any

"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) and
is not deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of the Code. No
Company Benefit Plan exists that, as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (whether alone

former 

 



30  employee, director, officer or independent contractor of the Company or any

or Section 4999 of the Code, or any interest or penalty related thereto.

(h) All Company Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code have been determined by the IRS to be so qualified or may
rely on an opinion or advisory letter with respect to a prototype or volume
submitted plan, or a timely application for such determination is now pending
or there is time remaining for such an application, and the Company has no
knowledge of anything that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of
such qualification.

 

SECTION 4.13 _Labor_.

 

(a) No employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is
represented by any union or covered by any collective bargaining agreement.
No labor organization or group of employees of the Company or any of the

certification, and there are no representation or certification proceedings or
petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened to be brought or filed, with the National
Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations Governmental Entity, except

have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. 

 



31 SECTION 4.14 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed (taking into
account any extension of time within which to file) all material Tax Returns
required to be filed by it and all such filed Tax Returns are correct,
complete and accurate in all material respects, and has paid all material
Taxes to the extent due and payable (whether or not shown as due on such filed
Tax Returns). All material Taxes which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
has been required by law to withhold or to collect for payment from amounts
owing to any employee, creditor, equity holder or third party have been duly
withheld and collected and have been paid to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, to the extent due and payable. There are no material Liens upon any
property or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary related to Taxes,
except for Permitted Liens.

 

(b) _Section 4.14(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each Company
Subsidiary that is classified as a REIT (each, a " _REIT Subsidiary_ "). The

been subject to taxation as a REIT within the meaning of Section 856 of the
Code and has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements
for qualification and taxation as a REIT for such years and (ii) have operated
in a manner that will permit it to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year
that includes the date hereof and/or the Closing Date. No challenge to the
Companys or any REIT Subsidiarys status as a REIT is pending or has been
threatened in writing by any Governmental Entity. No Company Subsidiary,
excluding any Company Subsidiary in which the Company holds 10% or less by
both vote and value, within the meaning of Code Section 856(c)(4)(B)(iii), is
a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, other than a corporation
that qualifies as a "qualified REIT subsidiary," within the meaning of Section
856(i)(2) of the Code, or as a "taxable REIT subsidiary," within the meaning
of Section 856(1) of the Code.

 

(c) Each Company Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture, or limited
liability company and which has not elected to be a "taxable REIT subsidiary"
within the meaning of Code Section 856(1) (i) has been since its formation
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded
entity, as the case may be, and not as a corporation or an association
taxable as a corporation and (ii) has not since the later of its formation or
the acquisition by the Company of a direct or indirect interest therein owned
any assets (including securities) that have caused the Company to
violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code or would cause the Company to violate

the date hereof.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2011, (i) the Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries have not incurred any material liability for Taxes under
Sections 857(b), 857(f), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code or Section 337(d) of the
Code (and the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder) and (ii) neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any material liability
for Taxes that have become due and that have not been previously paid other
than in the ordinary course of business. Since January 1, 2011, neither the

any subsidiary of a "taxable REIT subsidiary") has engaged at any time in any
"prohibited transactions" within the meaning of Section 857(b)(6) of the Code.
Since January 1, 2011, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
engaged in any transaction that would give rise to "redetermined rents,
redetermined deductions and excess interest" described in Section 857(b)(7) of
the Code. To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2011, no event
has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a
material risk that any material Tax described in the preceding sentences will
be imposed on the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 



32 (e) There are no Tax Protection Agreements currently in force.

 

(f) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has since January 1, 2011
granted in writing a waiver to extend the statutory period of limitations
applicable to the assessment or collection of any material Taxes or
deficiencies against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. There is
no action, suit, investigation, audit, examination, proceeding, claim or
assessment pending with respect to material Taxes imposed on, or material Tax
matters relating to, the Company or any Company Subsidiary and neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been notified in writing that a taxing
authority intends to commence any such action, suit, investigation, audit,
examination, proceeding, claim or assessment. Since January 1, 2011, no
material deficiency with respect to Taxes has been assessed in writing against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary which has not been fully paid,
otherwise resolved or adequately reserved in the Company Financial Statements.
Since January 1, 2011, no written claim has been made by any taxing authority
in a jurisdiction where neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
filed Tax Returns asserting that the Company or any Company Subsidiary is or
may be subject to material Taxes imposed by that jurisdiction.

 

(g) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary (i) is or has since January
1, 2011 been a member of an affiliated group of corporations filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return or (ii) has any material liability for
Taxes of another person (other than the Company or a Company Subsidiary) under
Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law) as a result of filing Tax Returns on a consolidated, combined, or
unitary basis with such person or as a transferee or successor. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any Tax
Sharing Arrangement (other than a Tax Sharing Arrangement solely among the
Company and any wholly-owned Company Subsidiaries). Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code.

(h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary holds any asset, the
disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the
Code (or otherwise result in any "built-in gains" Tax under Section 337(d) of
the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder).

(i) Since January 1, 2011, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
requested a private letter ruling from the IRS or comparable rulings from
other taxing authorities.

(j) Since January 1, 2011, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
entered into any "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code
(or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income
Tax law). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary: (i) since January
1, 2011, has agreed to make any material adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a)
of the Code, (ii) has any knowledge that the IRS has proposed, in writing,
since January 1, 2011, such an adjustment or a change in accounting method
with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (iii) has any
application pending with the IRS or any other taxing authority requesting
permission for any change in accounting method.

holding such leasehold interest. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,

condemnation or rezoning proceedings are pending or threatened, with respect
to any of the Company Real Properties. Except as would not, individually or

any person with respect to any Competing Proposal or the making of any

a Competing Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Company
Subsidiary to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any
standstill or confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party, in each case with respect to the submission of any
Competing Proposal, except to the extent to allow the applicable party to make
a confidential Competing Proposal to the Companys board of directors.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but
subject to the Companys compliance with the provisions of _Section 6.03_),
if, at any time following the date hereof and prior to the Company obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company has received a written
unsolicited bona fide Competing Proposal (it being agreed that the board of
directors of the Company may correspond in writing with any person making such
a written Competing Proposal to request clarification of the terms
and conditions thereof so as to determine whether such Competing Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal)
from a person that did not result from a breach of _Section 6.03(a)_ and (ii)
the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, then the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Competing
Proposal and its Representatives and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Competing Proposal and its
Representatives regarding such Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company (1) will not, will not permit the Company Subsidiaries to,
and will not authorize any of the Companys Representatives to, disclose any
non-public information regarding the Company to such person without first
entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such person and
will as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 48 hours thereafter)
advise Parent in writing of the receipt of any Competing Proposal, the
material terms and conditions thereof (including, if applicable, providing
copies of any written Competing Proposals and drafts of proposed agreements
related thereto) and the identity of any person making such Competing
Proposal, (2) will as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24
hours thereafter) after receipt of any request for non-public information
relating to it or any Company Subsidiary or for access to its or any of the

Companys knowledge, is reasonably likely to make, or has made, a Competing
Proposal, notify Parent orally and in writing of such receipt, (3) will

any event within 48 hours thereafter) notify Parent of any change to the
financial and other material terms and conditions of any Competing Proposal
and otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of any such
Competing Proposal, including by providing copies of all proposals, offers and
drafts of proposed agreements related thereto. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into
any confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit it from providing
such information to Parent.

 



48 (c) Except as set forth _Section 6.03(d)_ or _Section 6.03(e)_, neither
the Companys board of directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) adopt,
authorize, approve or recommend (or publicly propose to adopt, authorize,
approve or recommend) any Competing Proposal, (ii) withhold, modify or amend
(or publicly propose to withhold, modify or amend), in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation, (iii) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action set forth in the foregoing
_clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ , a " _Change of Company Recommendation_ ") or
(iv) authorize or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement relating to any Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring the Company or the Operating
Partnership to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (any of the foregoing referenced in this clause
(iv), an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company
is not in breach of this _Section 6.03_ in any material respect the board of
directors of the Company may make a Change of Company Recommendation and may
cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with  _Section
8.01(f)_, if:

(i) (A) a written Competing Proposal (that did not result from a breach of
_Section 6.03(a)_) is made to the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any
person, and such Competing Proposal is not withdrawn and (B) the Companys
board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal;

(ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the Companys
intention to make a Change of Company Recommendation (a " _Notice of Change of
Recommendation_ "), which notice shall identify the person making such
Superior Proposal and include the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal, including, if applicable, copies of any written
proposals or offers and any proposed agreements related thereto (it being
agreed that the delivery of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by the
Company shall not constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

(iii) the Company has negotiated (and caused its Representatives to negotiate)
in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with
respect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
order to obviate the need to make such Change of Company Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.01(f)_ for at least three
(3) Business Days following receipt by Parent of such Notice of Change of
Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Change of Recommendation and the Company shall be
required to comply again with the provisions of this _Section 6.03(d)_,
_provided_ that, in the case of any such amendment, the reference to three
(3) Business Days in this clause (iii) shall instead be two (2) Business Days
following receipt by Parent of any such new Notice of Change of
Recommendation); and

 



49 (iv) at the end of such three (3) Business Day period (or two (2) Business Day
period, if applicable), and taking into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company, the Companys board of
directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal even if such changes proposed
by Parent were given effect.

 

(e) Other than in connection with a Competing Proposal (which shall be subject
to _Section 6.03(d)_ and shall not be subject to this  _Section 6.03(e)_),
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Companys board of
directors from withholding, modifying or amending in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation if prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval:

(i) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of
the Companys board of directors to effect a Change of Company Recommendation
would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its duties under applicable
Law;

 

(ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of its intention to take
such action, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons
therefor (it being agreed that the delivery of such notice by the Company
shall not constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

 

(iii) the Company has negotiated (and caused its Representatives to negotiate)
in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with
respect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
order to obviate the need to make such Change of Company Recommendation for at
least three (3) Business Days following receipt by Parent of such notice; and

(iv) at the end of the three (3) Business Day period described in the
foregoing _clause (iii)_ , and taking into account any changes to this
Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company, the Companys board of directors
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure of the Companys board of directors to effect
a Change of Company Recommendation would reasonably be likely to be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law even if such changes
proposed by Parent were given effect.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Companys board of
directors from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if the Companys board of directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make such disclosure would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its
duties under applicable Law to the stockholders of the Company (for
the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or
the Companys board of directors of a "stop, look and

 



50  listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not
constitute a Change of Company Recommendation) or is required by applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Companys board
of directors shall be permitted to recommend that the stockholders of the
Company tender any securities in connection with any tender offer or exchange
offer that is a Competing Proposal or effect a Change of Company
Recommendation with respect thereto, except as permitted by _Section
6.03(d)_. The Company and the Companys board of directors shall not take any
actions to exempt any person from the "Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit" or the
"Common Stock Ownership Limit" or establish or increase an "Excepted Holder
Limit," as such terms are defined in the Company Charter unless such actions
are taken concurrently with the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 8.01(f)_.

 

SECTION 6.04 _Proxy Statement; Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file a preliminary Proxy Statement
with the SEC. The Proxy Statement shall include the Company Recommendation,
except to the extent the Companys board of directors has made a Change of
Company Recommendation in accordance with _Section 6.03_. Parent
shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement,
and shall furnish all information concerning it, Merger Sub and Guarantor that
is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the preparation of
the Proxy Statement. The parties shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such filing. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement or any related documents (or in each case, any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with an opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response and shall consider in good faith any
comments on such document or response reasonably proposed by Parent. The
Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments to the
Proxy Statement from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and will promptly supply Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the Company and the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) If, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, is
discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall as promptly as
practicable notify the other party. Following such notification, the Company
shall file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information as promptly as practicable after Parent has had a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, the Company shall disseminate such amended or
supplement to the stockholders of the Company.

 



51 (c) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Companys stockholders in
accordance with _Section 6.04(a)_, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of the holders of the Company Common Stock for the purpose of
seeking the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_
"). The Companys board of directors shall recommend that the Companys
stockholders give the Company Stockholder Approval (the "
_Company Recommendation_ ") except to the extent the Companys board of
directors has made a Change of Company Recommendation in accordance with
_Section 6.03_, and the Company shall, except to the extent there has been a
Change of Company Recommendation or this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the
Company Stockholder Approval, including by soliciting proxies from the holders
of the Company Common Stock in favor thereof. The Company shall keep Parent
updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by
Parent. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the
Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Competing
Proposal. The obligation of the Company to duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and mail the Proxy Statement (and any
amendment or supplement that may be required by Law) to the Companys
stockholders shall not be affected by a Change of Company Recommendation.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company may adjourn, recess or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting, after
consultation with Parent, (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of
the Company Stockholder Meeting, (ii) if as of the time for which the Company
Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting or to the extent that
at such time the Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder
Meeting; _provided_ , that, in the case of this clause (ii), without the
consent of Parent, in no event shall the Company Stockholder Meeting (as so
postponed or adjourned) be held on a date that is more than thirty (30) days
after the date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting was originally
scheduled or (iii) to the extent required by applicable Law. 

SECTION 6.05 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement to the
Company Merger Effective Time, the Company Parties shall, and shall cause
each Company Subsidiary to: (a) provide to the Buyer Parties and their
respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of any
business conducted by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, upon prior
written notice to the Company, to the officers, employees, properties, offices
and other facilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the
books and records thereof; and (b) furnish promptly such information
concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets and liabilities of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as Parent or its Representatives may
reasonably request;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Parties shall
not be required to (or to cause any Company Subsidiary to) afford such access
or furnish such information to the extent that the Company Parties believe in
good faith that doing so would: (i) result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege; (ii) violate any obligations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary

 



52  with respect to confidentiality to any third party or otherwise breach,
contravene or violate any then effective Contract to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is party; (iii) result in a competitor of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary receiving information that is competitively sensitive;
or (iv) breach, contravene or violate any applicable Law (including any
Antitrust Law) (provided that the Company Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that
does not result in the events set out in clauses (i) through (iv)). Subject to
_Section 6.07(b)_, Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective Representatives, to hold all information provided
or furnished pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ confidential in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. During any visit to the business
or property sites of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each of
the Buyer Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives
accessing such properties to, comply with all applicable Laws and all of
the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries safety and security procedures.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, from the date of
this Agreement to the Company Merger Effective Time, none of the Buyer Parties
or any of their respective affiliates or Representatives shall, without the
prior written consent of the Company, conduct any environmental investigation
at any Company Real Property involving any sampling or other intrusive
investigation of air, surface water, groundwater, soil or anything else at or
in connection with any Company Real Property. No investigation under this
_Section 6.05_ or otherwise shall affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company Parties or any condition
to the obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement.

SECTION 6.06 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Buyer
Parties and each of the Company Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts

the foregoing, each of the Buyer Parties and each of the Company Parties

any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary or advisable, (iii)
defend all lawsuits or other legal, regulatory, administrative or other

transactions contemplated hereby and (vi) execute and deliver any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



53 (b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
6.06_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of
the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or legal proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any
communication to or from or any Governmental Entity regarding the Mergers.
Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will
consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any
filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument,
opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may be prohibited by
any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, each party hereto will
permit authorized representatives of the other parties to be present at each
meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or legal proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with
any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity
in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal
proceeding.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
6.06_, each party hereto shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any third party consents necessary or advisable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event
that the parties hereto shall fail to obtain any third party consent
described above, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts,
and shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize
any adverse effect upon the Company and the Company Subsidiaries resulting, or
which would reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time, from
the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from
any person (other than a Governmental Entity) with respect to any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, (i) none of the Company or any Company

the Buyer Parties or any of their affiliates shall be required to pay
or commit to pay to such person whose approval or consent is being solicited
any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or
other obligation. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory

Time, of those directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary designated
by Parent to the Company in writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 6.06_ shall prohibit or otherwise limit the
right of the Company Parties to take any action they are permitted to take
under _Section 6.03_. The parties obligations with respect to any Debt
Financing shall be governed by _Section 6.07_ and not this _Section 6.06_.

 



54 SECTION 6.07 _Financing_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall Parent or any of its affiliates, in connection with the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby, enter into any Contract
with any bank or investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity
financing on an exclusive basis or otherwise on terms that prohibit or
otherwise restrict such provider from providing or seeking to provide such
financing to any person in connection with a transaction relating to the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries. Parent may disclose non-public
information regarding no more than four (4) of the Company Real Properties
(and in the Companys sole discretion, additional Company Real Properties) to

financing sources) (and in the Companys sole discretion, additional
potential purchasers of such assets (and their advisors and financing
sources)); _provided_ that to the extent any such potential purchaser of
assets does not enter into a confidentiality agreement with the Company, such
person shall be considered a Representative of Blackstone Real Estate Advisors
L.P. under the Confidentiality Agreement and Blackstone Real Estate Advisors
L.P. and Parent shall be responsible for any use or disclosure of such
information by such potential purchaser (or its advisors or financing sources
thereof) in breach of the Confidentiality Agreement. Parent may disclose non-
public information regarding the Company to up five (5) potential Debt
Financing sources (and their advisors); _provided_ that any such potential
Debt Financing source shall enter into an agreement with the Company with
confidentiality and use provisions regarding the Companys information that
are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (" _Approved Debt Financing Sources_ "). Subject
to the prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, Parent may disclose non-public information regarding the Company to
additional potential Debt Financing sources (and their advisors); _provided_
that any such additional potential Debt Financing source shall enter into an
agreement with the Company with confidentiality and use provisions regarding
the Companys information that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and upon
receipt of such consent and entering into such agreement, such additional
potential Debt Financing source shall be deemed to be an Approved Debt
Financing Source.

(b) Prior to the Closing, at Parents sole expense, the Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use commercially reasonable

cooperate to facilitate the pledging of, granting of mortgages and security
interests in and obtaining perfection of any liens on, collateral in

Company fails to cure such breach by the earlier of 10 Business Days after

liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with any
Debt Financing (including any action taken in accordance with this _Section
6.07(b)_) and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
information provided by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries).

(c) Each of the Buyer Parties acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
consummation of the Mergers shall not be conditioned on, or delayed or
postponed as a result of the obtaining of (or the failure to obtain) the
Equity Financing or any Debt Financing and, (ii) prior to any termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, they shall continue to be
obligated to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Equity Financing or
any Debt Financing, subject to the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_
and _Section 7.02_.

(d) _Cooperation Regarding Existing Indebtedness_. Promptly following
Parents request, the Company shall deliver to each of the lenders under the
Existing Indebtedness (the " _Existing Loan Lenders_ ") a notice (an "
_Existing Loan Notice_ ") prepared by Parent, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company, notifying each of the Existing Loan
Lenders of this Agreement and the contemplated Mergers. At Parents election,
the Existing Loan Notice with respect to one or more of the Existing Loan
Documents may include a request for a consent, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company (an " _Existing Loan Consent_ "), to (1)
the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (2) to certain modifications of the Existing Loan
Documents; _provided_ that, the consummation of the Mergers shall not be
conditioned on, or delayed or postponed as a result of the receipt of (or
failure to receive) any such Existing Loan Consent. Without limiting the
foregoing, in connection with any Existing Indebtedness that Parent intends
not to repay or cause the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries not to
repay at the Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with Parent in connection with contacting any such Existing Loan
Lender regarding maintaining the applicable Existing Indebtedness after
Closing (provided that the Company shall have the right to participate in any
discussions). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
6.07(d)_, the condition set forth in _Section 7.02(b)_, as it applies to the
Companys obligations under this _Section 6.07(d)_, shall automatically be
deemed satisfied, except to the extent the Company has materially and
willfully breached its obligations under this _Section 6.07(d)_, Parent has
provided to the Company written notice of such breach within 10 Business Days
of first becoming aware of such breach and the Company fails to cure such
breach by the earlier of 10 Business Days after such notice is provided or the
Outside Date. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation under this _Section 6.07(d)_. Parent shall pay all fees and
expenses payable in connection with any Existing Loan Consents and the
maintenance of any Existing Indebtedness from and after the Company Merger
Effective Time.

 



57 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.07_, the
Company Parties shall not be required to (or to cause any Company Subsidiary
to) afford access or furnish information pursuant to this _Section 6.07_ to
the extent that the Company Parties believe in good faith that doing so would:
(i) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege; (ii) violate any
obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to
confidentiality to any third party or otherwise breach, contravene or violate
any then effective Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
party; (iii) result in a competitor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
receiving information that is competitively sensitive; or (iv) breach,
contravene or violate any applicable Law (including any Antitrust Law)
(provided that the Company Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in the
events set out in clauses (i) through (iv)).

 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations contained in this _Section
6.07_ shall terminate upon the occurrence of the Closing. 

SECTION 6.08 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release issued by
Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be in a form agreed to by Parent and the Company and
thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other (and obtain
the other partys consent) before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except (a) as may be required by applicable
Law, court process or the New York Stock Exchange if the party issuing such
press release or other public statement has, to the extent practicable,
provided the other party with an opportunity to review and comment, (b) any
press release or other public statement that is consistent in all material
respects with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by a party hereto in accordance with this Agreement, in each
case under this clause (b) to the extent such disclosure is still accurate,
and (c) in connection with any Change of Company Recommendation made in
accordance with this Agreement.

SECTION 6.09 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and the Surviving
Partnership to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each current or former director or officer of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and each fiduciary under benefit
plans of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each an "
_Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against
(i) all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses),
judgments, fines, claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of
the next sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (and
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Company Merger
Effective Time) to the extent that they are based on or arise out of the fact
that such person is or was a director, officer or fiduciary under benefit
plans, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party
of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement,
(the " _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to
the extent they are based on or arise out of or pertain to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Company 

 



58  Merger Effective Time, and including any expenses incurred in enforcing such
persons rights under this _Section 6.09_; _provided_ , that (x) none of
Parent, the Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership shall be liable
for any settlement effected without their prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and (y) except
for legal counsel engaged for one or more Indemnified Parties on the date
hereof, none of Parent, the Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership
shall be obligated under this _Section 6.09(a)_ to pay the fees and expenses
of more than one legal counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable
Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with
respect to any single legal action except to the extent that, on the advice of
any such Indemnified Partys counsel, two or more of such Indemnified Parties
shall have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action. In the event
of any such loss, expense, claim, damage or liability (whether or not asserted
before the Company Merger Effective Time), the Surviving Company or
the Surviving Partnership, as applicable, shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly, and in any
event within 10 days, after statements therefor are received and otherwise
advance to such Indemnified Party upon request, reimbursement of documented
expenses reasonably incurred (provided that, if legally required, the person
to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if
it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to
indemnification under Law).

(b)  _Insurance_. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, and if the Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company to, obtain and fully pay the premium for an insurance
and indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the
Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to
and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate to the intended
beneficiaries thereof than the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance policy; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Company be required to pay an annual premium in the aggregate more
than an amount equal to 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company
for such DandO Insurance. If the Company and the Surviving Company for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policy as of the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (and for so long thereafter
as any claims brought before the end of such six-year period thereunder are
being adjudicated) the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period (and
for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six-year
period thereunder are being adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in no
event shall Parent or the Surviving Company be required to pay annual premiums
in the aggregate more than an amount equal to 300% of the current annual
premium paid by the Company for such DandO Insurance.

(c) _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Company, the Surviving
Partnership, Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such

 



59  consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors, assigns or transferees of
the Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership or Parent shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.09_.

 

(d) _Survival of Indemnification_. For a period of not less than six (6) years
from the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Company and the
Surviving Partnership shall provide to the Indemnified Parties the same rights
to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses as provided to the
Indemnified Parties under the provisions of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries charter, bylaws or similar organizational documents as in effect
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and the Surviving
Companys and the Surviving Partnerships charter, bylaws or
similar organizational documents shall not contain any provisions
contradictory to such rights. The contractual indemnification rights set forth
in Section 6.09(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter in existence on the date
of this Agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be assumed by the Surviving Company or
Surviving Partnership, as applicable, without any further action, and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms following
the Company Merger Effective Time.

(e) _Benefit_. The provisions of this _Section 6.09_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs, executors or administrators and his or her representatives, shall
be binding on all successors and assigns of the parties hereto and shall
not be amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Parties
(including their successors, assigns and heirs) without the consent of the
Indemnified Party (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected
thereby.

 

(f) _Non-Exclusivity_. The provisions of this _Section 6.09_ are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. Nothing
in this Agreement, including this _Section 6.09_, is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Indemnified
Parties, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for
in this _Section 6.09_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such
claims under any such policies.

SECTION 6.10 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to any Buyer Party, this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties and their
respective boards of directors (or managing members, as applicable) shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that
such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize (to
the greatest extent practicable) the effects of such Takeover Statute on the
Buyer Parties, this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



60 SECTION 6.11 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time and for a period ending
on the first anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time (the " _Benefit
Protection Period_ "), Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership, to provide (i)
base salary to each individual who is an employee of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and for such
period of time, if any, as applicable thereafter (including employees who are
not actively at work on account of illness, disability or leave of absence)
(each, a " _Company Employee_ ") at a rate that is no less favorable than the
rate of base salary provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time, (ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity to
each Company Employee that is not less favorable than the annual cash bonus
opportunity provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, and (iii) other compensation and benefits (including
long-term incentive compensation, severance benefits, paid-time off and
health insurance) to Company Employees that are substantially comparable, in
the aggregate, to the other compensation and benefits provided to Company
Employees immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.11(a)_, from and after the
Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause Parents
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership,
to, assume, honor and continue all of the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries employment, severance, retention and termination plans,
policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including any change in
control or severance agreement between the Company or any Company Subsidiary
and any Company Employee), in each case, in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, including with
respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in
combination with any other event).

(c) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits,
vesting (if applicable) and entitlement to benefits (but not for accrual of
or entitlement to defined benefit pension benefits, post-employment welfare
benefits, special or early retirement programs, window separation programs, or
similar plans which may be in effect from time to time) under any "employee
benefit plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, but without
regard to whether the applicable plan is subject to ERISA) and any other
employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and the Surviving
Partnership, including any vacation, paid time off and severance plans, each
Company Employees service with or otherwise credited by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.
Parent shall take all necessary action so that each Company Employee shall
after the Company Merger Effective Time continue to be credited with the
unused vacation and sick leave credited to such employee through the Company
Merger Effective Time under the applicable vacation and sick leave policies of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and Parent shall permit or cause its
Subsidiaries to permit such employees to use such vacation and sick leave in
accordance with such policies.

 



61 (d) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Company and the Surviving Partnership, to waive, or cause to be waived, any
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements
and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and the Surviving
Partnership, in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will
be eligible to participate from and after the Company Merger Effective Time,
except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have
been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and the Surviving
Partnership, to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all
co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Company Merger Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such
years deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which such Company Employee (and dependents) will be
eligible to participate from and after the Company Merger Effective Time.
Parent shall provide, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Company or the Surviving Partnership to provide, notices and
continuation coverage for each Company Employee and each spouse or dependent
of a Company Employee who is an "MandA Qualified Beneficiary" (as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9) as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) If the Company Merger Effective Time occurs prior to the date on which the
Company pays annual bonuses for the 2015 performance year, then immediately
following the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall pay a bonus
(which may be prorated as set forth below) to each employee of the Company or
a Company Subsidiary who is otherwise eligible to receive such a bonus (a "
_Bonus Recipient_ ") for 2015 (the " _2015 Bonus_ "). The amount of any such
2015 Bonus initially shall be calculated (i) with respect to quantitative
performance, based on the actual performance of the Company through the
Company Merger Effective Time (or, if earlier, December 31, 2015) and, to the
extent applicable, the forecasted performance of the Company through December
31, 2015, as determined by the Companys board of directors, in good faith
and consistent with the terms and conditions of the applicable 2015 Bonus
terms and (ii) with respect to qualitative performance, assuming maximum
performance, with such amounts in (i) and (ii) prorated to reflect the
portion of the 2015 performance year completed on the date of the Company
Merger Effective Time (the " _Estimated 2015 Bonus_ "). If the Companys
actual performance for the full 2015 performance year would result in any
Bonus Recipient being entitled (in the reasonable determination of Parent) to
a 2015 Bonus amount greater than such Bonus Recipients Estimated 2015 Bonus,
then the Company shall pay, no later than March 15, 2016, to each such Bonus
Recipient who is employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary on the
applicable 2015 Bonus payment date, the positive difference, if any, between
(A) the final 2015 Bonus (as prorated through the Company Merger
Effective Time) and (B) the Estimated 2015 Bonus.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein (i) shall be
treated as an amendment of or an undertaking to amend any Company Benefit
Plan or any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any

 



62  person (including, without limitation, any director, officer or employee and
any dependent or beneficiary thereof) other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, or (iii) shall obligate Parent, the
Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership or any of their affiliates to (A)
maintain any particular benefit plan or level of benefit or (B) retain the
employment (or a particular term or condition of employment) of any
particular employee.

SECTION 6.12 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such expense. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company or the Surviving Partnership to, pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the transactions
contemplated in _Article II_.

 

SECTION 6.13 _Transfer and Gains Taxes_. The Buyer Parties shall, with the
Companys good faith cooperation and assistance, prepare, execute and file,
or cause to be prepared, executed and filed, all Tax returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes which,
in each case, become payable by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
connection with any transaction contemplated by this Agreement (together, with
any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax, the " _Transfer and
Gains Taxes_ "). From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Buyer
Parties shall pay or cause to be paid all such Transfer and Gains Taxes
without deductions withheld from any amounts payable to the holders of the
shares of Company Commons Stock or the Membership Units. The Company and
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other
to minimize such Transfer and Gains Taxes.

SECTION 6.14 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
the Company may take such further actions, if any, as may be necessary or
appropriate to ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who
is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act are exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 6.15 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent of any litigation commenced against it or any of its directors,
officers or affiliates, relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Mergers) and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give the Buyer
Parties the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
such litigation. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of the
Company Subsidiaries nor any of their Representatives to compromise or settle
regarding any such stockholder litigation unless Parent shall otherwise
consent in writing (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

SECTION 6.16 _Other Transactions_. Parent shall have the option, in its sole
discretion and without requiring the further consent of any of the Company,
the Companys board of directors or any board of trustees, board of directors,
stockholders, members or partners of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, upon reasonable notice to the Company, to 

 



63  request that the Company, immediately prior to the Closing, (a) convert or
cause the conversion of one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries that are
organized as corporations into limited liability companies and one or more
Subsidiaries that are organized as limited partnerships into limited liability
companies, on the basis of organizational documents as reasonably requested by
Parent, (b) sell or cause to be sold stock, partnership interests, limited
liability company interests or other equity interests owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company in one or more wholly-owned Company Subsidiaries at
a price and on such other terms as designated by Parent, and (c) sell or
cause to be sold any of the assets of the Company or one or more wholly-owned
Company Subsidiaries at a price and on such other terms as designated by
Parent or exercise any right of the Company or a Company Subsidiary to
terminate or cause to be terminated any Contract to which the Company or a
Company Subsidiary is a party; _provided_ , that (i) neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action in
contravention of any organizational document of the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any Company Material Contract, (ii) any such actions
or transactions shall be contingent upon all of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ having been satisfied (or, with respect to _Section 7.02_,
waived) and receipt by the Company of a written notice from Parent to such
effect and that the Buyer Parties are prepared to proceed immediately with the
Closing and any other evidence reasonably requested by the Company that the
Closing will occur (it being understood that in any event the transactions
described in clauses (a), (b) and (c) will be deemed to have occurred prior to
the Closing), (iii) such actions (or the inability to complete such actions)
shall not affect or modify in any respect the obligations of the Buyer Parties
under this Agreement, including payment of the Merger Consideration, (iv)
neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to
take any such action that could adversely affect the classification of the
Company as a REIT or could subject the Company to any "prohibited
transactions" taxes or other material Taxes under Code Sections 857(b),
860(c) or 4981 and (v) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be
required to take any such action that could result in any United States
federal, state or local income Tax being imposed on the non-managing members
of the Operating Partnership. Such actions or transactions shall be
undertaken in the manner (including in the order) specified by Parent which
actions or transactions shall be implemented immediately prior to or
concurrent with the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the
representations, warranties or covenants of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by,
any of the transactions contemplated by this  _Section 6.16_ or required by
Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.16_. Parent shall, promptly upon request
by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in performing their
obligations under this _Section 6.16_, and Parent shall indemnify the Company
for any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries arising therefrom (and in the event the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated, Parent shall reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-
pocket costs not previously reimbursed).

void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Buyer
Parties, the Parent Parties or the Company Parties or their respective
Representatives, in either case, relating to, based on or arising under or
out of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the subject
matter hereof (including the negotiation and performance of this Agreement),
in each case whether based on contract, tort, equity or strict liability, by
the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any Laws or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing
of the corporate veil, by or through any claim by or on behalf of a party
hereto or another person or otherwise, except (i) with respect to the last
two sentences of _Section 6.07(b)_, the last two sentences of _Section
6.07(d)_, _Section 6.12_, the last sentence of _Section 6.16_, this 
_Section 8.02_ and _Article IX_ (and such provisions shall remain in full
force and effect following such termination), (ii) the Guaranty and the
Confidentiality Agreement (provided that with respect to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Buyer Parties shall each be treated as if they
were a party thereto to the same extent as Blackstone Real Estate Advisors
L.P.) each continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms and (iii) subject to  _Section 8.02(d)_ and _Section
9.12_, with respect to any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a
party as a result of the willful and material breach by another party of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by (A) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_ or (B) the Company pursuant
to _Section 8.01(f)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee,
within two (2) Business Days following the date of such termination by Parent
pursuant to _clause (A)_ , or prior to or concurrently with such termination
by the Company pursuant to _clause (B_ ), the Company Termination Fee;

(ii) (A) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)_ or 
_Section 8.01(c)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_, (B) after the
date hereof, the Company shall have received a Competing Proposal or any
person shall have publicly proposed or publicly disclosed an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Competing Proposal (and in
the

 



68  case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_, such Competing
Proposal or publicly proposed or publicly disclosed intention shall have been
made prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting), and (C) within twelve (12)
months after the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall have entered
into a definitive agreement with respect to any Competing Proposal or any
Competing Proposal is consummated, then the Company shall pay to Parent or
its designee, within two (2) Business Days after the earlier of entering into
a definitive agreement with respect to a Competing Proposal or the
consummation of such Competing Proposal, the Company Termination Fee (less
any amounts already paid pursuant to _Section 8.02(b)(iv)_); _provided_ that
for purposes of this _Section 8.02(b)(ii)_, the term "Competing Proposal"
shall have the meaning assigned to such term, except that all percentages
therein shall be changed to "fifty percent (50%)";

(iii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(h)_ or _Section 8.01(i)_,
then Parent shall promptly pay to the Company or its designee, within two (2)
Business Days following the date of such termination, the Parent Termination
Fee; or

 

(iv) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_, then the
Company shall promptly pay to Parent or its designee, within two (2) Business
Days following the date of such termination, all of the documented reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred prior to the termination of this
Agreement by or on behalf of the Buyer Parties (or their affiliates) in
connection this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
any Debt Financing), including reasonable fees and expenses of the
Representatives of the Buyer Parties, up to an aggregate maximum amount of
$5,000,000. 

(c) In the event that Parent is obligated to pay to the Company the Parent
Termination Fee, Parent shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to
the Parent Termination Fee with an escrow agent reasonably selected by the
Company, after reasonable consultation with Parent, and pursuant to a written
escrow agreement (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") reflecting the terms set forth
in this _Section 8.02(c)_ and otherwise reasonably acceptable to each of the
Company and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.02(c)_ shall be made by Parent
promptly after receipt of notice from the Company that the Escrow Agreement
has been executed by the parties thereto. The Escrow Agreement shall provide
that the Parent Termination Fee in escrow or the applicable portion thereof
shall be released to the Company on an annual basis based upon the delivery
by the Company to the escrow agent of any one (or a combination) of the
following:

 

(i) a letter from the Companys independent certified public accountants
indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the
Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the applicable taxable year of the
Company determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code
(such income, " _Qualifying REIT Income_ "), in which case the escrow agent
shall release to the Company such maximum amount stated in the accountants
letter;

(ii) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company received
a private letter ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Company
of the Parent Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying REIT Income
or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release
to the Company the remainder of the Parent Termination Fee; or

 



69 (iii) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company has
received a tax opinion from the Companys outside counsel or accountant,
respectively, to the effect that the receipt by the Company of the Parent
Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying REIT Income or would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release to the Company the
remainder of the Parent Termination Fee.

 

Parent agrees to cooperate in good faith to amend this _Section 8.02(c)_ at
the reasonable request of the Company in order to (A) maximize the portion of
the Parent Termination Fee that may be distributed to the Company hereunder
without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (B) improve the Companys chances of securing
the favorable private letter ruling from the IRS described in this _Section
8.02(c)_ or (C) assist the Company in obtaining the favorable tax opinion from
its outside counsel or accountant described in this  _Section 8.02(c)_. The
Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Company shall bear all costs and
expenses under the Escrow Agreement and that any portion of the Parent
Termination Fee held in escrow for ten (10) years shall be released by the
escrow agent to Parent. Parent shall not be a party to the Escrow Agreement
and shall not bear any liability, cost or expense resulting directly or
indirectly from the Escrow Agreement (other than any Taxes of Parent
associated with the release of the funds to Parent from the escrow). The
Company shall fully indemnify Parent and hold Parent harmless from and against
any such liability, cost or expense.

 

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledge that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) without these agreements, the parties hereto would
not enter into this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be required to
pay more than one Company Termination Fee. If Parent receives the full
payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.02(b)_ under
circumstances where a Company Termination Fee was payable, the receipt by the
Parent of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive monetary remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered by the
Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Opco or any of their respective affiliates or
Representatives in connection with this Agreement (and the termination
hereof), the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination. The
parties agree that such amount is a reasonable forecast of the actual damages
which may be incurred and that such payment shall constitute liquidated
damages and not a penalty. In the event that Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, is required to commence litigation to seek all or a portion of
the amounts payable under this _Section 8.02_, and it prevails in such
litigation, it shall be entitled to receive, in addition to all amounts that
it is otherwise entitled to receive under this _Section 8.02_, all reasonable
expenses (including attorneys fees) which it has incurred in enforcing its
rights hereunder.

SECTION 8.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors or
other governing bodies at any time prior to the Company Merger Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, no amendment or waiver may be made which, by

 



70  Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires
further approval by the Companys stockholders without obtaining such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

SECTION 8.04 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time, the Buyer Parties, on the one hand, and the Company Parties, on the
other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive any breach or inaccuracy of
the representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) subject to Section 8.03, waive
compliance by the other with any of the covenants or conditions
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

SECTION 9.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are

the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders, Parent may designate, by
written notice of the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary to be a party to the Company Merger in lieu of Merger Sub, in which
event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such
other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such
designation shall not impede or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Any assignment or transfer in violation of the
preceding sentence shall be void.

 

SECTION 9.06 _Parties in Interest_. Except for: (a) _Article III_ , with
respect to the rights of holders of Shares and Membership Units to receive

entitled to such payment thereunder, and (b) _Section 6.09_, which shall be
for the benefit of each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs, executors or
administrators and his or her representatives, each of which is hereby
intended to be an express third party beneficiary thereof, the Buyer Parties
and the Company Parties hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the
terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not,
confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including, the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the rights
of third party beneficiaries under _Article III_ and _Section 6.09_ shall

representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

SECTION 9.07 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation; Headings_. Each party hereto
has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party
acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If
an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of

genders; (c) the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter
genders; and (d) the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine

this Agreement and the Annexes and Exhibits to this Agreement. All references

SECTION 9.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without

SECTION 9.09 _Venue_. Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any other party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, any state or federal court in the State of
Delaware, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to
its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of the parties agrees not to commence any action,
suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the courts described above in

any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as
described herein. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided
herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties further
waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for any
reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i)
the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts.

 

SECTION 9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial and Certain Damages_. EACH PARTY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR

 



74  OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
9.10_.

 

SECTION 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by
electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 9.12 _Specific Performance; Remedies_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or
were threatened to be not performed, by the Company or the Operating
Partnership in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Buyer
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
by the Company or the Operating Partnership and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which the Buyer Parties are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Company
and the Operating Partnership further agrees not to assert that a remedy of
specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable
for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide
an adequate remedy. Each of the Company and the Operating Partnership hereby
waives any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the
defense that a remedy at Law would be adequate. The parties hereto agree that
neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership shall be entitled to an
injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub or
Merger Opco or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement or any other equitable relief and that the Companys and the
Operating Partnerships sole and exclusive remedy relating to a breach of this
Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Opco or otherwise shall be the
remedy set forth in _Section 8.02(b)(iii)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any breach
by a Buyer Party of the second sentence of _Section 6.05_. 

(b) The parties further agree (i) the seeking of remedies pursuant to _Section
9.12(a)_ shall not in any respect constitute a waiver by any Buyer Party
seeking such remedies of its respective right to seek any other form of relief
that may be available to it under this Agreement, including under _Section
8.02_, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event
that the remedies provided for in _Section 9.12(a)_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted, (ii) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall
require a Buyer Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit a Buyer
Partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section 9.12_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article VIII_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall
the commencement of any legal proceeding by a Buyer Party seeking remedies
pursuant to _Section 9.12(a)_ or

 



75  anything set forth in this _Section 9.12_ restrict or limit Parents right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VIII_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter and (iii) each of the Company and the Operating Partnership hereby
waives any requirement for the Buyer Parties to post any bond or other
security as a condition to institute any proceeding for specific performance
under _Section 9.12(a)_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum
aggregate liability of the Buyer Parties for any losses, damages, costs or
expenses of the Company Parties or its affiliates relating to the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, or
a breach of this Agreement by the Buyer Parties, shall be limited to an
amount equal to (x) $400,000,000, plus (y) the Parents indemnification and
reimbursement obligations pursuant to the last two sentences of  _Section
6.07(b)_, the last two sentences of _Section 6.07(d)_, the last sentence of
_Section 6.16_ and the last sentence of _Section 8.02(d)_ (collectively, the
" _Liability Limitation_ "), and in no event shall the Company Parties or any
of their affiliates seek any amount in excess of the Liability Limitation in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise.

 

(d) Each of the Company Parties agrees that it has no right of recovery
against, and no personal liability shall attach to, any of the Parent Parties
(other than Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Opco to the extent provided in this
Agreement and Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P. to the extent provided in
the Confidentiality Agreement), through Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Opco or
otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited
partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Opco against any Parent Party, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any applicable Law, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, except
for its rights to recover from the Guarantor (but not any other Parent Party)
under and to the extent provided in the Guaranty and subject to the Liability
Limitation and the other limitations described therein. Recourse against the
Guarantor under the Guaranty shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company, the Operating Partnership and their respective affiliates against
the Guarantor and any other Parent Party (other than Parent, Merger Sub or
Merger Opco to the extent provided in this Agreement and Blackstone Real
Estate Advisors L.P. to the extent provided in the Confidentiality Agreement)
in connection with this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including any Debt Financing) or
in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of
any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
Without limiting the rights of the Company Parties against Parent, Merger Sub
or Merger Opco hereunder and Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P. under the
Confidentiality Agreement, in no event shall the Company Parties or their
affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement or the Equity
Commitment Letter against, or seek to recover damages from, any other Parent
Party (other than the Guarantor to the extent provided in the Guaranty and
subject to the Liability Limitation and the other limitations described
therein).

 



76 (e) None of the officers, directors or stockholders of the Company, the
holders of Membership Units (other than the Company or any Company
Subsidiary) or the officers, directors or managers (who are individuals) of
the Company Subsidiaries shall be personally bound or have any personal
liability hereunder. The Buyer Parties shall look solely to the assets of the
Company Parties for satisfaction of any liability of the Company Parties with
respect to this Agreement. The Buyer Parties will not seek recourse or
commence any action against any of the stockholders of the Company or
the holders of Membership Units (other than the Company or any Company
Subsidiary) or any of their personal assets, and will not commence any action
for money judgments against any of the officers, directors or managers (who
are individuals) of the Company or of the Company Subsidiaries or seek
recourse against any of their personal assets, for the performance or payment
of any obligation of the Company Parties hereunder.
