Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State, in such form as required by, and
executed in accordance with, the DGCL and the DLLCA. The Subsequent Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Subsequent Certificate of Merger is
duly filed with the Secretary of State on the Closing Date or at such other
time as CME and GFI shall agree and specify in the Subsequent Certificate of
Merger.

 



       
 

 



 

As used herein, the " _Subsequent Effective Time_ " shall mean the time at
which the Subsequent Merger shall become effective. Subject to the provisions
of this Agreement, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by CME and GFI, CME
and GFI shall cause the Effective Time to occur on the fifth Business Day
after all of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have been fulfilled or
waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions).

 



 

Section 1.5 _Surviving Company Constituent Documents_.

 



 

(a) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of GFI, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed
or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) The certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of
Merger Sub 2, as in effect immediately prior to the Subsequent Effective Time,
shall be the certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement,
respectively, of the Surviving Company, until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Surviving Company Managers and Officers_. The managers and
officers of Merger Sub 2 in office immediately prior to the Subsequent
Effective Time shall be the initial managers and officers of the Surviving
Company and shall hold office from the Subsequent Effective Time until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate
of formation and limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company
or otherwise as provided by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub 1 issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Common
Stock_ ") and shall constitute the only Surviving Corporation Common Stock.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of this _Article I_ and
_Article II_, each share of GFI Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of GFI Common Stock
owned by CME (including pursuant to the JPI Mergers) or GFI or any of their
respective wholly-owned subsidiaries) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and
shall thereafter represent the right to receive a fraction of a share of CME
Class A Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, subject to adjustment in
accordance with _Section 1.7(d)_ (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The "
_Exchange Ratio_ " means a fraction, the numerator of which equals the Per
Share Price and the denominator of which equals the average of the closing
sale prices of CME Class A Common Stock as reported on NASDAQ for the ten
trading days ending upon and including the trading day immediately before the
Closing Date (the " _Average Closing CME Stock Price_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

The " _Per Share Price_ " means $4.55. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event will the aggregate number of
shares of CME Class A Common Stock issuable in the Transactions exceed 19.9%
of the number of shares of CME Class A Common Stock outstanding on the trading
day immediately before the date hereof (as appropriately adjusted for any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon).

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, none of the GFI Common Stock converted
into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall remain
outstanding and all such shares of GFI Common Stock shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate previously representing any such GFI Common Stock or shares of GFI
Common Stock that are in non-certificated book-entry form (either case being
referred to in this Agreement, to the extent applicable, as a " _Certificate_
") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities,
except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any cash to be
paid in lieu of any fractional share of CME Class A Common Stock in accordance
with _Section 2.5_ (No Fractional Shares) and (iii) any dividends and other
distributions in accordance with _Section 2.1(f)_ (Dividends and
Distributions).

 



 

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of CME Class A Common
Stock shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend thereon, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items,
as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of
GFI Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event.

 



 

(e) At the Effective Time, all shares of GFI Common Stock that are owned by
CME (including pursuant to the JPI Mergers) or GFI or any of their respective
wholly-owned Subsidiaries as treasury shares or otherwise shall be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist and no Securities of CME, cash or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(f) At the Subsequent Effective Time, all limited liability company interests
of Merger Sub 2 issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Subsequent
Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist. At the
Subsequent Effective Time, each share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Subsequent Effective Time
shall be converted into one limited liability company interest of the
Surviving Company and shall constitute the only limited liability company
interests of the Surviving Company.

 



 

Section 1.8 _Continuing Employee RSUs_. Not later than five Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, GFI shall take all actions necessary to provide
that each Continuing Employee RSU outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time (a) shall cease, at the Effective Time, to represent an Equity Right with
respect to shares of GFI Common Stock and (b) as directed by CME not less than
ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, shall be converted at the
Effective Time, without any action on the part of the holder of the Continuing
Employee RSU, into either (i) an Equity Right consisting of, based on or
relating to shares of CME Class A Common Stock (each, a " _CME RSU_ ") that
may be settled in CMEs discretion in either cash or shares of CME Class A
Common Stock, (ii) a deferred cash obligation or (iii) a mix thereof, in each
case otherwise on substantially the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Continuing Employee RSU (but taking into account any
changes thereto, including any acceleration or vesting thereof, provided for
in the relevant GFI Stock Plan or in the related award document by reason of
the Transactions).

 



      
 

 



 

To the extent the Continuing Employee RSUs are converted into CME RSUs in
accordance with the preceding sentence, the number of shares of CME Class A
Common Stock subject to each such CME RSU shall be equal to the product of (i)
the number of shares of GFI Common Stock subject to the Continuing Employee
RSU _multiplied_ by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (subject to adjustment in
accordance with _Section 1.7(d)_ (Effect on Capital Stock)), rounded down to
the nearest whole share of CME Class A Common Stock, and to the extent the CME
RSU shall be settled in shares of CME Class A Common Stock, CME shall reserve
for future issuance a number of shares of CME Class A Common Stock at least
equal to the number of shares of CME Class A Common Stock that will be subject
to CME RSUs as a result of the actions contemplated by this _Section 1.8_,
and as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, CME shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with
respect to the shares of CME Class A Common Stock subject to such CME RSUs and
shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such CME RSUs remain
outstanding.

 



 

Section 1.9 _Appraisal Rights_. No right to fair value or appraisal,
dissenters or similar rights shall be available to holders of GFI Common
Stock with respect to the Merger.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **EXCHANGE OF SHARES**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Surrender and Payment_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, CME shall appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to GFI (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of
exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration. As promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than
five Business Days following the Effective Time, CME will send, or will cause
the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of GFI Common
Stock as of the Effective Time, whose shares of GFI Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 1.7_ (Effect on Capital Stock), a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent) in such form as GFI and CME
may reasonably agree, including instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration. At or prior to
the Effective Time, CME shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent,
for the benefit of the holders of shares of GFI Common Stock, shares of CME
Class A Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form) and
an amount of cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to be issued and paid pursuant to
_Section 1.7_ (Effect on Capital Stock) and _Section 2.5_ (No Fractional
Shares), payable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_
and this _Article II_.

 



      
 

 



 

Following the Effective Time, CME agrees to make available to the Exchange
Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.1(f)_ (Dividends and
Distributions). All cash and book-entry shares representing CME Class A Common
Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section 1.7_ (Effect on
Capital Stock) and _Section 2.5_ (No Fractional Shares) out of the Exchange
Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange
Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by CME
in short-term direct obligations of the U.S. or short-term obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the U.S. is pledged to provide for payment
of all principal and interest (or funds that invest in such obligations);
_provided_ that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
the holders of GFI Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement. If for any reason
(including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange
Agent hereunder, CME shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an
amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to
fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and paid to, CME.
CME shall be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(b) Each holder of shares of GFI Common Stock that have been converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange
Agent of a Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof),
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the number of shares of CME Class
A Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a
physical certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares of CME Class A Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the
right to receive and/or (ii) a check in the amount, if any, that such holder
has the right to receive, including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 2.5_ (No Fractional Shares) and dividends and other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(f)_ (Dividends and
Distributions) (less any required Tax withholding), in each case pursuant to
_Section 1.7_ (Effect on Capital Stock) and this _Article II_. The Merger
Consideration shall be paid as promptly as practicable after receipt by the
Exchange Agent of the Certificate and letter of transmittal in accordance with
the foregoing. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or unpaid dividends and
distributions payable to holders of Certificates. Until so surrendered, each
such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions.

 



 

(c) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of such
cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered
Certificate or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other than the
Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar
Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of GFI Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates representing shares of GFI Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of GFI Common Stock except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent or CME, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth, in _Article I_ and this _Article II_.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of GFI Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned
to CME, and any such holder who has not exchanged his or her shares of GFI
Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section
2.1_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to CME, and CME shall
remain liable, for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such
holders shares of GFI Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
CME, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, nor GFI shall be liable to any holder of
shares of GFI Common Stock for any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares or unpaid dividends and distributions delivered to any
Governmental Entity pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or unpaid dividends and
distributions remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of GFI Common Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of CME free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of CME Class A
Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as provided
in this _Section 2.1_. Following such surrender, subject to the effect of
escheat (in accordance with _Section 2.1(e)_), Tax or other applicable Law,
there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the shares of
CME Class A Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such
surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such
shares of CME Class A Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not
previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such shares of CME Class A Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions
in respect of shares of CME Class A Common Stock, all shares of CME Class A
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to
dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.2 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if reasonably required by CME, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of GFI Common Stock
represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article II_.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Withholding Rights_. Each of CME and the Surviving Company shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity or Taxing
Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of GFI Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Further Assurances_. If after the Effective Time, GFI or CME
reasonably believes or is advised that any further instruments, deeds,
assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate
the Combination or to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement
after the Effective Time, then GFI, CME, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Company and their respective officers and directors shall execute
and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds, assignments and assurances and
do all things reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Combination
and to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.5 _No Fractional Shares_.

 



 

(a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of CME Class A
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, no
dividends or other distributions of CME shall relate to such fractional share
interests and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of CME.

 



 

(b) In lieu of such fractional share interests, CME or the Exchange Agent
shall pay to each holder of a Certificate an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which
such holder (after taking into account all shares of GFI Common Stock formerly
represented by all Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) surrendered by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the
Average Closing CME Stock Price.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

deemed disclosure with respect to any other Section or Subsection to which the

by any federal, state or foreign securities Laws. All of such Securities have
been duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and, where applicable, are

necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the Transactions.

consolidated financial position of CME and the CME Subsidiaries as at the
respective dates thereof, and the consolidated statements of income,
consolidated statements of stockholders equity and consolidated statements of

time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading or (b) the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will, on the date it is first mailed to the stockholders
of GFI and at the time of the GFI Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. No
representation or warranty is made by CME with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference in the foregoing documents based on information

Transactions), and (b) there has not been a CME Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Proceeding
pending, threatened in writing or, to the Knowledge of CME, threatened against
CME or any CME Subsidiary, which would reasonably be expected to restrain,
enjoin or delay the consummation of any of the Transactions, and no injunction
of any type has been entered or issued.

 



 

Section 4.9 _Operations of Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2_. Merger Sub 1 and
Merger Sub 2 have been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
Transactions and prior to the Effective Time and Subsequent Effective Time, as
applicable, will have engaged in no other business activities and will have
incurred no liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated herein or
pursuant to the Transactions.

creditors rights and to general equity principles.

(it being understood that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Board
of Directors of GFI to the holders of GFI Common Stock pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not constitute a Change in
Recommendation); _provided_ that the Board of Directors of GFI (upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) may make a Change in Recommendation
pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_ (No Solicitation).

to the confidentiality agreement, dated as of October 2, 2013, by and between
GFI and CME (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). No investigation pursuant
to this _Section 6.3_ shall affect the representations, warranties or
conditions to the obligations of the Parties contained herein.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Consents and Approvals; Pre-Closing Reorganization_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of CME and GFI
will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law to consummate the Transactions, including
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents necessary and
appropriate to consummate the Transactions. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each of CME and GFI shall (i) make or cause to be
made the filings required of such party under the HSR Act and the Foreign
Competition Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date
with any request under the HSR Act for additional information, documents or
other materials received by such party from the Federal Trade Commission ("
_FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "
_Antitrust Division_ ") or by any other Governmental Entity (including under
any Foreign Competition Laws) in respect of such filings or such Transaction
and (iii) act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other Party in
connection with any such filings and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of any such agency or other Governmental Entity
under any of the HSR Act, the Foreign Competition Laws, the Sherman Act, the
Clayton Act and any other Laws or Orders that are designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade (collectively, the " _Antitrust Laws_ ") with respect to
any such filing or any such Transaction. To the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law, the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to furnish to
each other all information required for any application or other filing to be
made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the Transactions. Each
Party shall give each other reasonable prior notice of any substantive
communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement
with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such filings or any such
Transaction. No Party shall independently participate in any meeting, or
engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving the
other Parties prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless
prohibited by such any Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend or
participate. The Parties contemplate that as a general matter both CME and GFI
shall be represented at in-person meetings with any Governmental Entity. The
Parties will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection
with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act, the Foreign Competition
Laws or other Antitrust Laws.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Without limiting the general obligations of CME and GFI under _Section
6.4(a)_ (Consents and Approvals), each of CME and GFI shall use its reasonable
best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions under the Antitrust Laws.
In connection therewith and subject to _Section 6.4(a)_ (Consents and
Approvals), if any Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any Transaction as inconsistent with or violative of any Antitrust
Law, each of CME and GFI shall cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts
vigorously to contest and resist (by negotiation, litigation or otherwise) any
such Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts consummation of the Transactions,
unless CME reasonably and in good faith determines that litigation is not in
its best interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 6.4(b)_ shall limit the right of a
Party to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ (Termination), so
long as such Party has until that time complied in all material respects with
its obligations under this _Section 6.4_. Each of CME and GFI shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods or to obtain the necessary approvals under
the HSR Act, the Foreign Competition Laws or any other Antitrust Laws with
respect to the Transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to require CME or any CME Subsidiary to agree
to or take any action that would result in any Burdensome Condition. None of
GFI or any GFI Subsidiary shall agree to or take any action that would result
in any Burdensome Condition without the prior written consent of CME. For
purposes of this Agreement, a " _Burdensome Condition_ " shall mean making
proposals, executing or carrying out agreements (including consent decrees) or
submitting to Laws (i) providing for the transfer, license, sale or other
disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of CME, GFI or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or the holding separate (through the establishment of
a trust or otherwise) of the Securities of any CME Subsidiary or GFI
Subsidiary or (ii) imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on the ability
of CME, GFI or any of their respective Subsidiaries to conduct their
respective businesses (including with respect to market practices and
structure) or own such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of
ownership of the business of GFI, the GFI Subsidiaries, CME or the CME
Subsidiaries, in each case other than (x) with respect to Antitrust Laws, any
such proposals, executing or carrying out agreements (including consent
decrees) or submitting to Laws that would not impair in any material respect
the expected benefits of CME and the CME Subsidiaries from or relating to the
Transactions, or (y) with respect to Regulatory Approvals, any de minimis
administrative or ministerial obligations of CME or any CME Subsidiary, other
than, with respect to the IDB Business or IDB Subsidiaries, any such
obligation that would exist following the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) GFI shall take all steps necessary to complete the Pre-Closing
Reorganization prior to the Closing. All definitive documentation to implement
the Pre-Closing Reorganization shall be subject to CMEs reasonable prior
review and written approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.5 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.5_, GFI shall not, nor
shall it authorize or permit any of the GFI Subsidiaries or any of its and its
Subsidiaries respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiry or the
making of any proposal that constitutes a Takeover Proposal, (ii) adopt, or
publicly propose to adopt, or allow GFI or any GFI Subsidiary to execute or
enter into, any binding or non-binding letter of intent, agreement in
principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other agreement, commitment, arrangement, undertaking, or understanding in
connection with or relating to any Takeover Proposal (other than
confidentiality agreements permitted under _Section 6.5(b)(i)_) or (iii)
other than with CME, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 or their respective
Representatives or other than informing third parties of the existence of this
_Section 6.5_, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information or data in
connection with or relating to, any Takeover Proposal. GFI shall, and GFI
shall cause the GFI Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons or their Representatives
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Takeover
Proposal and shall request the prompt return or destruction of any
confidential information previously furnished to such Persons in connection
therewith in accordance with the terms of any applicable confidentiality
agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to receipt of the GFI Stockholder
Approval, GFI and the Board of Directors of GFI (upon the recommendation of
the Special Committee) may (directly or through their Representatives), in
response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that was first received
after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
_Section 6.5_, and subject to compliance with _Section 6.5(d)_ (Change in
Recommendation):

 



 

(i) furnish information with respect to GFI and the GFI Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to and
in accordance with a confidentiality agreement containing provisions no less
favorable in the aggregate to GFI than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement then in effect; _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement (A)
shall be provided to CME promptly after its execution, (B) shall not contain
any provisions that would prevent GFI from complying with its obligation to
provide the required disclosure to CME pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ (No
Solicitation) and (C) need not contain a standstill or similar provision that
prohibits such Person from making a Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _further_
, that a copy of all such information provided to such Person has previously
been provided to CME or its Representatives or is provided to CME
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person; and

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person or its
Representatives regarding such Takeover Proposal;

 



 

 _provided_ , in each case, that the Board of Directors of GFI (upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its independent financial
advisor) that such Takeover Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the receipt, directly or
indirectly, by GFI of any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to, or
that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, and in
any case within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, GFI shall provide oral and
written notice to CME of (i) such Takeover Proposal or inquiry, (ii) the
identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (iii)
the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry
(including a copy of any such written Takeover Proposal and any amendments or
modifications thereto). Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred
to above and continuing until such Takeover Proposal is withdrawn or the Board
of Directors of GFI (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) has
provided written notice to CME that it is prepared to effect a Change in
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_ (Change in Recommendation), (A)
once, and not more than once, each day at mutually reasonably agreeable times,
GFI (or its outside legal counsel) shall, in person or by telephone, provide
CME (or its outside legal counsel) a summary of the status of such Takeover
Proposal and the material resolved or unresolved issues (including the stated
positions of the parties to such negotiations on such issues) related thereto,
including material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other
material terms of such Takeover Proposal and (B) GFI shall, promptly upon
receipt or delivery thereof, provide CME (or its outside legal counsel) with
copies of all drafts and final versions (and any comments thereon) of
agreements (including schedules and exhibits thereto) relating to such
Takeover Proposal exchanged between GFI or any of its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the person making such Takeover Proposal or any of its
Representatives, on the other hand.

 



 

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of GFI nor any committee thereof (including
the Special Committee) shall, directly or indirectly, effect a Change in
Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of
the GFI Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of GFI (upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) may, in response to a Superior
Proposal or an Intervening Event, effect a Change in Recommendation;
_provided_ that the Board of Directors of GFI (upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its independent financial advisor) that the failure
to do so would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of GFI under applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_
, that the Board of Directors of GFI may not effect such a Change in
Recommendation unless (i) the Board of Directors of GFI (upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) shall have first provided prior
written notice to CME that it is prepared to effect a Change in Recommendation
in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, which notice
shall, in the case of a Superior Proposal, attach the most current version of
any written agreement relating to the transaction that constitutes such
Superior Proposal, and, in the case of an Intervening Event, attach
information specifying such Intervening Event in reasonable detail and any
other information related thereto reasonably requested by CME, it being
understood and agreed that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of
itself, be deemed a Change in Recommendation, and (ii) CME does not make,
within four Business Days after receipt of such notice a proposal that the
Board of Directors of GFI (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its independent financial advisor) would cause the proposal previously
constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal
or obviates the need for a Change in Recommendation as a result of the
Intervening Event, as the case may be.

 



      
 

 



 

GFI agrees that, during the four Business Day period prior to its effecting a
Change in Recommendation, GFI and its Representatives shall, if requested by
CME, negotiate in good faith with CME and its Representatives (so long as CME
and its Representatives are negotiating in good faith) regarding any revisions
to the terms of the Transactions proposed by CME intended to cause such
Takeover Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or to obviate
the need for a Change in Recommendation as a result of an Intervening Event.
Any material amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal or material
change to the facts and circumstances that are the basis for such Intervening
Event occurring or arising prior to the making of a Change in Recommendation
shall require GFI to provide to CME a new notice and a new negotiation period
of two Business Days (instead of four Business Days).

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ shall prohibit GFI or the Board
of Directors of GFI (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) from
taking and disclosing any position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or making any statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act in respect of
any Takeover Proposal or making any disclosure to the stockholders of GFI if
the Board of Directors of GFI (upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be likely
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of GFI under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Board of Directors
of GFI nor any committee thereof (including the Special Committee) shall,
except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.5(d)_ (Change in Recommendation),
effect a Change in Recommendation.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" _Intervening Event_ " means a material development or change in
circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof, which was not known
or reasonably foreseeable to the Special Committee as of or prior to the date
hereof (which change or development does not relate to a Takeover Proposal),
and which becomes known to the Special Committee prior to the GFI Stockholder
Approval.

 



 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide unsolicited written Takeover
Proposal made by any party (other than CME or any CME Subsidiary) that did not
result from a breach of this _Section 6.5_, and that, if consummated, would
result in such third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such
third party and GFI, the stockholders of such third party) acquiring, directly
or indirectly, 80% of the voting power of GFIs Securities or all or
substantially all the assets of GFI and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
and that the Board of Directors of GFI (upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and its independent financial advisor) to be, if consummated, more
favorable to holders of GFI Common Stock than the Merger (taking into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement as may be proposed by CME in
response to such Superior Proposal pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_) from a
financial point of view, taking into account those factors as the Board of
Directors of GFI (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) deems to
be appropriate, including the likelihood of consummation.

 



      
 

 



 

" _Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer for a direct or indirect
(i) merger, binding share exchange, recapitalization, reorganization, scheme
of arrangement under the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006, liquidation,
dissolution, business combination or consolidation, or any similar
transaction, involving GFI or one or more of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the
acquisition or purchase, including by lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge,
transfer or other acquisition or assumption, of 20% or more of the fair value
of the assets or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
(A) GFI and its Subsidiaries, (B) the CME Retained Subsidiaries, (C) the
Trayport Business or (D) the FENICS Business, in each case taken as a whole
and in one transaction or a series of related transactions, (iii) purchase,
tender offer, exchange offer or other acquisition (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of Beneficial Ownership of
Securities representing 20% or more of the voting power of GFIs Securities,
or (iv) any transaction, or combination of transactions, similar to the
foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the term " _Takeover Proposal_ "
shall not include the Transactions.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For the one year period following the Closing Date, CME will provide, or
cause one of its Affiliates to provide, each Continuing Employee with (A) base
salary at least equal to the base salary provided to the Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (B) benefits (other than equity
compensation benefits) that, taken as a whole, are comparable in the aggregate
to those provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date.

 



 

(b) Except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits, the
Surviving Company shall recognize the service of each Continuing Employee with
GFI or its Affiliates before the Effective Time as if such service had been
performed with CME or its Affiliates (i) for all purposes under the GFI
Benefit Plans maintained by the Surviving Company or its Affiliates after the
Effective Time (to the extent such plans, programs, or agreements are
delivered to Continuing Employees), (ii) for purposes of eligibility and
vesting under any employee benefit plans and programs of the Surviving Company
or its ERISA Affiliates other than the GFI Benefit Plans (the " _Surviving
Company Plans_ ") in which the Continuing Employee participates after the
Effective Time, and (iii) for benefit accrual purposes under any Surviving
Company Plan that is a vacation or severance plan in which the Continuing
Employee participates after the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by the Surviving Company or
its Affiliates in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such conditions and
exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under the welfare
plans maintained by GFI or its Affiliates prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any
such plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, GFI and the GFI Subsidiaries, as applicable,
shall fully comply with all notice, consultation, collective bargaining or
other bargaining obligations to any labor union, labor organization, works
council or group of employees, workers and/or consultants to GFI and the GFI
Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions, including such obligations
arising in respect of the Pre-Closing Reorganization.

 



 

(e) _IDB RSUs_.

 



 

(i) _Assumption of IDB RSUs_. Not later than five Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, GFI shall take all actions necessary: (A) to provide that each
GFI Stock Option (if any) outstanding immediately before the Effective Time
(an " _IDB Option_ ") shall be canceled as of the Effective Time for no
consideration; (B) to provide that each GFI RSU outstanding immediately before
the Effective Time and then held by any Person other than a Continuing
Employee or a non-employee director of GFI (an " _IDB RSU_ ") shall be
converted into an obligation of IDB Buyer in accordance with the procedures
set forth in _Section 6.6(e)_ of the GFI Disclosure Letter, and IDB Buyer
shall be solely responsible for the withholding, payment and reporting of any
Tax arising with respect to the IDB Options and IDB RSUs, including Tax
arising upon or as a result of any conversion or cancellation or any other
taxable event with respect to the IDB RSUs and IDB Options whether before, at
or after the Effective Time, including at any time after the cancellation of
the IDB Options or conversion of the IDB RSUs; (C) to provide that neither CME
nor any Affiliate of CME shall have any liability in respect of any IDB Option
or IDB RSU, and neither CME nor any Affiliate of CME shall have any obligation
to make any reports or notifications to any relevant Taxing Authority or other
Governmental Entity in relation to the IDB Options or IDB RSUs; and (D) to
obtain, subject to _Section 6.6(e)(iii)_, the Consent (as defined below) of
each holder of an IDB RSU to the cancellation or conversion of their IDB RSUs
and a release of any claims arising in connection with such IDB RSU in favor
of CME and its Affiliates in a form and at a time reasonably acceptable to
GFI.

 



 

(ii) _Consent_. For purposes of this _Section 6.6_, "Consent" means (A)
express consent in writing, including a release of any claims arising in
connection with such IDB RSU in favor of Seller and its Affiliates, where the
holder of the IDB RSU (I) is presently employed or engaged in Australia,
China, Dubai, Israel, Japan, Philippines, Singapore or Switzerland, or, where
such express consent is not obtained by the Closing Date, then as set forth in

outstanding IDB RSUs as of the date hereof; and, in all other cases (B) the
insertion of implied consent language reasonably acceptable to CME into
documentation governing awards to be granted by IDB Buyer on the conversion of
the IDB RSUs.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) _Required Efforts to Secure Consent_. GFI must obtain Consent from every
individual described in _Section 6.6(e)(ii)(A)(II)_. For all other IDB RSUs
that are subject to an express Consent requirement under _Section
6.6(e)(ii)(A)_, GFI must use its reasonable best efforts to obtain express
consent in writing from the holder of the IDB RSU within 60 days following the
date hereof, and if not obtained during such period, prior to the Closing
Date.

 



 

(iv) _Outstanding RSUs_. No more than 60 days following the date hereof, GFI
must provide CME with, for each individual identified in _Section
6.6(e)(ii)(A)_, a complete and accurate list as of the date of delivery
identifying (A) whether the individual is described in _clause (I)_ , _(II)_
or _(III)_ of _Section 6.6(e)(ii)(A)_ (and in the case of individuals
described in _clause (I)_ , the relevant jurisdiction), (ii) the number of
shares of Genesis Common Stock subject to IDB RSUs then held by such person,
and (iii) whether Consent has then been obtained in respect of such
individual. GFI shall update such list and deliver it to CME not less
frequently than monthly thereafter.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall be treated as an
amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any employee benefit plan. Nothing in
this _Section 6.6_, express or implied, shall confer upon any current or
former employee, worker, consultant or director of GFI or a GFI Subsidiary, or
legal representative or beneficiary thereof or other person, any rights or
remedies, including any right to employment or service or continued employment
or service for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature
or kind whatsoever or a right of any employee, worker, consultant or director
or beneficiary of such person under an employee benefit plan that such
employee or beneficiary or other person would not otherwise have under the
terms of that employee benefit plan without regard to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Section 8.3(c)_
(Expense Reimbursement), whether or not the Combination is consummated, all

be paid by the Party incurring such Expenses, except with respect to Expenses
of printing and mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, all filing and other
fees paid to the SEC in connection with the Transactions and all fees
associated with the HSR Act and the Foreign Competition Laws, which shall be
borne equally by CME and GFI. As used in this Agreement, " _Expenses_ "
includes all out-of-pocket expenses (including, all fees and expenses of
counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a Party
and its Affiliates) incurred by a Party or on its behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the Transactions, including the preparation,
printing, filing and mailing, as the case may be, of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Form S-4 and any amendments or supplements thereto,

Section 6.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall indemnify
and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and
present directors and officers of GFI and anyone who becomes a director or
officer of GFI during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Closing Date (in all of their capacities) (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") for
all acts and omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the same
extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of
expenses as of the date of this Agreement by GFI pursuant to GFIs Constituent
Documents and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date
hereof with any Indemnified Persons. CME shall cause the Constituent Documents
of the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company to contain provisions
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of
director and officer liability that are no less favorable to the Indemnified
Persons with respect to acts or omission occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time than those set forth in the Constituent Documents of GFI as of
the date of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any Indemnified Persons. From and after the Effective
Time, CME shall guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving
Company to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this _Section 6.8_.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, GFI shall, or if GFI is unable to, CME shall
cause the Surviving Company as of or following the Effective Time to, purchase
a six year prepaid "tail" policy on the current policies of directors and
officers, employed lawyers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by GFI with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions) (" _D and O Insurance_"); _provided_ that GFI
shall not pay, and the Surviving Company shall not be required to pay, for
such "tail" policy more than 300% of the current annual premium paid by GFI
for such D and O Insurance. If such D and O Insurance has been obtained by GFI
prior to the Effective Time, CME shall cause such D and O Insurance to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Company. If GFI or the
Surviving Company shall for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" policy, the
Surviving Company or CME shall maintain for a period of six years after the
Effective Time such D and O Insurance ( _provided_ that the Surviving Company or
CME (or any successor) may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured); _provided_ that in no event
shall the Surviving Company or CME be required to pay in any one year more
than 300% of the current annual premium paid by GFI for such D and O Insurance;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such D and O Insurance
exceed such amount, the Surviving Company or CME shall be obligated to obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

 



 

(c) If CME, the Surviving Company or any of its or their successors or assigns
(i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or other entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of CME or the Surviving Company, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.8_.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The obligations of CME, the Surviving Company and any successors thereto
under this _Section 6.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person to whom this _Section 6.8_
applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Person (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnified Persons to whom this _Section 6.8_
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.8_).

 



 

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. CME and GFI shall develop a joint
communications plan and each Party shall (a) ensure that all of its press
releases and other public statements or communications with respect to the
Transactions shall be consistent with such joint communications plan and (b)
unless otherwise required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, consult with each
other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practicable,
otherwise making any public statement or communication with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions. In addition to the foregoing, except to the
extent disclosed in or consistent with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.1_ (Preparation and Mailing of

or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) nothing in this _Section 6.9_
shall limit GFIs or the Board of Directors of GFIs rights under _Section
6.5_, (b) GFI will no longer be required to consult with CME in connection
with any such press release or public statement if the Board of Directors of

to do so and (c) the requirements of this _Section 6.9_ shall not apply to

the Transactions in connection with any dispute between the Parties regarding
this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Notice of Certain Events_. Each of CME and GFI shall promptly
notify the other after receiving or becoming aware of (a) any written notice
from any counterparty to a GFI Contract alleging that the consent of that

any Proceeding commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against, relating to
or otherwise involving CME or any of the CME Subsidiaries or GFI or any of the
GFI Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that relates to the consummation of the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 6.10_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Listing of Shares of CME Class A Common Stock_. CME shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of CME Class A Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq, subject to

dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP.

 



 

Section 6.13 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business
combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute
or regulation is or shall become applicable to the Transactions, the Parties
shall use reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and shall otherwise
act to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the
Transactions.

 



 

Section 6.14 _Stockholder or Member Litigation_. GFI shall promptly advise CME
orally and in writing of any litigation brought by any stockholder of GFI
against GFI and/or its directors relating to this Agreement and/or the
Transactions, and shall keep CME reasonably informed regarding any such
litigation. GFI shall give CME the opportunity to consult with GFI, and shall
take into account and implement CMEs reasonable views, regarding the defense
or settlement of any such litigation and shall not settle any such litigation
without the prior written consent of CME (which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

Section 6.15 _Actions with Respect to Existing GFI Indebtedness_.

 



 

(a) GFI shall deliver to CME prior to the Closing a copy of a payoff letter,
in commercially reasonable form, under the Credit Agreement, evidencing the
amount necessary to repay or satisfy and discharge any Indebtedness
outstanding under the Credit Agreement, the termination of all agreements and
all obligations in connection therewith and the release of all Liens securing
the obligations under the Credit Agreement. At or prior to the Closing, GFI
shall pay such payoff amounts as provided in such payoff letter in order to
terminate the Credit Agreement at the Closing.

 



 

(b) At CMEs written request, GFI shall use its reasonable best efforts to
commence as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such request (or
at such later time as specified in such request) and conduct and consummate at
the time specified in such request, and on such other terms and conditions,
including pricing terms, specified by CME, an offer to purchase all or a
portion of the outstanding Senior Notes due 2018 (a " _Tender Offer_ ") and/or
a solicitation of consent of the holders of the Senior Notes due 2018 to such
amendments to the Indenture as CME may specify (a " _Consent Solicitation_ ,"
and any Tender Offer or Consent Solicitation a " _Debt Offer_ "); _provided_
that, (A) with respect to any Debt Offer, GFI shall not be required to
commence such Debt Offer until CME shall have provided GFI with the necessary
offer to purchase, consent solicitation statement, letter of transmittal,
supplemental indenture or other related documents in connection with such Debt
Offer (collectively, " _Debt Offer Documents_ ") a reasonable period of time
in advance of commencing such Debt Offer and (B) CME shall afford GFI a
reasonable opportunity to review the material terms and conditions of the Debt
Offers.

 



      
 

 



 

The closing of any Debt Offer shall be expressly conditioned on the occurrence
of the Closing (provided that, in the case of any Tender Offer that CME
requires to be conducted on such terms as would satisfy any obligation of GFI
under the terms of the Senior Notes due 2018 to repurchase Senior Notes due
2018 in connection with the occurrence of a repurchase event under the
Indenture, as provided below, the closing of such Debt Offer may be
conditioned on the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event (as
defined in the Indenture) as contemplated by the Indenture). None of the
Senior Notes due 2018 shall be required to be accepted for purchase or
purchased pursuant to a Debt Offer prior to the Closing. GFI shall, and shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, to provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by CME in connection with any Debt Offer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall (x) require such
cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the
business or operations of GFI or any of its Subsidiaries or (y) require GFI or
any of its Subsidiaries to pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs or
expenses or make any payment, prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time
(except to the extent that CME promptly reimburses (in the case of ordinary
course out-of-pocket costs and expenses) or provides the funding (in all other
cases) to GFI or such Subsidiary therefor). The closing of each Tender Offer
and each Consent Solicitation shall be conducted in compliance with applicable
Laws, including SEC rules and regulations to the extent applicable. GFI shall
waive any of the conditions to a Debt Offer (other than, to the extent
applicable to such Debt Offer, that the Merger shall have been consummated and
that there shall be no law, injunction or other legal restraint prohibiting
consummation of such Debt Offer) as may be reasonably requested by CME and
shall not, without the prior written consent of CME, waive any condition to a
Debt Offer or make any changes to a Debt Offer. Without limitation as to the
foregoing, CME may require that a Tender Offer pursuant to this _Section
6.15_ be conducted on such terms as would satisfy any obligation of GFI under
the terms of the Senior Notes due 2018 to repurchase Senior Notes due 2018 in
connection with the occurrence of a repurchase event under the Indenture. In
connection with any Consent Solicitation, if the requisite valid consents from
holders of the Senior Notes due 2018 have been received in accordance with the
Indenture and the terms of such Consent Solicitation, GFI shall use its
reasonable best efforts (including reasonable best efforts to cause its
counsel to deliver such legal opinions as are required under the Indenture) to
cause the Trustee to execute a supplemental indenture to the Indenture to
implement the amendments thereto authorized in such Consent Solicitation;
_provided_ that no such amendment shall (x) be effective until immediately
prior to the Effective Time unless the operative provisions of such
supplemental indenture would, by their terms, revert and be deemed never to
have been in effect in the event that this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with the provisions hereof or would cease to apply if the Effective
Time never occurs or (y) be operative with respect to any period prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(c) If requested by CME in writing, GFI shall take all actions requested by
CME reasonably necessary, including the issuance of one or more notices of
optional redemption for all or a portion of the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Notes due 2018 pursuant to the Indenture, in
order to effect the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture with respect
to the Senior Notes due 2018 and/or the covenant defeasance of the Senior
Notes due 2018, in each case pursuant to the Indenture (such a satisfaction
and discharge or defeasance, a " _Discharge_ " of the Senior Notes due 2018),
and shall effect such Discharge of the Senior Notes due 2018 at the Effective
Time or at such other time thereafter as may be specified by CME; _provided_
that (i) in no event shall GFI be required to consummate a Discharge of the
Senior Notes due 2018 or issue any irrevocable notice of redemption with
respect to the Senior Notes due 2018 prior to the Closing, (ii) to the extent
that a Discharge of the Senior Notes due 2018 can be conditioned on the
completion of the Merger, it will be so conditioned, (iii) prior to GFI being
required to issue any notice of redemption with respect to Senior Notes due
2018, CME shall set aside, or shall cause to be set aside, sufficient funds to
deliver to GFI to effect such redemption and (iv) prior to GFI being required
to effect a Discharge of the Senior Notes due 2018, CME shall deliver to, or
shall cause to be delivered to, GFI or a paying agent selected or approved by
CME and reasonably acceptable to GFI funds sufficient to enable GFI to effect
such Discharge of the Senior Notes due 2018.

 



      
 

 



 

GFI shall provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to provide, any other cooperation reasonably requested by CME
to facilitate any Discharge.

 



 

(d) The Debt Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements thereto)
and all other communications with the holders of the Senior Notes due 2018 in
connection with any Debt Offer or any Discharge shall be subject to prior
review of, and comment by, CME and GFI and shall be reasonably acceptable to
each of them. GFI shall not waive any condition to any Debt Offer or Discharge
other than as agreed in writing between CME and GFI. GFI shall, and shall
cause the GFI Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by CME in connection with any Debt Offer or
Discharge. Without limitation as to the foregoing, GFI and the GFI
Subsidiaries shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its counsel
to, furnish legal opinions in customary form and scope relating to GFI and the
GFI Subsidiaries, the Indenture and the Senior Notes due 2018 and the Merger
to the extent required by the Indenture in connection with any Debt Offer
(including any supplemental indentures in connection therewith) or Discharge;
_provided_ that CME will provide such assistance and information in connection
therewith as is reasonably requested by GFI. In connection with any Debt Offer
or Discharge, CME may select one or more dealer managers, information agents,
solicitation agents, tabulation agents, depositaries and other agents, in each
case reasonably acceptable to GFI, to provide assistance in connection
therewith, and GFI shall use reasonable best efforts to enter into customary
agreements with such parties so selected on terms reasonably satisfactory to
CME (any such agreement, an " _Agent Agreement_ ").

 



 

(e) GFI and CME shall keep each other reasonably informed regarding the
status, results and timing of any Debt Offer or Discharge. If, at any time
prior to the completion of any Tender Offer or Consent Solicitation, GFI, on
the one hand, or CME, on the other hand, discovers any information that should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the offer and/or consent
solicitation documents so that such documents shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, such party that
discovers such information shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by
CME describing such information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of GFI
to the holders of the Senior Notes due 2018. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.15_, GFI and CME shall comply with the
requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other Law to the
extent applicable in connection with any Tender Offer or Consent Solicitation,
and such compliance will not be deemed a breach hereof.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) Any obligation of GFI pursuant to this _Section 6.15_ to consummate any
Debt Offer, redemption or Discharge shall, in each case, be subject to CME
delivering or causing to be delivered to GFI or to the Trustee or applicable
paying agent, tender or solicitation agent, as the case may be, on or prior to
the date of such consummation, sufficient funds to consummate such Tender
Offer, Consent Solicitation, redemption or Discharge, as applicable. CME shall
pay the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any dealer manager, information
agent, solicitation agent, tabulation agent, depositary or other agent
retained in connection with the Debt Offers to the extent, in the amounts and
at the times payable pursuant to the applicable Agent Agreement. CME further
agrees to reimburse GFI and its Subsidiaries for all of their documented
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including documented reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel) in connection with the Debt Offers and the
Discharge of any Senior Notes due 2018, promptly following the incurrence
thereof and the delivery by GFI to CME of reasonably satisfactory
documentation thereof. CME shall indemnify and hold harmless GFI, IDB Buyer
and their respective Affiliates and Representatives from and against any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
awards, judgments and penalties of any type actually suffered or incurred by
any of them in connection with the Debt Offer, the Discharge of any Senior
Notes due 2018 and/or the provision of information utilized in connection
therewith (other than information provided in writing by GFI specifically for
use in connection therewith), in each case, except to the extent that any such
obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, awards, judgments and
penalties, fees, costs or other liabilities are suffered or incurred as a
result of GFIs or its Representatives gross negligence, bad faith, willful
misconduct or material breach of this Agreement, as applicable, or arise from
disclosure provided by GFI or its Representatives (including disclosures
incorporated by reference in any Debt Offer document) that contained a
material misstatement or omission.

 



 

(g) GFI shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure compliance with and
discharge of the obligations of GFI under the Indenture in accordance with the
terms thereof. Prior to the Effective Time, GFI shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take all necessary actions in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, including delivery of any supplemental indentures, legal opinions,
officers certificates or other documents or instruments, in connection with
the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(h) GFI shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with CME in maintaining and/or
seeking upgrades to the credit ratings assigned to the Senior Notes due 2018
by each Rating Agency (as defined in the Indenture), such cooperation to
include assisting with the preparation of, and furnishing such information as
CME may reasonably request for inclusion in, customary materials for rating
agency presentations and participating in a reasonable number of meetings and
sessions with each Rating Agency (as defined in the Indenture); _provided_
that nothing in this _Section 6.15(h)_ will require such cooperation to the
extent it would unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the business or
operations of GFI or any of its Subsidiaries. CME will reimburse GFI and its
Representatives for their documented reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses in connection with providing such cooperation promptly following the
incurrence thereof and the delivery by GFI to CME of reasonably satisfactory
documentation thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.16 _Tax Matters_. GFI and each GFI Subsidiary will duly and timely
file with the appropriate Governmental Entities or Taxing Authorities all Tax
Returns required to be filed by it in respect of any material Taxes in any
jurisdiction for which GFI is required by a Governmental Entity to file such
Tax Returns, including, but not limited to those Tax Returns required to be
filed in respect of all material Taxes not yet due and payable with respect to
the results of operations of GFI and each GFI Subsidiary, whether or not such
Taxes are asserted by the relevant Governmental Entity or Taxing Authority,
and such Tax Returns will be true, correct and complete in all material
respects.

 



 

Section 6.17 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Exchange Act Deregistration_. Prior to
the Closing Date, GFI shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the New
York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") to enable the delisting of GFI Common
Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of GFI Common Stock under the
Exchange Act on the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.18 _Certain Financial Information_. No later than three Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, GFI shall prepare in good faith (in
consultation with CME) and deliver to CME a certificate executed by the chief
financial officer of GFI (the " _Estimated Closing Certificate_ ") setting
forth the estimated amount as of the Closing Date, immediately following the
consummation of the Transactions and giving effect thereto, of (i) Available
Cash, (ii) Working Capital, prepared in accordance with the sample calculation
set forth in _Section 1.1(d)_ of the GFI Disclosure Letter, and (iii)
Tangible Equity (including a breakdown by type of equity, including Available

_Section 1.1(c)_ of the GFI Disclosure Letter, together with reasonable
supporting detail. The Estimated Closing Certificate shall be in the form set
forth in _Section 6.18_ of the GFI Disclosure Letter. Following delivery of
the Estimated Closing Certificate and prior to the Closing, GFI will provide
CME and its Representatives with reasonable access to the books and records,
personnel and related work papers of GFI and its Subsidiaries in connection
with CMEs review of the Estimated Closing Certificate and the information set
forth therein.

the applicable counter party thereto) without the prior written consent of the
Special Committee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

Takeover Proposal made by way of a tender offer or exchange offer, fail to
recommend that GFIs stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer
within the ten Business Day period specified in Section 14e-2(a) under the

after receipt of the GFI Stockholder Approval.

 



 

(d) by GFI, if:

 



 

(i) _Breach by CME_. CME, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 shall have breached or
failed to perform any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) is
incapable of being cured by CME, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 prior to the
Outside Date or is not cured by the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days following
written notice to CME, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 by GFI of such breach or
(y) the Outside Date and (B) would result in the failure of any condition set
forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ (Representations and Warranties) or _Section
7.3(b)_ (Performance of Obligations of CME, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2);
_provided_ that GFI is not then in breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that would result in the
failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ (Representations and
Warranties) or _Section 7.2(b)_ (Performance of Obligations of GFI) to be
satisfied; or

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) _Issuance Cap_. The aggregate number of shares of CME Class A Common
Stock issuable in the Transactions but for the last sentence of _Section
1.7(b)_ would exceed 19.9% of the number of shares of CME Class A Common Stock
outstanding on the trading day immediately before the date hereof (as
appropriately adjusted for any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend
thereon).

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_ (Termination), the obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall terminate and there shall be no liability on the part
of any Party with respect thereto, except for the confidentiality provisions
of _Section 6.3_ (Access to Information; Confidentiality) and the provisions
of this _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ (Termination Fee and Expense
Reimbursement) and _Article IX_ (General Provisions), each of which shall
remain in full force and effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall
be relieved or released from any liability or damages arising from a breach of
any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement_.

 



 

(a) If (x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i) _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_ (No Stockholder Approval), (ii) _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ (Breach by
GFI), (iii) _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ (Violation of No Solicitation) or (iv)
_Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ (Failure to Recommend or Change in Recommendation) and
(y) within twelve months of such termination, (A) GFI enters into a definitive
agreement to consummate a transaction contemplated by any Takeover Proposal
(regardless of when made and such transaction is thereafter consummated
(regardless of when consummated)) or (B) GFI consummates a transaction
contemplated by any Takeover Proposal (regardless of when made), then GFI
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to CME, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an amount equal to $20,143,121 less the amount, if any, of
the Expenses of CME paid by GFI pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_, concurrently
with the consummation of such transaction; _provided_ that, solely for
purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)_, the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have
the meaning ascribed thereto in _Section 6.5(f)_ (No Solicitation), except
that all references to 20% shall be changed to 50%.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ (No
Stockholder Approval), then GFI shall reimburse CME for all of its reasonable
and documented Expenses up to a maximum amount of $5,755,177 within five
Business Days of delivery of a reasonable detailed written notice from CME
requesting payment thereof.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_
(Termination Date), _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ (Restraint), or _Section
8.1(b)(iv)_ (Other Transactions) in connection with any failure to obtain any
required Regulatory Approval set forth in _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_ of the GFI
Disclosure Letter, then GFI shall reimburse CME for all of its reasonable
Expenses up to a maximum amount of $10 million within five Business Days of
delivery of a reasonably detailed written notice from CME requesting payment
thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) GFI agrees that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an
integral part of this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, CME would
not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if GFI fails promptly to pay any
amounts due under this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
CME commences a suit that results in a judgment against GFI for such amounts,
GFI shall pay interest on such amounts from the date the payment of such
amounts was due to the date of actual payment at the prime rate of the Bank of
New York in effect on the date such payment was due, together with the
reasonable Expenses of CME in connection with such suit.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings (including headings contained in parentheticals to
Section and Article references) contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." As it relates to GFI, the words "made available" shall
be deemed to mean that such information was (a) provided in writing to CME or
its Representatives, (b) included in GFIs electronic data room or (c) was
otherwise available in GFIs public filings on the SECs public website
(www.sec.gov); provided, that the immaterial omission of a document or part of
a document shall not mean that such information was not "made available." The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms. The Parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective when each Party shall have received counterparts
thereof signed and delivered by the other Parties. Signatures transmitted
electronically shall be accepted as originals for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement (including the Exhibits and the Parties disclosure letters
hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement, the JPI Merger Agreement, the IDB
Transaction Agreement and the GFI Support Agreement constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

 



 

(b) This Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any rights or
remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except for (i) from and after the Effective
Time, the rights of the stockholders of GFI to receive the Merger
Consideration, (ii) from and after the Effective Time, the right of the
holders of Continuing Employee RSUs to receive the CME RSUs and (iii) the
Indemnified Persons who may enforce the provisions of _Section 6.8_
(Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance). The representations
and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in
accordance with _Section 9.9_ (Extension; Waiver) without notice or liability
to any other Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Accordingly,
Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors (and in the
case of GFI, upon the recommendation thereof by the Special Committee), at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with this
Agreement by the stockholders of GFI, but, after such approval, no amendment
shall be made which by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant
stock exchange requires further approval by such stockholders without such
further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors
(and in the case of GFI, upon the recommendation thereof by the Special
Committee), may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any
of the agreements or, except as provided in _Section 7.1(a)_, conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of those rights.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN, AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN, ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS RULES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THAT WOULD
CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY STATE OTHER THAN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE. The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, in the event (but only
in the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over
such action or proceeding, the federal courts of the United States of America
located in the State of Delaware in respect of all matters arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement, and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not
to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not
subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or
is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in
or by such courts, and the Parties irrevocably agree that all claims with
respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined exclusively
in such courts.

 



      
 

 



 

The Parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the
person of such Parties solely for such purpose and over the subject matter of
such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection
with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 9.2_
(Notices) or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid
and sufficient service thereof.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 9.10(b)_.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties (on behalf of
themselves and the third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement provided in
_Section 9.5(b)_ (Third Party Beneficiaries)) shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

 

       
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, GFI, CME, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 have caused this
Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized,
all as of the date first written above.

 **Exhibit A**

 



 

 **SUPPORT AGREEMENT**

 



 

This Support Agreement, dated as of July 30, 2014 (this " _Agreement_ "), is
made and entered into by and among CME Group Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_CME_ "), Jersey Partners Inc., a New York corporation (" _JPI_ "), New JPI
Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _New JPI_ "), and each direct or indirect
stockholder of GFI Brokers Holdco Ltd, a Bermuda limited liability Company ("
_IDB Buyer_ ") (such stockholders together with JPI and New JPI, the "
_Stockholders_ "). CME and each of the Stockholders are referred to
individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_."
Capitalized terms have the meanings given to them in _Section 1.1_.

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the JPI Merger
Agreement and the IDB Transaction Agreement, GFI Group Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _GFI_ "), CME, Cheetah Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of CME (" _Merger Sub 1_ "), and
Cheetah Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of CME (" _Merger Sub 2_ "), are entering into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, the " _GFI Merger Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, among other
things, Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into GFI (the " _GFI Merger_ "),
which will then merge with and into Merger Sub 2, and each issued and
outstanding share of GFIs common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _GFI
Common Stock_ "), other than shares of GFI Common Stock owned by CME or GFI or
any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries, will, subject to the terms
and conditions of the GFI Merger Agreement, be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration;

 



 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Stockholder Beneficially Owns and owns of
record the number of shares of GFI Common Stock set forth opposite such
Stockholders name on _Schedule I_ hereto (the " _Existing Shares_ "); and

 



 

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to CMEs willingness to enter into the
GFI Merger Agreement, the JPI Merger Agreement and the IDB Transaction
Agreement, the Stockholders have agreed to enter into this Agreement.

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **DEFINITIONS**

 



 

Section 1.1 _Defined Terms_. The following terms, as used in this Agreement,
shall have the meanings specified in this _Section 1.1_. Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto
in the GFI Merger Agreement.

 



 

" _Beneficial Owner_ " means, with respect to a Security, any Person who,
directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding,
relationship or otherwise, has or shares (i) the power to vote, or to direct
the voting of, such Security or (ii) the power to dispose of, or to direct the
disposition of, such Security, and shall otherwise be interpreted in
accordance with the term "beneficial ownership" as defined in Rule 13d-3 under
the Exchange Act; _provided_ that, for purposes of determining whether a
Person is a Beneficial Owner of such Security, a Person shall be deemed to be
the Beneficial Owner of any Securities which may be acquired by such Person
pursuant to any contract, arrangement or understanding or upon the exercise of
conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise
(irrespective of whether the right to acquire such Securities is exercisable
immediately or only after the passage of time, including the passage of time
in excess of 60 days, the satisfaction of any conditions, the occurrence of
any event or any combination of the foregoing), and the terms " _Beneficially
Owned_ " and " _Beneficial Ownership_ " shall be construed accordingly.

      
 

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, CME shall not be deemed to be the Beneficial Owner
of any GFI Common Stock by virtue of this Agreement or the JPI Merger
Agreement.

 



 

" _Covered GFI Shares_ " means, with respect to each Stockholder, (1) such
Stockholders Existing Shares and (2) any shares of GFI Common Stock or other
voting capital stock of GFI and any Securities convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for shares of GFI Common Stock or other voting capital stock
of GFI, in each case that such Stockholder has Beneficial Ownership of, on or
after the date hereof; it being understood that if any Stockholder acquires
Securities (or rights with respect thereto) described in clause (2) above,
such Stockholder shall promptly notify CME in writing, indicating the number
of such Securities so acquired.

 



 

" _Transfer_ " means (a) any direct or indirect offer, sale, lease,
assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation, disposition or other transfer
(by operation of law or otherwise), either voluntary or involuntary, or entry
into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect
to any offer, sale, lease, assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation,
disposition or other transfer (by operation of law or otherwise), of any
capital stock or interest in any capital stock or (b) in respect of any
capital stock or interest in any capital stock, to enter into any swap or any
other agreement, transaction or series of transactions that hedges or
transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic
consequence of ownership of such capital stock or interest in capital stock,
whether any such swap, agreement, transaction or series of transaction is to
be settled by delivery of Securities, in cash or otherwise.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **VOTING AGREEMENT AND IRREVOCABLE PROXY**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Agreement to Vote_.

 



 

(a) Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that,
during the term of this Agreement, at the GFI Stockholders Meeting and at any
other meeting of the stockholders of GFI, however called, including any
adjournment or postponement thereof, and in connection with any written
consent of the stockholders of GFI, such Stockholder shall, in each case to
the fullest extent that the Covered GFI Shares are entitled to vote thereon or
consent thereto, or in any other circumstance in which the vote, consent or
other approval of the stockholders of GFI is sought:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause such Stockholders Covered
GFI Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a
quorum; and

 



 

(ii) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, or if applicable
deliver (or cause to be delivered) a written consent covering, all of such
Stockholders Covered GFI Shares:

 



 

(1) in favor of the approval and adoption of the GFI Merger, the GFI Merger
Agreement, the Transactions and any other action requested by CME in
furtherance thereof;

 



 

(2) in favor of any proposal to adjourn a meeting of the stockholders of GFI
to solicit additional proxies in favor of the approval and adoption of the GFI
Merger, the GFI Merger Agreement and the Transactions;

 



 

(3) against any Takeover Proposal; and

 



 

(4) against any other action, agreement or transaction that is intended to, or
could reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone,
discourage, frustrate the purposes of or adversely affect the Transactions or
the performance by GFI, JPI, New JPI or the other Stockholders of their
respective obligations pursuant to the Transactions or under this Agreement,
including: (A) any action, agreement or transaction that could reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the consummation of the Transactions
not being satisfied, or that would result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of such Person
pursuant to the Transactions or contained in this Agreement; (B) any change in
the individuals who constitute the Board of Directors of GFI, JPI or New JPI;
(C) other than the Transactions or other than as expressly contemplated by the
Transactions, any extraordinary corporate transaction, including any merger,
consolidation or other business combination involving GFI, JPI, New JPI or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, any sale, lease or transfer of a material
amount of assets of GFI, JPI, New JPI or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or any reorganization, recapitalization or liquidation of GFI, JPI, New JPI or
any of their respective Subsidiaries; or (D) other than as expressly required
pursuant to the Transactions, any change in the present capitalization or
dividend policy of GFI, JPI or New JPI or any amendment or other change to
their respective Constituent Documents.

 



 

(b) Any vote required to be cast or consent required to be executed pursuant
to this _Section 2.1_ shall be cast or executed in accordance with the
applicable procedures relating thereto so as to ensure that it is duly counted
for purposes of determining that a quorum is present (if applicable) and for
purposes of recording the results of that vote or consent. The obligations of
the Stockholders in this _Section 2.1_ shall apply whether or not the GFI
Merger or any action above is recommended by the Board of Directors of GFI (or
any committee thereof including the Special Committee).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.2 _Grant of Irrevocable Proxy_. Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably
appoints as its proxy and attorney-in-fact CME, and any other Person
designated by CME in writing (collectively, the " _Grantees_ "), each of them
individually, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to the
fullest extent of such Stockholders rights with respect to the Covered GFI
Shares, effective as of the date hereof and continuing until the Termination
Date (the " _Voting Period_ "), to vote (or execute written consents, if
applicable) with respect to the Covered GFI Shares as required pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ hereof. The proxy granted by each Stockholder hereunder shall
be irrevocable during the Voting Period, shall be deemed to be coupled with an
interest sufficient in Law to support an irrevocable proxy, and each
Stockholder (a) will take such further action or execute such other
instruments as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy and (b)
hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by such Stockholder with respect
to any Covered GFI Shares. The power of attorney granted by each Stockholder
hereunder is a durable power of attorney and shall survive the bankruptcy or
dissolution of such Stockholder. Other than as provided in this _Section
2.2_, no Stockholder shall directly or indirectly grant any Person any proxy
(revocable or irrevocable), power of attorney or other authorization with
respect to any of such Stockholders Covered GFI Shares. For Covered GFI
Shares as to which any Stockholder is the Beneficial Owner but not the holder
of record, such Stockholder shall cause any holder of record of such Covered
GFI Shares to grant to the Grantees a proxy to the same effect as that
described in this _Section 2.2_. CME may terminate this proxy with respect to
any Stockholder at any time at its sole election by written notice provided to
such Stockholder.

 **ARTICLE V**

 



 

 **TERMINATION**

 



 

Section 5.1 _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to
occur of (such date, the " _Termination Date_ "): (a) the Effective Time, (b)
the termination of this Agreement by the mutual written consent of CME and the
Stockholders, (c) a Qualifying Termination of the GFI Merger Agreement and (d)
the day that is 12 months after the date of any other termination of the GFI
Merger Agreement (the period from such termination, the " _Tail Period_ ").
For purposes of this agreement, " _Qualifying Termination_ " means a
termination of the GFI Merger Agreement (i) by GFI pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(i) of the GFI Merger Agreement or (ii) by either CME or GFI pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(b)(ii) of the GFI Merger Agreement (including
any amendments thereto) solely due to the failure by CME to obtain any
required approval for the GFI Merger under any Antitrust Law.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Tail Period_. In the event that during the Tail Period, as a
result of the financial condition of GFI and its Subsidiaries, there is, or is
reasonably likely to be, a default under either or both of (x) the Indenture
or (y) the Credit Agreement (collectively, the " _Debt Agreements_ ") that, if
not cured, would result in the relevant GFI obligor partys obligations under
one or both of such Debt Agreements to be accelerated, the obligations of the
Stockholders under this Agreement shall terminate solely to the extent
necessary to allow the Stockholders to approve the sale of all the equity of
GFI (including by merger, consolidation or other business combination) or all
or substantially all of the assets of GFI, in each case to a bona fide third-
party purchaser.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Effect of Termination._ In the event of any termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 5.1_, the obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall terminate and there shall be no liability on the part of any
Party with respect thereto, except the provisions of this _Section 5.3_ and
_Article VI_, each of which shall remain in full force and effect; provided,
however, that no Party shall be relieved or released from any liability or
damages arising from a breach of any provision of this Agreement.

connection with the GFI Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby, its identity and ownership of shares of GFI Common Stock, the nature
of its commitments, arrangements and understandings pursuant to this Agreement
and such other information required in connection with such publication or
disclosure (" _Stockholder Information_ "), and (ii) hereby agrees to
cooperate with CME in connection with such filings, including providing
Stockholder Information requested by CME. As promptly as practicable, each

Stockholder Information supplied by Stockholder, if and to the extent such
Stockholder becomes aware that any such Stockholder Information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect.

Section 6.5 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Schedule to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as drafted jointly by
the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective when each Party shall have received counterparts
thereof signed and delivered by the other Parties. Signatures transmitted
electronically shall be accepted as originals for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.7 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement (including the Schedules hereto), the Confidentiality
Agreement, the F-Reorganization Documents (as defined in the JPI Merger
Agreement), the JPI Merger Agreement, the GFI Merger Agreement and the IDB
Transaction Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 



 

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each Party, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any Person not a party to this Agreement any rights,
benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner so that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby are effected as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Extension; Waiver_. The Parties may, to the extent legally

other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN, AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS RULES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THAT WOULD
CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY STATE OTHER THAN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE.

 



      
 

 



 

The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, in the event (but only in the
event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such
action or proceeding, the federal courts of the United States of America
located in the State of Delaware in respect of all matters arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement, and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any
action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of
any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties irrevocably
agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard
and determined exclusively in such courts. The Parties hereby consent to and
grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such Parties solely for
such purpose and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 6.4_ or in such other manner as
may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 6.12(b)_.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
in equity.

 



      
 

 



 

Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

 

       
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, CME, JPI, New JPI and each other Stockholder have duly
executed this Agreement, all as of the date first written above.
