Allocation_ "). The Caesars Parties shall deliver to Growth Partners any
documentation reasonably requested by Growth Partners in connection with the
preparation of the Purchase Price Allocation. Growth Partners and CEOC shall
endeavor in good faith to agree on the Purchase Price Allocation. If Growth
Partners and CEOC have not agreed on the Purchase Price Allocation within

will be finally and conclusively resolved by an independent accounting firm of

withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as Growth Partners is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of

withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental Entity by Growth Partners,
such withheld and deducted amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the respective Seller or other Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Growth Partners.
Growth Partners shall deliver to such Seller or other Person, upon request, a
receipt or other documentation evidencing the payment of any such withheld
and deducted amounts to the appropriate Governmental Entity. If Growth

Parent and each Seller represents and warrants, jointly and severally, to
Growth Partners as follows:

Section 5.1  _Organization and Qualification_. Parent and each Seller is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization, and has all requisite corporate or
limited liability company power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its businesses as presently conducted. Parent and
each Seller is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the conduct of its business requires such
licensure or qualification except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified or in good standing has not had or would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on
the ability of Parent and each Seller to perform their respective obligations
under this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

Section 5.2 _Power and Authority; Authorization_. Parent and each Seller has
all requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the
other Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be a party, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be a party. Parents and each
Sellers execution and delivery of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement
to which it is a party and the consummation by Parent and Sellers of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been recommended by the
special committee of the Board of Directors of Parent and have been duly
authorized by all action on the part of Parent and each Seller.

 

Section 5.3 _Due Execution and Enforceability_. This Agreement and each other
Ancillary Agreement to which Parent or any Seller is or will be a party has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and such Seller, as
applicable, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and each respective Ancillary Agreement by the other
parties hereto and thereto, constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent and each Seller, as applicable, enforceable against
Parent and each Seller, as applicable, in accordance with its terms, subject
to the effect of any applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential transfers, or
similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and subject,
as to enforceability, to the effect of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at Law).

 



26 Section 5.4 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except as set forth on 
_Section 5.4_ of the Caesars Disclosure Schedule, no Consent from any
Governmental Entity is required to be made or obtained by Parent or any Seller
in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by it of its
obligations under this Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements to which
it is or will be a party, or the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, except for such Consents as may be required
under the Laws of any jurisdiction in which any Seller conducts any business
or owns any assets, the failure of which to make or obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to result in any
Company Party or its Subsidiaries incurring a material Liability or any
Company Party or its Subsidiaries being unable to conduct its respective
businesses in substantially the same manner as such business is presently
conducted. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements by Parent or any Seller nor the performance by Parent or
any Seller of its obligations nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby will (a) violate, result in a breach of, or
constitute a default under their respective Governing Documents, (b) violate,
result in a breach of, constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time
or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination, amendment,
cancellation or acceleration or result in the loss of a material benefit)
under, or require any consent or waiver under, any of the material terms,
conditions or provisions of any material Contract to which Parent or any
Seller is a party, (c) result in the creation of any Lien on any of
the Purchased Interests (other than Permitted Liens) or (d) violate or
infringe in any material respect any Law or Order applicable to Parent or any
Seller or any of the Purchased Interests.

 

Section 5.5 _Ownership; Title_.

 

(a) CEOC is the sole record and beneficial owner of all of the outstanding
equity interests in each of the Company Parties and, following
the Restructuring Transactions, each of the NewCo Sellers shall be the sole

respective Purchased Assets, free and clear of any Liens. At the Closing,
each Seller will transfer to Growth Partners or its designee good and
marketable title to its respective Purchased Assets, free and clear of any
Liens.

 

(c) No Seller is party to any option, warrant, purchase right or other
Contract (other than this Agreement) obligating such Seller to
sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of its respective Purchased
Assets. Neither CEOC nor any Seller is a party to any voting trust, proxy or
other agreement or understanding with respect to the Purchased Equity
Interests.

 

Section 5.6 _Litigation_. Except as set forth on _Section 5.6_ of the Caesars

or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable; (ii) obtain any Consents from, and all
declarations, filings and registrations with, any Governmental Entity
(including any Gaming Authority) required in connection with the

of the transactions governed herein; and (iii) make all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings, and thereafter make any other
submissions with respect to this Agreement, as required under any applicable
Law.

with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Growth Partners, on the
one hand, and the Caesars Parties, on the other hand, agree to comply with
the terms and conditions of all such Gaming Licenses (including the

(c) Each of the Caesars Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain prior to the Closing all Consents under each Contract listed or
described on _Section 9.3(c)_ of the Caesars Disclosure Schedule. Any

49 Section 8.3 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the
Closing or the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 10.1_, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information and Gaming Laws, each Caesars Party
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Growth Partners
and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to all
of its and its Subsidiaries properties (including the Casinos), books and
records, Contracts and authorized Representatives with respect to the
Purchased Interests and the properties and businesses underlying the
Purchased Interests. Growth Partners shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives to, use reasonable efforts to prevent
such access and inspection from materially interfering with the business
operations of the Caesars Parties.

(b) During the period from the Closing Date to the fourth (4th) anniversary
of a Liquidation Event (as defined in the Growth Partners Operating
Agreement) or for such longer period as may be required by applicable Law,
Parent and each Seller shall retain all original accounting books and records
relating to the Purchased Interests and the properties and businesses
underlying the Purchased Interests for the period prior to the Closing Date.
Growth Partners and their Representatives shall have the reasonable right to
inspect and to make copies (at their own expense) of them at any time upon
reasonable request during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice for
any proper purpose and without undue interference to the business operations
of Parent or any Seller. Parent and each Seller shall provide reasonable
cooperation in connection with any such inspection and, if requested by Growth
Partners, Parent and each Seller shall provide access to such employees with
knowledge of the books and records to assist in such investigations.

 

Section 8.4 _Further Assurances_. In addition to the actions specifically
provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time and from time to time
after the execution of this Agreement and/or following the Closing, (a) at
Growth Partners reasonable request, Parent and each Seller shall do, execute,
acknowledge and deliver, or will cause its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to do,
execute, acknowledge and deliver, all and every such further acts and
assurances as Growth Partners reasonably may require to convey, transfer and
vest in Growth Partners (or its designated direct or indirect Subsidiary)
the Purchased Assets or to confirm Growth Partners (or its designated direct
or indirect Subsidiarys) title to the Purchased Assets, (b) at the Caesars
Parties reasonable request in the event that the Caesars Parties
reasonably determine that the condition to Closing set forth in _Section
9.1(b)_ will not be capable of being satisfied prior to the then-current
Outside Date, Growth Partners and CAC shall use reasonable best efforts to
request that the Financing Lenders amend the Commitment Letter such that the
termination date contained therein is extended to a date that is later than
the date on which the Caesars Parties reasonably expect the condition to
Closing set forth in _Section 9.1(b)_ to be capable of being satisfied (but
in any event no later than August 31, 2014), _provided_ that Growth Partners
and CAC shall not be required to accept any such amendment if the terms and
conditions (other than the extended termination date) of the amended
Commitment Letter are less favorable to Growth Partners and CAC as compared to
the terms of the original Commitment Letter, and (c) the

 



50  Parties shall do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or will cause its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, all and
every such further acts and assurances as reasonably required to carry out
the provisions hereof and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.5 _Public Announcements_. No Party to this Agreement nor any
Affiliate or Representative of such Party shall issue or cause the publication
of any press release or public announcement in respect of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law
or stock exchange rules (upon the advice of counsel) in which case the Party
required to publish such press release or public announcement shall use
reasonable efforts to provide the other Party a reasonable opportunity to
comment on such press release or public announcement in advance of such
publication. 

Section 8.6 _Transfer Taxes and Tax Refunds_.

 

(a) All transfer, recording, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other such Taxes (including real estate transfer or similar Tax that arise
from any indirect transfer of property as a result of the transfer of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and related fees (including any
penalties, interest and additions to Tax) incurred with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be
paid one-half by Growth Partners and one-half by Sellers. Each Party shall
indemnify, defend and hold the other Parties harmless from and against the
portion of any Transfer Taxes for which such other Parties are liable
pursuant to this _Section 8.6_. The Party responsible under applicable Law
for filing the Tax Returns pertaining to and paying such Transfer Taxes shall
(i) timely file such Tax Returns and remit to the applicable Governmental
Authority payment of the Transfer Taxes required to be remitted therewith and
(ii) promptly provide a copy of such Tax Return to the other Party or Parties,
and such other Party or Parties shall promptly reimburse the Party that paid
such Transfer Taxes for one-half of the amount of such Transfer Taxes that
were paid. Each of the Parties shall cooperate as requested in preparing,
executing and filing all such Tax Returns and related documentation on a
timely basis as may be required to comply with the provisions of any
applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else herein to the
contrary, and for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid or that become
payable pursuant to the matters described on _Section 11.2(h)_ of the
Caesars Disclosure Schedule shall not constitute a Transfer Tax for purposes
of this Agreement.

 

(b) Sellers shall be entitled to any refund or credit of or against Taxes with
respect to a taxable period (or portion thereof) prior to the Closing Date
(and any interest or penalty rebate with respect to such refund or credit) of
any Purchased Entity and its Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such
refund or credit is attributable to the carryback of a Tax attribute of
Growth Partners or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries from a taxable
period (or portion thereof) after the Closing Date. Growth Partners shall be
entitled to any refund or credit of or against any Taxes of any Purchased
Entity and its Subsidiaries (and any interest or penalty rebate with respect
to such refund or credit) other than refunds or credits to which such
Purchased Entity would be entitled under the preceding sentence. Each Party
shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the Party
entitled to a refund or credit of Taxes pursuant to this

 



51   _Section 8.6(b)_, the amount of such refund or credit within ten (10) days
after such refund or credit is received or applied against another Tax
liability, as the case may be, in each case net of reasonable costs
(including Taxes, if any) incurred by the Party receiving such refund or
credit.

Section 8.7  _Certain Notifications_.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, each of the Parties
shall promptly notify the other Parties in writing, as soon as practical
after it becomes known to such Party, of:

(i) any breach by such Party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement;

(ii) any fact, circumstance, event or action which will result in, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, the failure of such Party to timely
satisfy any of the closing conditions specified in _Article IX_ hereof; and

 

(iii) any pending or, to the knowledge of such Party, threatened action, suit,
arbitration or other proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Entity
or any other Person (i) challenging or seeking Damages in connection with the
Closing or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or (ii)
seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Closing.

(b) Nothing contained in this _Section 8.7_ shall prevent the Parties from
giving such notice, using such efforts or taking any action to cure any of
the foregoing. No notice given pursuant to this _Section 8.7_ shall have any
effect on the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement for purposes of determining satisfaction of any condition
contained herein or the Parties rights to indemnification hereunder.

Section 8.8 _Lien Release_. Each of the Caesars Parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to facilitate and encourage the making of any filings,
releases, discharges, deeds and other documents necessary to evidence the
release by all financial institutions and other Persons (the " _Lenders_ ")
of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) on the Purchased Equity Interests or
any property or assets of the Company Parties or their respective Subsidiaries
relating to Indebtedness owed by any of the Caesars Parties or their
Subsidiaries (" _Lender Liens_ "), and all obligations (including guarantee
obligations) of the Company Parties and their respective Subsidiaries in
respect of such Indebtedness (" _Loan Obligations_ "), before or
substantially simultaneously with the Closing. Each of the Caesars Parties
shall request that the Lenders deliver letters or similar written confirmation
(each, a " _Release Confirmation_ "), before or substantially simultaneously
with the Closing, confirming that (a) all Lender Liens shall be, upon the
Closing Date, released by all lenders thereunder and (b) all Loan Obligations
shall be, upon the Closing Date, released. Each of the Caesars Parties shall
keep Growth Partners reasonably informed (orally and in writing) on a current
basis regarding any material developments relating to their request for
Release Confirmations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that the Indebtedness outstanding under the Bills Credit Facility
will remain outstanding at Closing and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Liens
securing such Indebtedness will not be released.

 



52 Section 8.9 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent or Sellers shall deliver to Growth Partners
copies of the audited financial statements of the Company Parties and their
consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole (and not, for the avoidance of
doubt, with respect to each Company Party and its consolidated Subsidiaries on
an individual basis) as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 and
for the two fiscal year periods ending on such dates prepared by Deloitte and
Touche LLP (the " _Audited Financial Statements_ "). If the Closing occurs,

amendment that is materially inconsistent with the Cromwell Construction
Plans shall require the prior written consent of Growth Partners (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) The Caesars Parties shall promptly notify Growth Partners of any material
change or deviation from the Cromwell Construction Plans or any fact,
circumstance, event or action which will result in, or would reasonably be
expected to result in, any material change or deviation from the Cromwell
Construction Plans or any delay in the Cromwell Completion Date, the Cromwell
Casino Target Opening Date or the Cromwell Nightclub Target Opening Date.

(d) At least five (5) business days prior to the anticipated opening date for
The Cromwell, or at such earlier time as requested by Property Manager
pursuant to the Property Management Agreement with respect to The Cromwell,
CEOC shall cause The Cromwell to have an amount of House Funds at least equal
to $2,700,000. In the event that, at any time, and

plans with respect to interior fit out, furnishings, fixtures and equipment
(the " _Design Package_ "). Growth Partners shall have thirty (30) days
following receipt of the Design Package (or any portion thereof) to review or
approve the Design Package or such portion thereof. If Growth Partners does
not deliver to the Caesars Parties written comments on, or written objections
to, the Design Package (or such portion thereof) within such thirty (30) day
period, Growth Partners shall be deemed to have approved the Design Package
(or portion thereof) as presented. If, on the other hand, Growth Partners
provides timely written comments or written objections to the Design Package
(or portion thereof), Growth Partners and the Caesars Parties shall use good
faith efforts to resolve any such comments and/or objections in a timely
manner. Following resolution of any comments and/or objections (as evidenced
by written agreement of the Parties), such Design Package (or such portion
thereof) shall be, for all purposes of this Agreement, the " _Approved Design
Package_."

(c) The Caesars Parties shall promptly notify Growth Partners of any proposed

54 Section 8.13 _Financing_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, each of CAC and Growth Partners will use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
Financing as contemplated by and in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Commitment Letter (as modified by the flex provisions of the related
fee letter and as otherwise modified, so long as such modification would not
(i) impose new or additional material conditions or reasonably be expected to
prevent, or materially delay or impair, the availability of the Financing or
(ii) adversely impact the ability of CAC and Growth Partners to timely
consummate the Closing (it being understood that any modification that is
entered into for the purpose of adding lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Commitment
Letter as of the date hereof or for the purpose of extending the termination
date set forth in the Commitment Letter shall be permitted)), provided,
however, that if the Financing becomes unavailable to CAC and Growth Partners
on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter or the
Commitment Letter shall be terminated for any reason (other than due to a
material breach by the Caesars Parties of any material provision of this
Agreement which prevents or renders impracticable the consummation of the
Financing), each of CAC and Growth Partners shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain alternative financing on terms and conditions satisfactory
to CAC and Growth Partners and, to the extent required under applicable Law,
approved by the relevant Gaming Authorities (the " _Alternative Financing_ ").
It is understood and agreed that "reasonable best efforts" as used in this
_Section 8.13(a)_ shall not require CAC or Growth Partners to obtain the
Alternative Financing if the terms and conditions of such financing (including
all terms, termination rights, flex provisions and funding conditions) are
less favorable, taken as a whole, to CAC, Growth Partners and its
Subsidiaries as compared to the terms of the Commitment Letter. Each of the
Caesars Parties shall, at CACs and Growth Partners cost and expense, provide
such cooperation as is reasonably requested by CAC and Growth Partners in
connection with obtaining any such Financing (or any Alternative Financing) or
the 144A Financing, pursuant to _Section 8.13(b)_. Upon the request of Parent
or a Seller, CAC and Growth Partners shall apprise Parent and such Seller of
material developments relating to the Financing or any Alternative Financing
and reasonably promptly shall, upon the written request of Parent and CEOC,
provide copies of all definitive documents agreed with the Financing Lenders
or otherwise related to the Financing or any Alternative Financing to Parent
or a Seller, subject to customary redaction of fee amounts and other economic
terms (including interest rates).

 

For purposes of this Agreement, references to "Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as amended, modified, waived
or replaced in accordance with this _Section 8.13(a)_ and references to
"Commitment Letter" shall include the Commitment Letter as amended, modified,
waived or replaced in accordance with this  _Section 8.13(a)_.

(b) Prior to the Closing, each of the Caesars Parties shall provide, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, in each case,
with appropriate

 



55  seniority and expertise, including its or their accounting firms, to

reasonably requested by CAC and Growth Partners in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing (including any Alternative Financing) and the
144A Financing, including by, in each case upon reasonable advance notice and
on a reasonable number of occasions:

 

(i) assisting in the preparation for and participation in the marketing
efforts in connection with the syndication of the financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letter or the Alternative Financing (including a reasonable
number of lender meetings and conference calls) or the 144A Financing, other
meetings, presentations, drafting sessions, road shows, due
diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions
with the Financing Lenders, any lenders providing Alternative Financing or any
initial purchasers of the 144A Financing (such lenders and initial purchasers,
together with the Financing Lenders, the " _Applicable Financing Lenders_ "),
other prospective lenders and investors and ratings agencies, and assisting
CAC and Growth Partners in obtaining ratings as contemplated by the Financing,
the Alternative Financing, and the 144A Financing, if any;

(ii) cooperating with CAC, Growth Partners and the Applicable
Financing Lenders, including, as applicable, reasonably assisting with the
preparation of rating agency presentations, pro forma financial information

respect to the presence or absence of material non-public information and the
accuracy of the information contained in the disclosure and
marketing materials related to the Financing (including any Alternative
Financing)));

(iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, (A) furnishing CAC, Growth
Partners and the Applicable Financing Lenders and their respective
Representatives with the Required Information, (B) informing CAC and Growth
Partners if the chief executive officer, chief financial offer, treasurer or
controller of the Caesars Parties or any director or member of the Caesars
Parties shall have actual knowledge of any facts as a result of which a
restatement of any financial statements for such financial statements to
comply with GAAP is, to such persons actual knowledge, probable;

(iv) both before the Closing and, to the extent reasonably necessary to allow
CAC and Growth Partners to consummate a securities offering or comply with SEC
requirements after the Closing (but in either case at CACs and Growth
Partners cost and expense), providing appropriate representations with
respect to information for periods prior to the Closing customary in
connection with the preparation of financial statements and other financial
data of the Company Parties and requesting accountants consents in connection
with the use of the Company Parties financial statements for periods prior

most recently completed fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year ending

Contracts relating to the Company Parties (or the Purchased Entities) and to
arrange discussions among CAC, Growth Partners and the Applicable Financing
Lenders and their respective Representatives with other parties to material
leases, encumbrances and Contracts as of the Closing;

Subsidiaries, if any (not needed for other purposes), to be made available on
the Closing Date to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, any costs, fees or
expenses incurred or required to be paid in connection with the consummation
of the Financing or any Alternative Financing shall not constitute Unpaid
Caesars Expenses hereunder and the Caesars Parties shall have no liability or
obligation in connection therewith;

 



57 (x) providing at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date

be required to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the
execution of the Financing (including any Alternative Financing), (B) no
obligation of the Caesars Parties or any of their respective Representatives
undertaken pursuant to the foregoing shall be effective until the Closing Date

expenses and other amounts payable to Deloitte and Touche LLP in connection
with the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements shall be treated in

hold harmless the Caesars Parties and their respective Representatives from

(other than Damages which are the subject matter of any successful
indemnification claim pursuant to  _Section 11.2_ by a Growth Indemnified

compliance with this _Section 8.13_ and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information provided by or on behalf of the
Caesars Parties or their respective Representatives), in each case, except to
the extent suffered or incurred as a result of bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct of, or material breach of this Agreement by, the Caesars
Parties.

Nothing contained in this  _Section 8.13(b)_ or otherwise shall require any
Caesars Party (other than, from and after the Closing, any Company Party) to
be an issuer, guarantor, pledgor or other obligor with respect to the
Financing (including any Alternative Financing) or the 144A Financing, if
any. Each of the Caesars Parties hereby expressly authorizes the use of the
financial statements and other information to be provided pursuant to this
_Section 8.13(b)_ for purposes of the Financing (including any Alternative
Financing).

 



58 (c) Each of the Caesars Parties hereby consents to the use of its logos in
connection with the Financing (including any Alternative Financing); provided
that such logos shall be used by CAC, Growth Partners and the Financing
Lenders in a manner that is not intended to, or reasonably likely to, harm or
disparage the Caesars Parties or the reputation or goodwill of the Caesars
Parties.

(d) Prior to and through the Closing, the Caesars Parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to periodically update any Required Information provided to CAC
and Growth Partners as may be necessary so that such Required Information is
(i) Compliant and (ii) meets the applicable requirements set forth in the
definition of "Required Information". For the avoidance of doubt, CAC and
Growth Partners may, to most effectively access the financing markets, require
the cooperation of the Caesars Parties under this Section 8.13 at any time,
and from time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date hereof and
the Closing; _provided_ that CAC and Growth Partners shall comply with
_Section 8.13(b)_ with respect to any requests for cooperation and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to limit interference with the ongoing
operations of the Caesars Parties. The Caesars Parties shall timely file SEC
documents and other materials with the SEC to the extent required by the SEC
in accordance with Law to the extent such SEC documents relate specifically
to the Company Parties or any of their Subsidiaries. In addition, if, in
connection with a marketing effort contemplated by the Commitment Letter, CAC
and Growth Partners reasonably request the Caesars Parties to file a Current
Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains material non-
public information with respect to the Company Parties or any of their
Subsidiaries, which CAC and Growth Partners reasonably determine to include in
a customary offering memorandum for the Financing, then Caesars Parties shall
file a Current Report on Form 8-K containing such material non-public
information.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Caesars Parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause their independent auditors to provide, consistent with
customary practice, (A) consent to SEC filings and offering memoranda that
include or incorporate the Company Parties consolidated financial information
and their reports thereon, in each case, to the extent such consent is
required, customary auditors reports and customary comfort letters (including
"negative assurance" comfort) with respect to financial information relating
to the Company Parties or their Subsidiaries in connection with the
144A Financing, if any, (B) reasonable assistance in the preparation of pro
forma financial statements by CAC and Growth Partners and (C) reasonable
assistance to and cooperation with CAC and Growth Partners, including
attending accounting due diligence sessions, in connection with the Financing
(including any Alternative Financing), the 144A Financing and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 8.14 _Restructuring Transactions; Intercompany Liabilities_.

 

(a) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, CEOC shall
consummate the Restructuring Transactions and shall provide Growth Partners
satisfactory evidence thereof, together with a copy of all documents,
agreements and instruments executed in connection therewith. Immediately
following the consummation of the Restructuring Transactions, CEOC shall
cause (i) the NewCo Sellers to execute and deliver to CAC and Growth Partners
a joinder to this Agreement, in the form attached as _Exhibit G_ hereto (the
" _Joinder_ "); and (ii) each of the Property Managers to execute and deliver
to CAC and Growth Partners a Joinder.

 



59 (b) CEOC shall ensure that following consummation of the Restructuring
Transactions, and as of the Closing, (i) each of the NewCo LLCs shall own or
otherwise have both (x) the rights to use, to the same extent as the relevant
Company Party or Company Subsidiary as applicable, did immediately prior to
the Restructuring Transactions, all of the assets that were used or held for
use by such Company Party or Company Subsidiary in their respective businesses
conducted by them immediately prior to the Restructuring Transactions, and (y)
the services of the applicable Property Employees and (ii) none of the NewCo
LLCs, CIC, JCC Holding or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall have any
Liabilities (A) owing to Parent or any of its Affiliates other than
Liabilities (i) reflected on the Estimated Closing Statement and the Final
Closing Statement and (ii) taken into consideration for purposes of
calculating Estimated Closing Net Working Capital and Final Closing Net
Working Capital, or (B) for Taxes for which the transferor may be
liable pursuant to Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-6, similar provisions
of state or local law, or otherwise as a result of being a member of a
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group.

 

Section 8.15 _Amendments and Terminations_. Prior to the Closing, the Caesars
Parties shall (a) terminate the agreements set forth on _Section 8.15(a)_ of
the Growth Partners Disclosure Schedule and receive a binding release of all
claims thereunder and (b) amend the agreements set forth on _Section 8.15(b)_
of the Growth Partners Disclosure Schedule, in the manner set forth therein,
in the case of each of clauses (a) and (b), in form and substance satisfactory
to Growth Partners. The Caesars Parties shall provide Growth Partners
satisfactory evidence thereof, together with a copy of all documents,
agreements and instruments executed in connection therewith.

Section 8.16 _Employee and Benefit Plan Matters_.

(a) Each of the Parties shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable best
efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, identify
any Property Employee who provides a supervisory function to one or more of
the Casinos, on the one hand, and to other facilities owned or operated by the
Caesars Parties (other than the Purchased Entities or their Subsidiaries) on
the other hand (such employees, the " _Management Employees_ "). The Caesars
Parties shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to,
transfer and assign the employment of, and all employment-related obligations
(including but not limited to employment Contracts) of, any Management
Employees employed by any of the Company Parties or the Purchased Entities (or
their respective Subsidiaries) to Services Co. effective as of the Closing
Date (or, if Services Co. has not then been established, to CEOC or one of its
Affiliates), such that, as of the Closing Date, none of the Purchased Entities
or their respective Subsidiaries is an employer of any Management Employees.
The Caesars Parties shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to, transfer and assign the employment of, and all employment-
related obligations (including but not limited to employment Contracts) of,
any Property Employees (other than Management Employees) employed by the
Caesars Parties or their Subsidiaries (other than the Purchased Entities or
their respective Subsidiaries) to the Purchased Entities or their respective
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, such that, as of the Closing Date, a
Purchased Entity or its Subsidiary is the employer of the then-current
Property Employees.

 



60 (b) Prior to the Closing, Parent or CEOC, as applicable, shall, in a manner
which complies with all applicable Laws, (i) amend its defined contribution
savings and retirement plans as necessary or appropriate to both (x)
constitute a plan maintained by more than one employer within the meaning of
Section 413(c) of the Code and (y) identify each applicable Company Party or
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as an employer maintaining such plan and (ii)
subject to _Section 8.16(e)_, take such actions as are necessary so that,
effective at the Closing, the Property Employees who were participating in
the Caesars Benefit Plans that provide medical, dental, vision, disability and
other health and welfare benefits immediately prior to the Closing will
participate in plans that are substantially similar,  _mutatis mutandis_ , to
those covering the Property Employees under the Caesars Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Mirror H andW Plans_"); which Mirror
HandW Plans may, in the discretion of CEOC, be sponsored after the Closing by
an applicable Purchased Entity or its Subsidiary or an ERISA Affiliate of
them, _provided_ , however, that no Mirror HandW Plan shall constitute a
multiple employer welfare arrangement. Notwithstanding anything in this 
_Section 8.16(b)_ to the contrary, on and after the Closing, Growth Partners
shall cause its Subsidiaries to continue to provide those Property Employees
who are covered by a Labor Agreement with those pension, health and welfare
and fringe benefits provided under the Union Plans in accordance with the
terms of each such Labor Agreement, and, except as set forth on _Section
8.16(b)_ of the Caesars Disclosure Schedule, such Property Employees covered
by such Labor Agreements shall not be eligible to participate in or otherwise
receive benefits under the pension and Mirror HandW Plans hereinabove described
for the Property Employees not covered by a Labor Agreement.

 

(c) In connection with the actions contemplated by this _Section 8.16_ and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Restructuring Transactions, CEOC shall, or shall cause each
Property Employer to, at its own expense, give all notices and other
information required to be given to and satisfy any bargaining obligations
prior to the Closing with respect to, any Property Employee, any labor or
trade union, works council or any other employee representative body, and/or
any applicable Governmental Entity, whether under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act or any similar state or local law (the " _WARN
Act_ "), the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, the Code, the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, any other applicable
Laws, or a Labor Agreement. Neither CEOC nor any of its Subsidiaries or any
Property Employer will take any action with respect to any Property Employees
prior to the Closing that would constitute a plant closing or mass layoff
within the meaning of, or otherwise trigger notice, compensation, or
other obligations under the WARN Act. With respect to any Property Employees
whose employment transfers pursuant to _Section 8.16(a)_, the entity
employing such persons shall pay to such persons all wages accrued through and
ending with the effective date of such transfer, any severance or other
contractual liability that is triggered by such transfer, and shall provide
for the withholding and remittance of all applicable Tax withholdings for any
such amounts.

 

(d) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring any of the
Parties or their respective Affiliates to continue any specific employee
benefit plans or to continue the employment of any specific person. The
provisions of this _Section 8.16_ are solely for the benefit of the Parties
to this Agreement, and no current or former director, officer, employee
or independent contractor or any other person shall be a third-party
beneficiary of this _Section 8.16_, and nothing herein shall be construed as
an amendment to any compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any
purpose.

 



61 (e) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 8.16(b)(ii)_ to the contrary, in the
event that any Mirror HandW Plan is not fully implemented and effective as of
the Closing such that the requirements contained in _Section 8.16(b)(ii)_
cannot be satisfied as of the Closing (any such plan, a " _Pending Mirror H
andW Plan_"), then for the period (the " _Transition Period_ ") commencing on
the Closing and ending at midnight on such date as such Pending Mirror HandW
Plan is fully implemented and effective and capable of providing the coverage
described in _Section 8.16(b)(ii)_ or such other date as the Parties may
mutually determine, but in no event later than December 31, 2014 (the "
_Benefit Changeover Date_ "), the applicable Caesars Party sponsoring each
Transition Benefit agrees to make available coverage (including COBRA
coverage), employee call centers and claims processing services to and in
respect to the Property Employees who are employees of the Purchased Entities
immediately prior to and following the Closing; _provided_ , however, that
the Caesars Parties shall indemnify and hold Growth Partners harmless against
any Liabilities associated with the provision of Transition Benefits, except
as specifically contemplated by this _Section 8.16(e)_. For purposes of this
_Section 8.16(e)_, the " _Transition Benefits_ " shall mean those particular
medical, dental, vision, disability and other health and welfare plans
in which Property Employees participate immediately prior to the Closing
which would otherwise be provided under a Pending Mirror HandW Plan and which
will be provided upon the full implementation and effectiveness thereof, and
such additional benefits which the parties otherwise mutually agree to
include within the definition of " _Transition Benefits_ " as soon as
practicable following the date hereof. The applicable Caesars Party or its
service provider administering each Transition Benefit shall honor any claims
for benefits under such Transition Benefits which are incurred prior to the
Benefit Changeover Date and which are presented to such administrator in
accordance with the terms of the particular plan, program, policy or
arrangement establishing the particular Transition Benefit; provided, however,
that such claims are presented prior to the expiration of the twelve (12)
month period beginning on the Benefit Changeover Date. Growth Partners
shall reimburse the applicable Caesars Party for the actual aggregate
employer and employee premium cost, including any monthly service charges
imposed by the applicable Caesars Partys service provider which are paid
directly by the applicable Caesars Party (" _Aggregate Premium Cost_ "), of
providing such Transition Benefits during the Transition Period within forty-
five (45) days after the applicable Caesars Party submits written proof of
such Aggregate Premium Cost to Growth Partners. To the extent a particular
Transition Benefit is administered by a third party service provider, the
applicable Caesars Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such service providers consent to the substitution of Growth Partners or one
of its Subsidiaries as the party legally responsible for providing the
particular Transition Benefit on and after the Closing but otherwise
continuing to treat the particular Transition Benefit as administered by the
applicable Caesars Party and its service providers throughout the Transition
Period.

Section 8.17 _Permits and Other Filings_.

(a) From the Closing Date until Growth Partners elects otherwise, in Growth
Partners sole discretion, CEOC will retain responsibility for compliance in
all respects with the Part 70 Operating Permit for Source 257 issued by Clark
County Department of Air Quality to CEOC (the " _Title V Permit_ ") and cause
the Title V Permit to be retained in CEOCs name for the air pollution
sources associated with the operations of the Purchased Assets and the hotel
and casino commonly known as Planet Hollywood (the " _Air Sources_ ") until
such time as Clark County or another Governmental Entity with jurisdiction
over the Title V Permit requires that a

 



62  Permit (or Permits) for the Air Sources be issued directly to Growth
Partners or its designated Subsidiary for the Air Sources (a " _New Permit_
"), including filing for and diligently pursuing, at CEOCs sole cost and
expense, current renewal of the Title V Permit in accordance with
Environmental Law as soon as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement; _provided_ that any election by Growth Partners pursuant to this
_Section 8.17(a)_ shall be subject to the approval of the relevant
Governmental Entities, and in accordance with _Section 8.17(d)_ of this
Agreement.

 

(b) From the Closing Date up to and including the date that a New Permit or
New Permits are issued for all of the Air Sources, in the event that Growth
Partners determines that it will voluntarily seek to obtain New Permits for
the Air Sources, and provided that the relevant Governmental Entities have no
objection to such New Permits being sought, CEOC will reasonably cooperate
with Growth Partners, including by executing such documents and instruments
as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to cause Growth Partners or its
designated Subsidiary to obtain a New Permit or become the successor to the
Title V Permit (as it relates to the Air Sources), as the applicable
Governmental Entity may require. Costs and expenses incurred to obtain New
Permits for the Air Sources shall be paid by Growth Partners; provided that
any costs and expenses relating to air sources owned by CEOC or other third
parties shall be paid by CEOC. With respect to costs and expenses that cannot
be directly attributed to particular air sources regulated by the Title V
Permit, such costs and expenses shall be allocated between the parties pro
rata based on the number of rooms at the facilities regulated under the Title
V Permit that each party owns or otherwise controls.

 

(c) Growth Partners agrees to reimburse CEOC for fee payments and any other
direct costs incurred by CEOC, including reasonable consultants fees and
annual emission fees, in connection with the maintenance of the Title V Permit
for the Air Sources from the Closing Date up to and including the date that a
New Permit is issued or Growth Partners becomes the successor to the Title V
Permit. Growth Partners further agrees to reasonably cooperate with CEOC,
including by executing such documents and instruments as may be necessary to
comply with any and all quarterly or annual reporting and/or testing
obligations under the Title V Permit for the Air Sources and reimburse CEOC
for CEOCs costs in connection therewith.

(d) Growth Partners and CEOC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate under this _Section 8.17_, as necessary to obtain, modify or renew
permits for the Air Sources, including but not limited to, consulting with
each other on any issues that require regulatory approval and could have a
material adverse impact on the operations of CEOC or Growth Partners with
respect to the Air Sources, cooperating with the relevant Governmental
Entities, participating in the public comment process, and working with
interested parties and neighboring landowners, for so long as any permits for
the Air Sources are required by Law or held by CEOC or Growth Partners.

 

(e) If, at any time, CEOC receives a notice of violation or other
noncompliance or liability relating to the Title V Permit for the
Air Sources, CEOC shall reasonably promptly notify Growth Partners of CEOCs
receipt of such notice, and CEOC shall indemnify Growth Partners for any costs
associated with defending and/or paying fines or other losses or Damages
associated with any such notice to the extent that such fines or other
liabilities

 



63  result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of CEOC or a breach
of any Property Management Agreement by any Property Manager. If Growth
Partners determines, in its reasonable discretion, that CEOC will not cause
such violation to be cured in a timely fashion, Growth Partners shall have the
right to cure or cause to be cured such violation; provided, however, that
CEOC shall have the right to contest in good faith any such violation, and
Growth Partners shall not take any action to cure, or cause to be cured, such
violation until the good faith contest of such violation by CEOC has been
completed; provided, further, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, Growth Partners shall have the right to cure, or cause to be
cured, such violation if Growth Partners determines that failure to cure such
violation will be reasonably likely to result in Growth Partners being
"permit-blocked" in any state or under the federal Applicant Violator System
or any equivalent state or local Law.

Section 8.18 _Services Joint Venture_. Each Property Owner is entering into
the applicable Property Management Agreement with the applicable Property
Manager at the Closing, pursuant to which, among other things, the Property
Managers are providing management services to the applicable Casino and
access to the Total Rewards® Program on the terms contemplated herein, which
the Parties acknowledge, together with the related Intellectual Property
arrangements contemplated under the Property Management Agreement Term Sheet,
are critical elements of the transaction such that Growth Partners would not
have entered into this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements without the
fundamental understanding that this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
together with the Services Joint Venture Arrangements, taken as a whole,
represent a single, integrated transaction. In furtherance of the foregoing,
the Parties covenant and agree to use reasonable best efforts to establish
a mutually satisfactory services joint venture arrangement, based on good
faith negotiations, as reflected in the Services Joint Venture Term Sheet
attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ (the " _Services Joint Venture Arrangements_ ")
with such other terms as the Parties may agree, as promptly as practicable
following the date hereof with the intention of being in place as of the
Closing Date, subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals
with respect to any portion of such arrangements for which approval is
required, _provided_ , however, that the Services Joint Venture Arrangements
shall not become effective prior to the Closing.

expected to cause, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect in respect of any Company Party.

on the failure of any condition set forth in  _Section 9.1_, _9.2_ or _9.3_

comply with any provision of this Agreement.

10.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any Party to this Agreement whose breach

(ii) if any Order issued, or Law adopted, promulgated or issued by a
Governmental Entity (including any Gaming Authority) permanently restrains,

material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other

warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth herein in a manner that
would cause any condition set forth in _Section 9.3(a)_ or _Section 9.3(b)_
not to be satisfied;

 

(d) by Growth Partners if any of the Caesars Parties shall have breached or
failed to perform in any material respect any of its

the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(d)_ if
Growth Partners is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreement set forth herein in a manner that
would cause any condition set forth in _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.2(b)_

(i) If an Indemnified Person becomes aware of any act, omission or state of
facts that may give rise to Damages in respect of which a right of
indemnification is provided for under this _Article XI_ , the Indemnified
Person must notify the Indemnifying Person, which notice shall specify whether
the potential Damages arise as a result of:

 

(1) a claim directly by the Indemnified Person against the Indemnifying Person
(a " _Direct Claim_ "); or

 

(2) a claim made by a Person against the Indemnified Person (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ");

 



72 as soon as reasonably practicable, _provided_ that the failure to provide such
notice as soon as reasonably practicable to the Indemnifying Person shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Person of liability except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Person is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay.

 

(ii) The Indemnified Person must include in a notice given under clause (i)
relevant details then known to the Indemnified Person of the Direct Claim or
Third Party Claim, and the events, matters or circumstances giving rise to the
Direct Claim or Third Party Claim and an extract of any document that
identifies the liability or amount to which the Direct Claim or Third Party
Claim relates or other evidence of the amount of the Direct Claim or Third
Party Claim, and must after giving such notice keep the Indemnifying Person
reasonably informed of all developments in relation to the Direct Claim or
Third Party Claim.

(iii) If the Indemnifying Person has timely disputed its indemnity obligations
for any Damages with respect to such Direct Claim, the Parties shall proceed
in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved
through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an
appropriate court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to  _Section 11.5_.

(b) _Third Party Claims_.

 

(i) In the case of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have the
right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim
and to compromise or settle such Third Party Claim; _provided_ that in no
event shall the Indemnifying Person compromise or settle such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person if (1) such
compromise or settlement does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Person of a full
release from all liability in respect to such Third Party Claim, (2) as a
result of such consent or settlement, injunctive or other equitable relief
would be imposed against the Indemnified Person, (3) such compromise or
settlement includes (A) any admission or statement suggesting any
wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the Indemnified Person or (B) any term
that in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of the
Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates or (4) such settlement or
compromise imposes liability on the part of the Indemnified Person that is
not indemnified by the Indemnifying Person hereunder; _provided_ _further_
that the Indemnifying Person shall reimburse the Indemnified Person for the
reasonable costs of the Indemnified Person relating to such Third Party Claim
and the conduct of any defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Person assumes the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the obligations of
the Indemnifying Person under this Agreement shall include taking all steps
reasonably necessary in the investigation, defense or settlement of such Third
Party Claim (including the retention of legal counsel) and holding the
Indemnified Person under this Agreement harmless from and against any and all
Damages caused by or arising out of any settlement approved by such
Indemnifying Person or any judgment in connection with such Third Party Claim.

 



73 (ii) If requested by the Indemnified Person, the Indemnifying Person will
provide to the Indemnified Person copies of all pleadings, notices,
communications, documentary or other evidence with respect to such Third Party
Claim, except where receipt of such documents would waive any claim of
privilege by the Indemnifying Person or its legal representative.

(iii) The Indemnified Person is entitled to, at its own cost and expense,
liaise with the Indemnifying Person in relation to the defense of such Third
Party Claim, and participate in, but not to determine or conduct, any defense
of a Third Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect to a Third
Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Person has in its sole discretion
determined to permit the Indemnified Person to defend such Third Party Claim,
in which event the Indemnifying Person shall have the right to participate in,
but not to determine or conduct, any defense of a Third Party Claim or
settlement negotiations with respect to such Third Party Claim.

(iv) No settlement, resolution or compromise of such Third Party Claim by the
Indemnified Person is determinative of the existence or amount of any Damages
in respect of such Third Party Claim, unless the Indemnifying Person consents
in writing to such settlement, resolution or compromise, which consent must
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and shall be deemed to
have been given by the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person unless
the Indemnifying Person notifies the Indemnified Person in writing within ten
(10) Business Days of a request by the Indemnified Person that it does not
give its consent. In addition, notwithstanding anything else to the contrary,
the Indemnifying Person shall not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim
in respect of Taxes without the prior written consent of the relevant
Indemnified Person, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Person shall not be entitled to control, and, subject to the
proviso in this clause (v) of _Section 11.4(b)_, the Indemnified Person shall
be entitled to have control over, the defense or settlement of any Third Party
Claim if any of the following conditions are not satisfied: 

(1) the Indemnifying Person shall acknowledge in writing that it shall be
fully responsible, subject to this  _Article XII_ and all of its
limitations, for all Damages relating to such Third Party Claim;

(2) the Indemnifying Person must diligently defend such Third Party Claim;

(3) the Indemnifying Person must furnish the Indemnified Person with evidence
that the financial resources of the Indemnifying Person, in the Indemnified
Persons reasonable judgment, are and will be sufficient (when considering
Damages in respect of all other outstanding claims) to satisfy any Damages
relating to such Third Party Claim;

 



74 (4) such Third Party Claim shall not involve criminal actions or allegations
of criminal conduct by the Indemnified Person, and shall not involve claims
for specific performance or other equitable relief; and

 

(5) there does not exist, in the Indemnified Persons good faith judgment,
based on the advice of outside legal counsel, a conflict of interest which,
under applicable principles of legal ethics, could reasonably be expected to
prohibit a single legal counsel from representing both the Indemnified Person
and the Indemnifying Person in such Third Party Claim;

 

 _provided_ , that, in such event, the Indemnifying Person shall not be
required to indemnify the Indemnified Person for or in respect of any Third
Party Claim if such Third Party Claim is paid, settled or compromised without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Person (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 11.5 _Indemnification Principles and Limitations_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

 

(i) Except in the case of fraud, in no event shall the aggregate obligation of
(A) the Caesars Parties to indemnify Growth Indemnified Persons under
_Section 11.2(b)_ (other than for a breach of a Caesars Fundamental
Representation), or (B) Growth Partners to indemnify Caesars Indemnified
Persons under _Section 11.3(b)_ (other than for a breach of a Growth
Partners Fundamental Representation), respectively, exceed $200,000,000.

(ii) Except in the case of fraud, in no event shall the aggregate obligation
of (A) the Caesars Parties to indemnify Growth Indemnified Persons under
_Section 11.2(a)_ and _Section 11.2(b)_, or (B) CAC and Growth Partners to
indemnify Caesars Indemnified Persons under _Section 11.3(a)_ and _Section
11.3(b)_, respectively, exceed the Purchase Price.

(iii) No claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.2(b)_ (other
than for a breach of a Caesars Fundamental Representation), or _Section
11.3(b)_ (other than for a breach of a Growth Partners Fundamental
Representation), hereof may be made by any Growth Indemnified Person or any
Caesars Indemnified Person, respectively, (x) for any Damages from any single
loss or series of related losses not in excess of $500,000 and (y) until the
aggregate amount of all Damages for which claims may be made thereunder
exceeds $20,000,000 (it being understood that any Damages that do not exceed
the amount set forth in clause (x) shall be counted toward satisfaction of
such threshold), and once such threshold amount has been reached,
indemnification shall be made only in excess of such threshold amount.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, CACs and
Growth Partners sole and exclusive remedy for indemnification pursuant to

 



75   _Section 11.2(c)_ shall be (x) a fee of $75,000 for each day that the
hotel and casino with respect to The Cromwell are not open following the date
that is two (2) weeks after the Cromwell Casino Target Opening Date;
_provided_ that such fee shall increase to $100,000 per day following the date
that is four (4) weeks after the Cromwell Casino Target Opening Date, (y) an
additional fee of $37,500 for each day that the nightclub at The Cromwell is
not open following the date that is two (2) weeks after the Cromwell Nightclub
Target Opening Date; _provided_ that such additional fee shall increase to
$75,000 per day following the date that is four (4) weeks after the Cromwell
Nightclub Target Opening Date and (z) an additional fee of $12,500 for each
day that the restaurant at The Cromwell is not open following the date that is
two (2) weeks after the Cromwell Nightclub Target Opening Date; _provided_
that such additional fee shall increase to $25,000 per day following the date
that is four (4) weeks after the Cromwell Nightclub Target Opening Date, which
shall be paid to Growth Partners by CEOC promptly following a request by
Growth Partners therefor, in immediately available funds as liquidated damages
and not as a penalty.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, subsections (i) and (ii) of _Section
11.5(a)_ shall not apply to the special indemnities set forth in subsections
(c) through (h) of _Section 11.2_.

 

(c) Each Growth Indemnified Person or Caesars Indemnified Person, as
applicable, will take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate
all Damages indemnifiable under this _Article XI_ , which steps shall include
availing itself of any defenses, limitations, rights of contribution, claims
against third Persons and other rights at law or in equity and the reasonable
costs associated with such steps shall be included in the calculation of
Damages in respect of the relevant claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any such mitigation efforts
shall be deemed to be Damages. 

(d) Solely for purposes of calculating any Damages subject to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article XI_ , from and after the Closing, the
representations and warranties made herein shall be deemed to have been made
without the inclusion of limitations or qualifications as to materiality, such
as the words "material", "in all material respects", "material adverse
effect" or words of similar import and, accordingly, all references in such
representations and warranties to materiality shall be deemed to be deleted
therefrom for such purpose only.

 

(e) With respect to each indemnification obligation contained in this _Article
XI_ , all Damages shall be net of any third-party insurance and indemnity
proceeds actually recovered by the Indemnified Person under applicable
insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible
therefor. The Indemnified Person shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under all insurance and
indemnity provisions covering any Damages for which it is seeking
indemnification hereunder to the same extent as it would if such Damage were
not subject to indemnification hereunder;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any
reasonable expenses incurred in connection with seeking such remedy shall be
deemed to be Damages. Upon making any payment to the Indemnified Person for
any indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article XI_ , the Indemnifying
Person shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which
the Indemnified Person may have against any third parties with respect to the
subject matter underlying such indemnification claim, and the Indemnified
Person shall assign any such rights to the Indemnifying Person.

 



76 (f) Any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
reduced by the amount of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the
Indemnified Party through a reduction in Taxes otherwise due with respect to
the taxable year in which the Damages incurred or suffered by the Indemnified
Party are sustained as a result of such Damages. 

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, (i) any amounts
payable pursuant this Agreement shall be paid without duplication, and in no
event shall any Party be entitled to recover under different provisions of
this Agreement for the same amounts; and (ii) any Damages payable under this
_Article XI_ shall be payable in immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by the relevant Indemnified Person.

(h) Each of the Parties agrees to treat any indemnification payment made
pursuant to this _Article XI_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all
Tax purposes, to the extent it may be properly so treated for Tax purposes,
and shall take no position contrary thereto unless required to do so by
applicable Tax Law.

Section 11.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this
_Article XI_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (other than in the case of
fraud) for the Parties and their respective Affiliates for any
misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or any other provision
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto.

ARTICLE XII

Section 12.2 _Amendment and Waivers_. This Agreement may be modified,
supplemented or amended only by a written instrument executed by each of the

(a) This Agreement and any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and interpreted and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed and to be performed wholly within the State of Delaware and
without reference to the choice-of-law principles or rules of conflict
of laws that would result in, require or permit the application of the Laws
of a different jurisdiction or direct a matter to another jurisdiction.

 

(b) Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, solely if such courts
decline jurisdiction, in any federal court located in the State of Delaware)
(any such court, a " _Chosen Court_ ") any Action arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all
claims in respect of such Action may be heard and determined in a Chosen
Court. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent that it may effectively do so, any defense of an inconvenient
forum which such Party may now or hereafter have to the maintenance of such
Action. The Parties further agree, (i) to the extent permitted by Law, that
final and nonappealable judgment against any of them in any Action
contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a
certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of
such judgment and (ii) that service of process upon such Party in any such
action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
_Section 12.7_.

(c) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING
OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS
EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE ADMINISTRATION THEREOF OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER
LITIGATION PROCEDURE BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
RELATED INSTRUMENTS OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES. NO PARTY WILL
SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH
ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE 

 



78  MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS _SECTION 12.5_.

Section 12.8 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by electronic or facsimile transmission) in one or more
counterparts, and by the different Parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

Section 12.9 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party hereto.
Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely
as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 12.10 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties hereto do not
perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
Law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such order or injunction. The foregoing is
in addition to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled at Law, in
equity or otherwise. The Parties further agree that nothing set forth in this
_Section 12.10_ shall require any party hereto to institute any Action for
(or limit any Partys right to institute any Action for) specific performance
under this  _Section 12.10_ prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article X_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination).

 



80 Section 12.11 _Certain Lender Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each Caesars Party agrees on behalf of itself and
its stockholders and Representatives (collectively, the "Caesars Related
Parties"), that the Caesars Related Parties shall not assert (or support the
assertion of) any claims, actions or proceedings against the Financing
Lenders, whether at Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement, the
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby, and that the Financing
Lenders shall have no liability to the Caesars Related Parties in connection
therewith.
