as provided therein or by applicable Law. The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in

either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments
of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions
and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any
and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

to be specified by the parties (the "Closing Date"), such date to be no later

permitted by Law) waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Skadden, Arps,

such other date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the
Certificate of Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the
"Effective Time".

the Company Bylaws and applicable Securities Exchange Rules, establish a
record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting
of the Company's stockholders (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the "Special Meeting") as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, for the purpose of considering and voting on the matters
requiring the Company Stockholder Approval; provided that (i) if the Company
is unable to obtain a quorum of its stockholders at such time, the Company may
extend the date of the Special Meeting (provided that the Company is using
commercially

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

reasonable efforts to obtain such a quorum as promptly as practicable) and
(ii) the Company may postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting to the extent
required by applicable securities Laws.

  

  

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement relating to this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger (such proxy statement, as
amended or supplemented, the "Proxy Statement"), and furnish the information
required to be provided to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the
DGCL and the Exchange Act. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable following
the date of this Agreement. Parent will provide the Company with any

filing of the Proxy Statement pursuant to this Section 2.3(b). The Company
will notify Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff in connection with the filing of, or amendments or supplements to,
the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and
the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. Each of the Company and Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable
to any such comments of the SEC. Whenever any event occurs which is required
to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the
Company will promptly inform Parent of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the SEC or its staff, and/or mailing to stockholders of the Company, such
amendment or supplement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response and (ii) absent a reasonable objection,
shall include in such document or response all comments proposed by Parent;
provided that Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide or
cause to be provided its comments to the Company as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such document or response is transmitted to Parent for its
review. The Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation.

  

  

(c) If at any time prior to the Special Meeting any fact or event relating to
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement should occur or be discovered
by Parent or Merger Sub, Parent or Merger Sub shall, promptly after becoming
aware thereof, inform the Company of such fact or event.

CONVERSION OF SHARES

  

  

Section 3.1 Conversion of Company Common Stock.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(a) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares of
Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and (ii)
Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive $23.40
in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without any interest thereon (the
"Merger Consideration").

  

  

(b) Each share of common stock, par value one cent ($0.01) per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall continue as one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(c) All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as
treasury stock and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective
Time, be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

(d) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall
be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders
immediately prior to the Effective Time of shares of outstanding Company
Common Stock not represented by certificates ("Book Entry Shares") and the
holders of certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented shares of outstanding Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") in
each case shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon transfer of such
Book Entry Shares or delivery of such Certificates in accordance with Section
3.2, the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each such
share of Company Common Stock held by them.

  

  

  

Section 3.2 Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares.

  

  

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deliver, in trust, to a bank or
trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company
(the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares of
Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and (ii)
Dissenting Shares), sufficient funds for timely payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration (such cash hereinafter referred to as "Consideration
Fund").

  

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book Entry Shares whose
shares of

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a): (i) a letter of transmittal, in
customary form, that shall specify that delivery of such Certificates or
transfer of such Book Entry Shares shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as applicable,
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof together with any required indemnity) or transfer of the
Book Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Book Entry
Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the form and
substance of which letter of transmittal and instructions shall be
substantially as reasonably agreed to by the Company and Parent and prepared
prior to the Closing. Upon receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent
in connection with the transfer of a Book Entry Share or surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, in each case together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and with such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Book Entry Share or
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any
required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this Article III, and the Book Entry Share so transferred or
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid to holders of Book Entry Shares or Certificates in connection with, or
accrued on, the Merger Consideration. If any Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than a Person in whose name the Book Entry Share
transferred or Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it
shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange
shall present proper evidence of transfer and pay to the Paying Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Book Entry
Share transferred or Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable.

  

  

(c) The Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that no investment
of the Consideration Fund shall have maturities that could prevent or delay
payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Earnings on the Consideration
Fund in excess of the amounts payable to Company stockholders shall be the
sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall
be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. No
investment of the Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
Article III, and following any net losses from any such investment, Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of
the applicable holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will
be deemed to be part of the Consideration Fund.

  

  

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Article III, except as otherwise provided by
Law.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the applicable former
stockholders of the Company one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holders of Certificates or Book
Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article III with
respect to such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger
Consideration in respect thereof (if any).

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Consideration
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book Entry Share shall
not have been surrendered or transferred prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect
of such Certificate or Book Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any
holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Share who has not theretofore
complied with this Article III with respect thereto shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger
Consideration in respect thereof (if any).

  

  

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount
as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such
Person is entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Article
III.

  

  

Section 3.3 Shares of Dissenting Stockholders.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, other than as
provided in Section 3.3(b), any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
stockholder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

unless and until such stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) such stockholder's right to obtain
payment of the fair value of such stockholder's Dissenting Shares under the
DGCL, but shall instead be entitled only to such rights with respect to such
Dissenting Shares as may be granted to such stockholder under the DGCL. From
and after the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to vote
for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other
distributions (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders
of record prior to the Effective Time). The Company shall promptly provide any
notices of dissent or demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock to Parent, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to each such dissent or demand.
Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make
any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such dissent or
demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any payments required to be made
with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be made by Parent.

  

  

(b) If any stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or
loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such stockholder's right to
obtain payment of the fair value of such stockholder's Dissenting Shares under
the DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of
such effective withdrawal or loss, such stockholder's shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and, if the occurrence of such
effective withdrawal or loss is later than the Effective Time, shall be
treated as if they had as of the Effective Time been converted into the right
to receive Merger Consideration, without interest, as set forth in Section
3.1(a).

  

  

Section 3.4 Treatment of Stock Options; ESPP.

  

  

(a) Subject to consummation of the Merger, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock,
whether or not vested or exercisable prior to or as a result of the
consummation of the Merger (the "Company Stock Options"), shall be accelerated
in full so that each such Company Stock Option becomes fully vested and
exercisable. Subject to consummation of the Merger, at the Effective Time,
each Company Stock Option outstanding, without regard to the identity of the
holder, as of such time shall be cancelled and each such Company Stock Option
that has a per share exercise price lower than the Merger Consideration shall
be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less
applicable withholding) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that would have been issuable upon
exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (y) the Merger Consideration less the per share exercise price of such
Company Stock Option. For the avoidance of doubt, no amount shall be payable
in respect of Company Stock Options with an exercise price per share in excess
of the Merger Consideration.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all corporate or other
actions (including obtaining any required consents from holders of outstanding
Company Stock Options) necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company
Stock Options as contemplated by this Section 3.4 and to ensure that neither
any holder of Company Stock Options, nor any other participant in any Company
Equity Plan, shall have any right thereunder to acquire any securities of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, or to receive any payment or
benefit with respect to any award previously granted under the Company Equity
Plans, except as provided in this Section 3.4. All amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 3.4 shall be paid without interest.

  

  

(c) The Company's ESPP shall continue to be operated in accordance with its
terms and past practice for the current Purchase Period (as defined in the
ESPP) (the "Purchase Period"); provided that if the Closing is expected to
occur prior to the end of the current Purchase Period, the Company shall take
action to provide for an earlier Purchase Date (as defined in the ESPP) in
accordance with Section 15 of the ESPP. Such earlier Purchase Date shall be as
close to the Closing Date as is administratively practicable, and the Company
shall notify each participant in writing, at least ten (10) days prior to the
earlier Purchase Date, that the Purchase Date for his or her option (including
for purposes of determining the Purchase Price (as defined in the ESPP) of
such option) has been changed to the earlier Purchase Date and that his or her
option will be exercised automatically on the earlier Purchase Date, unless
prior to such date he or she has withdrawn from the Purchase Period as
provided in Section 12 of the ESPP. The Company shall suspend the commencement
of any future Purchase Periods under the ESPP unless and until this Agreement
is terminated and shall terminate the ESPP as of the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 3.5 Withholding Tax. Each of Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from the
consideration payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
required to be deducted or withheld with respect to such payment under the
Code or any other applicable Tax Law. If Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, so withholds
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, made such
deduction or withholding.

  

  

Section 3.6 Tax Treatment. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree and
acknowledge that the Merger will be treated as a taxable purchase of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration (and
not as a "reorganization", within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code)
for United States federal income Tax purposes.

nature) (such reports and documents, the "Filed SEC Reports") and, subject to
Section 9.4, except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  

  

Section 4.1 Organization. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a
corporation or other entity duly organized and validly existing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has the requisite
entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure
to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent a copy of
its amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the "Company Charter")
and bylaws (the "Company Bylaws"), and the organizational documents of each of
its Subsidiaries, in each case, as currently in effect, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of its
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents.

  

  

Section 4.2 Capitalization.

  

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 50,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock, par value one cent ($0.01) per share, of which
16,585,394 are issued and outstanding as of July 8, 2010 and (ii) 1,000,000
shares are preferred stock, par value one cent ($0.01) per share, none of
which are issued or outstanding on the date of this Agreement. All of the
outstanding shares of the Company's capital stock are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights. As of the
date hereof, other than pursuant to the Company Equity Plans and the ESPP,
there are no existing (i) options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or other
rights, convertible securities, agreements or commitments of any character
obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell
any shares of capital stock or other equity interest in, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) contractual obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) voting trusts or similar
agreements to which the Company is a party with respect to the voting of the
capital stock of the Company.

(b) Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list, as of June 30, 2010, of all outstanding Company Stock
Options, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto, the
grant dates, expiration dates, exercise or base prices (if applicable) and
vesting schedules thereof and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
individually identifying information regarding the holders thereof. All
Company Stock Options are evidenced by stock option agreements or other award
agreements, in each case, in the forms set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, other than differences with respect to the number
of shares covered thereby, the exercise price, regular vesting schedule and
expiration date applicable thereto and, except for such differences, no stock
option agreement, restricted stock agreement or other award agreement contains
material terms that are inconsistent with, or in addition to, such forms. Each
grant of Company Stock Options was duly authorized no later than the date on
which the grant of such Company Stock Option was by its terms to be effective
(the "Grant Date") by all necessary corporate action, including, as
applicable, approval by the Company Board (or a duly constituted and
authorized committee thereof) and any required stockholder approval by the
necessary number of votes or written consents; the award agreement governing
such grant (if any) was (i) duly executed and delivered by each party thereto
or (ii) granted subject to customary electronic acknowledgement; such grant
was made in accordance with the terms of the applicable compensation plan or
arrangement of the Company, the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws,
including the Securities Exchange Rules; the per share exercise price of each
grant of Company Stock Options was equal to the fair market value (within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code, in the case of each Company Stock Option
intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option", and within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code, in the case of each other Company Stock Option) of a
share of Company Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date; and such grant was
properly accounted for in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements
(including the related notes) of the Company and disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports in accordance with the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws.
Each Company Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option"
under Section 422 of the Code, if any, so qualifies. As of the close of
business on July 8, 2010, there were outstanding Company Stock Options to
purchase 3,802,880 shares of Company Common Stock with exercise prices on a
per share basis lower than the Merger Consideration, and the weighted average
exercise price of such Company Stock Options was equal to $12.1912. Each
Company Stock Option may, by its terms, be treated at the Effective Time as
set forth in Section 3.4(a). There are no Company Restricted Stock Units
outstanding.

  

  

(c) Section 4.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists as of the date
hereof each of the Subsidiaries of the Company and, for each Subsidiary, the
address and jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of such Subsidiary.

  

  

(d) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or equivalent equity
interests of each of the Company's Subsidiaries are owned of record and
beneficially, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all
material liens, pledges, security interests or other encumbrances. There are
no (i) outstanding options or other rights of any kind which

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or deliver any shares
of capital stock, voting securities or other equity interests of any such
Subsidiary or any securities or obligations convertible into or exchangeable
into or exercisable for any shares of capital stock, voting securities or
other equity interests of a Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) outstanding
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any securities or obligations convertible into or
exchangeable into or exercisable for any shares of capital stock, voting
securities or other equity interests of a Subsidiary of the Company or (iii)
other options, calls, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock
of any Company Subsidiary to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party.

  

  

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries own any interest or
investment (whether equity or debt) in any corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other entity, other than a Subsidiary of the Company.

  

  

Section 4.3 Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Company Action. The Company
has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and, subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, to
consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by the Company Board and, except for
the Company Stockholder Approval, no other corporate action on the part of the
Company is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of
this Agreement and the consummation by it of the Transactions. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due and
valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent and Merger Sub,
is a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent
conveyance, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and (ii) the remedy of
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be
subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which
any proceeding therefor may be brought.

  

  

Section 4.4 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance by the Company of
this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions will
not, (i) violate any provision of the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws,
(ii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due
notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions
or provisions of any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets is
bound, (iii) violate any Law applicable to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets or (iv) other than (A) the
filing of the Certificate of Merger, (B) filings required by and the
expiration of applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and other
Antitrust Laws, (C) applicable requirements

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

of the Securities Exchange Rules, (D) the filing of customary applications and
notices, as applicable, with the United States Food and Drug Administration
(the "FDA"), Medicare/Medicaid, federal and state insurance and other federal,
state or foreign Governmental Entities with jurisdiction over the provision of
health care items or services, medical devices, insurance and risk sharing
arrangements and products and services, third-party administrator approvals,
in each case, to the extent applicable (the "Healthcare Regulatory Approvals")
and (E) applicable requirements of and filings with the SEC under the Exchange
Act, require the Company to make any filing or registration with or
notification to, or require the Company to obtain any authorization, consent
or approval of, any court, legislative, executive or regulatory authority or
agency (a "Governmental Entity"); except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii)
and (iv), for such violations, breaches or defaults that, or filings,
registrations, notifications, authorizations, consents or approvals the
failure of which to make or obtain, (1) would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
to prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the Company's
ability to consummate the Merger or any of the other Transactions, or (2)
would occur or be required as a result of the business or activities in which
Parent or Merger Sub is or proposes to be engaged or as a result of any acts
or omissions by, or the status of any facts pertaining to, Parent or Merger
Sub.

  

  

Section 4.5 SEC Reports; Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

  

  

(a) The Company has filed all reports and other documents with the SEC
required to be filed by the Company since April 1, 2008 (the "Company SEC
Reports"). As of their respective filing dates, the Company SEC Reports (i)
complied in all material respects with, to the extent in effect at the time of
filing, the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each of the financial statements (including the
related notes) of the Company included in the Company SEC Reports complied at
the time it was filed as to form in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto in effect at the time of such filing, was prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the
rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to normal year-end adjustments). Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has been
no change in the Company's accounting policies or the methods of making
accounting estimates or changes in estimates that are material to the
Company's financial statements, except as described in the Filed SEC Reports
or after the date hereof as may be required by GAAP or applicable Law.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(b) Since April 1, 2008, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has had in
place "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) reasonably designed and
maintained to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports. The Company maintains "internal controls over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (a)
transactions are executed only in accordance with management's authorization,
(b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets,
(c) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
authorization, and (d) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with
the existing assets at reasonable intervals to prevent or timely detect the
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that could have a material effect on the Company's financial
statements. There is no (x) "significant deficiency" or (y) "material
weakness" in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that the
Company's independent accountants certify has not been appropriately and
adequately remedied by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings
assigned to them in Release 2004-001 of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, as in effect on the date hereof. The Company has complied and
is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable certification,
internal control and other requirements and provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

  

Section 4.6 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for (a) liabilities and
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since March 31, 2010
(the "Balance Sheet Date"), (b) liabilities and obligations incurred in
connection with the Merger or otherwise as contemplated by this Agreement, (c)
performance obligations pursuant to the terms of the Contracts set forth in
Section 4.8 or 4.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (d) liabilities
and obligations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party
to, any Partnership or any similar Contract or arrangement where the result,
purpose or intended effect thereof is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Company's or such Subsidiary's financial statements or in
the Company SEC Reports.

(b) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of

26  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

Governmental Entity with respect to, termination proceedings or other claims

or agents has engaged in any transaction or acted in a manner, or failed to
act in a manner, that would reasonably be expected to subject the Company or

(i) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the
Company Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the Merger or any other
Transaction (whether alone or as a result of any termination of employment on
or following the Effective Time) will, except as expressly contemplated by
this Agreement, (A) entitle any Participant to severance, termination,
retention, change in control or similar compensation or benefits, (B)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of, compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant

deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the
Code (a "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan") subject to Section 409A of
the Code was, as of January 1, 2005, in good faith compliance with Section

27  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

then applicable guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service thereunder
(together, the "409A Authorities"). Since December 31, 2008, each Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan has remained in documentary and operational
compliance with the 409A Authorities. No Participant is entitled to any gross-
up, make-whole or other additional payment from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax (including federal, state, local or foreign
income, excise or other Taxes (including Taxes imposed under Sections 280G and
409A of the Code)) or interest or penalty related thereto.

  

  

(l) Other than payments or benefits that may be made to the Persons listed in
Section 4.9(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no amount or other
entitlement or economic benefit that could be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) as a result of the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the obtaining of the Company Stockholder Approval or the
consummation of the Merger or any other Transaction (alone or in combination
with any other event, including as a result of termination of employment on or
following the Effective Time) by or for the benefit of any Person who is a
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)

such Foreign Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to affect such
approval or status. None of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any Commonly
Controlled Entity has obligations under any Benefit Plan to provide health or
other welfare benefits to retirees or former employees for which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries reasonably would be expected to have any material
liability.

Subsidiaries that is a defined benefit retirement plan, to the extent the
liabilities of the Companies and any of its Subsidiaries with respect to such
plan exceed the related assets of the Company and such Subsidiaries with
respect to such plan, such that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could
have any material liability with respect to the underfunding of such plan,
either (A) the excess of such liabilities over such assets with respect to
such plan has been properly accrued on the consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP, (B) such
liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been disclosed in
Section 4.9(n) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or (C) Parent or Merger Sub
has been provided the most recent actuarial valuation report with respect to
such plan; and (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with all applicable Laws as they pertain to statutory plans
applicable to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries.

respectively.

  

  

(b) None of the Company, any of the Company's Subsidiaries, any of their
respective officers or employees, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
supplier, distributor, licensee or agent or any other Person acting on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, has (i)

and reporting requirements of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting
Act of 1970, as amended, the money laundering statutes of all jurisdictions,
the rules and regulations thereunder and any related or similar rules,

respect to the Money Laundering Laws is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is any

(a) Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of July
6, 2010, a complete and accurate list of all Registered Intellectual Property
owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, specifying in respect of each
such item, as applicable: the owner of the item; the jurisdictions in which
the item is registered, or in which any application for registration has been
filed; the respective registration, publication or application number of the
item; and the date of application, publication or registration of the item.
All patents and patent applications listed in Section 4.12(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule are owned by, or are subject to an obligation of
assignment to, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries free and clear of all
pledges, liens (other than (i) outbound licenses under Company Intellectual
Property set forth on Section 4.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and
(ii) sales and distribution Contracts and their associated product licenses
entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice)
and security interests. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (1) the
patent applications listed in Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule are pending, have not been abandoned, and have been and continue to
be timely prosecuted; (2) all Registered Intellectual Property owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been duly registered and/or filed with
or issued by each appropriate Governmental Entity in the jurisdiction
indicated in Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and all
related necessary affidavits of continuing use, renewals and maintenance have
been timely filed, and all related necessary maintenance fees have been timely
paid to continue all such rights in effect; (3) none of the patents listed in
Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule has expired or been
declared invalid, in whole or in part, by any Governmental Entity; (4) the
registered trademarks and trademark applications listed in Section 4.12(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule are in full force and effect and have not
lapsed, been abandoned or forfeited in whole or in part; and (5) none of the
Trademarks listed in Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule is the
subject of any ongoing oppositions, cancellations or other legal proceedings.
None of the patents or patent applications listed in Section 4.12(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule is the subject of any ongoing interferences,
oppositions, reissues, reexaminations or other proceedings, including ex parte
and post-grant proceedings, in the United States Patent and Trademark Office
or in any other patent office or similar administrative agency. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no published patents, published patent
applications, articles or other prior art that could adversely affect the
validity of any patent listed in Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule in a material way. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
each of the patents and patent applications listed in Section 4.12(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each and every inventor of the claims
thereof to the extent required by the Laws of the jurisdiction in which such
patent is issued or such patent application is pending. Each inventor named on
the patents and patent applications listed in Section 4.12(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule has executed an agreement assigning his, her or its entire
right, title and interest in and to such patent or patent application, and the
inventions embodied and claimed therein, to the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company (or, in the case of any such patents or patent applications acquired
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any third party, to the
Knowledge of the Company, to such third party to the extent that such rights
would not automatically vest with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by
operation of Law or

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

otherwise). To the Knowledge of the Company, no such inventor has any
contractual or other obligation that would preclude any such assignment or
otherwise conflict with the obligations of such inventor to the Company or
such Subsidiary under such agreement with the Company or such Subsidiary.

  

  

(b) Section 4.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
(x) all Contracts under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries licenses
from or to a third party material Intellectual Property (other than software
licenses for generally available software) and (y) all Contracts that provide
for co-existence arrangements with respect to any Intellectual Property,
including covenants not to sue, in each case, that are used in the conduct of
the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted
(such Contracts being referred to as "License Contracts"). To the Knowledge of
the Company, (i) each License Contract is valid and in full force and effect;
(ii) each License Contract will continue to be valid and in full force and
effect on similar terms immediately following the consummation of the
Transactions; and (iii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
material breach of any License Contract, except to the extent that the failure
of any of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) to be true and correct
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has no Knowledge that (A) any of
the patents or patent applications licensed to the Company under any License
Contract does not identify each and every inventor of the claims thereof to
the extent required by the Laws of the jurisdiction in which such patent is
issued or such patent application is pending or (B) any inventor named on the
patents and patent applications licensed to the Company under any License
Contract has not executed an agreement assigning his, her or its entire right,
title and interest in and to such patent or patent application, and the
inventions embodied and claimed therein, to the licensor of such patent or
patent application, except to the extent that the failure of any of the
foregoing clauses (A) or (B) to be true and correct would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

(c) One or more of the Company and its Subsidiaries owns, licenses or
otherwise has the right to use all material Intellectual Property used in the
conduct of the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted (the "Company Intellectual Property"). The Company Intellectual
Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is free and clear of
all pledges, liens (other than (i) outbound licenses under Company
Intellectual Property set forth on Section 4.12(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and (ii) sales and distribution Contracts and their associated
product licenses entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice) and security interests.

  

  

(d) To the Company's Knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has infringed or is infringing (including with respect to the
development, clinical testing, manufacture, distribution, marketing, use or
sale by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of their respective products or
of their respective Intellectual Property) the rights of any Person with
regard to any Intellectual Property in a manner which, individually or in the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

aggregate, has resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in a
material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no
pending action, claim, suit or proceeding in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has alleged that any Person or Persons has infringed or is or are
infringing any Company Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(e) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
action, claim, suit or proceeding in which it is alleged that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has infringed or otherwise violated, or is infringing
or otherwise violating, the Intellectual Property rights of any third party
(including with respect to the manufacture, use, distribution, marketing, or
sale by the Company or its Subsidiaries of any products or to the operations
of the Company or its Subsidiaries) nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is
any governmental investigation alleging any such infringement or violation
pending or threatened. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written claim during the past
three (3) years alleging any such infringement or violation, except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(f) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially
reasonable efforts to protect and preserve their respective rights in all
Company Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
including requiring all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
execute a confidentiality agreement with respect to such Company Intellectual
Property. To the Company's Knowledge, all Persons who have created Company
Intellectual Property (other than Company Intellectual Property that is
licensed to the Company) have assigned to one or more of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (or, in the case of any such patents or patent applications
acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any third party, to
such third party) all of their rights therein, to the extent that such rights
would not automatically vest with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by
operation of Law or otherwise.

  

  

(g) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, obligations for payment of
monies currently due and payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with any option, right, license or interest relating to
Intellectual Property (i) granted to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or (ii) granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any other Person
(including any obligations of such other Person to make any fixed or
contingent payments, including royalty payments), have been satisfied in a
timely manner.

  

  

(h) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation by the Company
of the Transactions and compliance by the Company with the provisions of this
Agreement will not,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of,
or result in, termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
to the loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any lien in or
upon, any Intellectual Property right.

financial statements (in accordance with GAAP) adequate to reflect such Taxes.
Following the date hereof, (i) no Audits of the Company or any of its

(d) Section 4.13(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of each United States federal and state income Tax Return of the

Section 4.18 Regulatory Compliance.

  

  

(a) The businesses of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being
conducted in compliance with all Laws, including (i) the federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act, as amended (including the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the "FDCA"); (ii) federal Medicare and Medicaid statutes and
related state or local statutes or regulations; (iii) any comparable foreign
Laws for any of the foregoing, including laws and regulations promulgated
under the Medical Device Directive in the European Union (the "MDD"); (iv)
federal or state criminal or civil Laws (including the federal Anti-Kickback
Statute (42 U.S.C. §1320a-7(b)), Stark Law (42 U.S.C. §1395nn), False Claims
Act (42 U.S.C. §1320a-7b(a)), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996 (42 U.S.C. §1320d et. seq., and any comparable state or local
Laws) and (v) state licensing, disclosure and reporting requirements, except
in the case of clauses (i) through (v) above as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

(b) All pre-clinical and clinical investigations conducted or sponsored by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries are being conducted in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws administered or issued by the
applicable Regulatory Authorities, including (i) FDA standards for conducting
non-clinical laboratory studies contained in Title 21 part 58 of the Code of

clinical trials contained in Title 21 parts 50, 54, 56, 812 and 820 of the
Code of Federal Regulations, and (iii) applicable federal and state Laws
restricting the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health
information. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written information from the FDA or any agency of a European Union Member
State with jurisdiction over the marketing, sale, use handling and control,
safety, efficacy, reliability, or manufacturing of medical devices which would
reasonably be expected to lead to the denial of any application for marketing
approval currently pending before the FDA or such other Regulatory Authority.

  

  

(c) All material reports, documents, claims, permits and notices required to
be filed, maintained or furnished to the FDA or any other Regulatory Authority
by the Company and its Subsidiaries have been so filed, maintained or
furnished. All such reports, documents, claims, permits and notices were
complete and accurate in all material respects on the date filed (or were
corrected in or supplemented by a subsequent filing) such that no liability
exists with respect to such filing. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any officer, employee,
agent or distributor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has made an
untrue statement of a material fact or a fraudulent statement to the FDA or
any other Regulatory Authority, failed to disclose a material fact required to
be disclosed to the FDA or any other Regulatory Authority, or committed an
act, made a statement, or failed to make a statement that, at the time such
disclosure was made, would reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the
FDA or any other Regulatory Authority to invoke its policy respecting "Fraud,
Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities", set
forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991) or any similar policy.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any officer, employee, agent or distributor of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, has been convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct
for which debarment is mandated by 21 U.S.C. § 335a(a) or any similar Law or
authorized by 21 U.S.C. § 335a(b) or any similar Law. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any officer,
employee, agent or distributor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has
been convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct for which such Person
could be excluded from participating in the federal health care programs under
Section 1128 of the Social Security Act of 1935, as amended, or any similar
Law.

  

  

(d) As to each product or product candidate subject to the FDCA and the
regulations of the FDA promulgated thereunder, the MDD or similar Law in any
foreign jurisdiction that is or has been developed, manufactured, tested,
distributed and/or marketed by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each such product or product candidate, a "Medical Device"),
each such Medical Device is being or has been developed, manufactured, tested,
distributed and/or marketed in compliance with all applicable requirements
under the FDCA and the regulations of the FDA promulgated thereunder, the MDD
and similar Laws, including those relating to investigational use, premarket
clearance or marketing approval to market a Medical Device, good manufacturing
practices, good clinical practices, good laboratory practices, labeling,
advertising, record keeping, filing of reports and security, except

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries (i) since April 1, 2008 and prior to the date hereof, has
received any FDA Form 483, notice of adverse finding, notices, untitled
letters or other correspondence or notice from the FDA or any other Regulatory
Authority and to the Company's Knowledge there is no action or proceeding

fine, debarment, suspension or recall), in each case (A) contesting the
investigational device exemption, premarket clearance or approval of, the uses
of or the labeling or promotion of any Medical Device or (B) otherwise
alleging any material violation applicable to any Medical Device by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Law or Permit and (ii) following the
date hereof, will have received any FDA Form 483, or any such notice, letters
or other correspondence and to the Company's Knowledge there is no such action

behalf of, the Company or its Subsidiaries, or in which the Company or its
Subsidiaries have participated. Following the date hereof, the Company and its
Subsidiaries will have not received any such notices, correspondence or other
communication, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(g) Since April 1, 2008, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not either
voluntarily or involuntarily initiated, conducted or issued, or caused to be
initiated, conducted or issued, any recall, field notifications, field
corrections, market withdrawal or replacement, safety alert, warning, "dear
doctor" letter, investigator notice, safety alert or other notice or action
relating to an alleged lack of safety, efficacy or regulatory compliance of
any product. The Company and its Subsidiaries are not aware of any facts which
are reasonably likely to cause (i) the recall, market withdrawal or
replacement of any product sold or intended to be sold by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) a change in the marketing classification or a material
change in the labeling of any such products, or (iii) a termination or
suspension of the marketing of such products.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(h) To the Company's Knowledge, no data generated by the Company or any of its

(j) No product manufactured and/or distributed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is (i) adulterated within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. § 351 (or any
similar Law), (ii) misbranded within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. § 352 (or any
similar Law) or (iii) a product that is in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 360 or
360e (or any similar Law), except as would not, individually or in the

of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the approval and

time such Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first

material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

any of its Subsidiaries that Parent furnishes to the Company in writing

would reasonably be expected to (x) adversely affect the Company and its

in any material respect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or (z) prevent or

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
Transactions;

  

  

(xiii) except as required by applicable Law, (A) pay, discharge, settle or
satisfy any claims, liabilities, obligations or litigation (absolute, accrued,
asserted or unasserted, contingent or otherwise), other than the payment,
discharge, settlement or satisfaction in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice or in accordance with their terms, of

reserves) or incurred since the date of such financial statements in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (B) cancel any

(xv) enter into any Contract, agreement, commitment or arrangement to do any
of the foregoing.

  

  

Section 6.2 Advice of Changes; Filings. The Company and Parent shall promptly
advise the other party orally and in writing of (a) any representation or
warranty made by it (and, in the case of Parent, made by Merger Sub) contained
in this Agreement becoming untrue or (b) the failure of it (and, in the case
of Parent, of Merger Sub) to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
(and, in the case of Parent, of Merger Sub) under this Agreement; provided,
however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement. The Company and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by Law,
promptly

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

provide the other with copies of all filings made by such party (and, in the
case of Parent, by Merger Sub) with any Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, other than the portions
of such filings that include confidential information not directly related to
the Transactions.

  

  

Section 6.3 Access to Information. From and after the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to
officers, employees, counsel, investment bankers, accountants and other
authorized representatives ("Representatives") of Parent and Merger Sub
reasonable access, in a manner not disruptive to the operations of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to such Representatives all information
concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in each case as may reasonably be requested; provided, however,
that nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
disclose any information to Parent or Merger Sub if such disclosure would, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) violate applicable Law or the
provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or (ii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege;
provided further, however, that nothing herein shall authorize Parent or its
Representatives to undertake any environmental investigations or sampling at
any of the properties owned, operated or leased by the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Parent agrees that it will not, and will cause its
Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section
6.3 for any competitive or other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
Transactions. The Confidentiality Agreement shall apply with respect to
information furnished hereunder by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the
Company's Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement).

  

  

Section 6.4 Board Recommendation; Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company will not, nor shall
it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
respective officers, directors, employees and other Representatives to,
directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit, or take any action to facilitate
or encourage, or participate or engage in any negotiations, inquiries or
discussions with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) in connection with
any potential Acquisition Proposal, disclose or furnish any information or
data to any Person or afford any Person other than Parent or its
Representatives access to its properties, books, or records, except as
required by Law or pursuant to a governmental request for information, (iii)
enter into or execute, or propose to enter into or execute, any agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) approve, endorse, recommend or
make or authorize any public statement, recommendation, or solicitation in
support of any Acquisition Proposal or any offer or proposal relating to an
Acquisition Proposal other than with respect to the Merger. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 6.4(a) by the Company. The Company will, and will direct its
Representatives to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
discussions and negotiations with any Person regarding any proposal that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal and (B) promptly after the date hereof request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously provided to any such
Person(s) within the last twelve (12) months for the purpose of evaluating a
possible Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
the event that the Company receives a bona fide written unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that did not result from a breach
of this Section 6.4, the Company and the Company Board may participate in
discussions or negotiations (including, as a part thereof, making any
counterproposal) with, or furnish any information to, any Person or Persons
(but only after any such Person or Persons enter into a customary
confidentiality agreement with the Company which may not provide for an
exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and may not restrict the Company
from complying with this Section 6.4) making such contact or making such
Acquisition Proposal and their respective Representatives and potential
sources of financing, if prior to Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that such Person or Persons have submitted to the
Company an Acquisition Proposal that is, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal or (ii) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with counsel, that the failure to participate in
such discussions or negotiations or to furnish such information would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law; provided that all such
information so furnished has been previously provided to Parent or is provided
to Parent substantially concurrent with it being so furnished to such Person
or its Representatives. In addition, nothing herein shall restrict the Company
from complying with its disclosure obligations with regard to any Acquisition
Proposal under applicable Law.

  

  

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, the
financial and other material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition
Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making
any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent fully
informed of the status and material details (including any change to the terms
thereof) of any such Acquisition Proposal and any substantive discussions and
any negotiations concerning the material terms and conditions thereof and (ii)
provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and
other written material (including all draft agreements and any comments
thereon) relating to any such Acquisition Proposal exchanged between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or their Representatives), on the one
hand, and the Person making an Acquisition Proposal (or its Representatives),
on the other hand.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(d) Subject to Sections 6.4(e) and 6.4(f), neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (A)(i) withdraw (or modify in
a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or propose publicly to withdraw (or
so modify), the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt, or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve, adopt, or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) in the event of a tender offer or exchange offer
for any outstanding Company Common Stock, fail to recommend against acceptance
of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company's stockholders within
ten (10) Business Days of the commencement thereof (for the avoidance of
doubt, the taking of no position or a neutral position by the Company Board in
respect of the acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer by its
stockholders shall constitute a failure to recommend against any such offer)
(any action described in clauses (i)-(iii) being referred to as a "Change of
Recommendation") or (B) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve
or recommend, or allow the Company to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement, or other agreement, arrangement, or understanding (i) constituting
or related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) requiring it to abandon, terminate, or
fail to consummate the Transactions.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, if the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law
(x) make a Change of Recommendation or (y) in response to a Superior Proposal
that was not solicited after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from
a breach of this Section 6.4, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
and concurrently with or after such termination, cause the Company to enter
into an acquisition agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal; provided,
however, that no Change of Recommendation may be made that relates to an
Acquisition Proposal unless such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and; provided further that (1) no Change of Recommendation may be
made and (2) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.4(e)
may be made, in each case until after the fifth (5th) Business Day following
Parent's receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the
Company Board intends to make a Change of Recommendation (a "Notice of Adverse
Recommendation") or terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.4(e)
(a "Notice of Superior Proposal") and specifying the reasons therefor,
including, if the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board is a
Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any
other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Adverse Recommendation or Notice of Superior Proposal and a new five (5)
Business Day period). The Company agrees that, during the five (5) Business
Day period prior to (i) the Company Board making a Change of Recommendation or
(ii) the termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to this Section
6.4(e), the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with
Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Parent. In determining whether to make a Change of Recommendation or to cause
the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.4(e), the
Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of Adverse
Recommendation, a Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise.

  

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company's stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer by a third party
or from taking any action or making any disclosure required by applicable Law.

  

  

Section 6.5 Employee Benefits.

  

  

(a) With respect to the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who are
employed primarily in the United States, as of the Effective Time, and for a
period of at least twelve (12) months thereafter, Parent agrees to (i) provide
or cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to provide
each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed
by the Company or the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time (each, an
"Affected Employee" and collectively, the "Affected Employees") with base
salary or wage rates that are not less than that in effect for such Affected
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) either (A) maintain
or cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to maintain
the material Benefit Plans (other than the Company Equity Plans and ESPP) at
the benefit levels in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (B)
provide or cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to
provide employee benefits (excluding any equity-based compensation, defined
benefit pensions or retiree medical benefits) that are no less favorable to
each Affected Employee, in the aggregate, than those in effect for such
Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following the
Effective Time, Parent shall have the sole discretion with respect to the
participation of any Affected Employee in any plans or arrangements providing
for the issuance of shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock
appreciation rights or other rights in respect of any shares of capital stock
of any entity or any securities convertible or exchangeable into such shares
pursuant to any such plans or arrangements.

  

  

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall provide,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, that periods of
employment with the Company (including any current or former Affiliate of the
Company or any predecessor of the Company) shall be taken into account (i) for
purposes of vesting (but not benefit accrual) under Parent's defined benefit
pension plan, (ii) for purposes of eligibility for vacation under Parent's
vacation program, (iii) for purposes of eligibility under any health or
welfare plan maintained by Parent (other than any post-employment health or
post-employment welfare plan) and Parent's 401(k) plan and (iv) unless covered
under another arrangement with or of

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

   
 

the Company, for benefit accrual purposes under Parent's severance plan (in
the case of each of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), solely to the extent
that Parent makes such plan or program available to employees of the Surviving
Corporation and not in any case where credit would result in duplication of
benefits), but not for purposes of any other employee benefit plan of Parent.
Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, (A) reduce any period of limitation on
health benefits coverage of Affected Employees due to pre-existing conditions
(or actively at work or similar requirements) under the applicable health
benefits plan of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent by the number of days of an
individual's "creditable coverage", to the extent required by Section 701 of
ERISA, (B) waive any and all eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements with respect to such Affected Employees to the
extent such eligibility waiting periods or evidence of insurability
requirements were waived with respect to the Affected Employees under the
Benefits Plans and (C) credit each Affected Employee with all deductible
payments, out-of-pocket or other co-payments paid by such employee under the
health benefit plans of the Company or its Affiliates prior to the Closing
Date during the year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of
determining the extent to which any such employee has satisfied his or her
deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under
any health benefit plan of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent for such year. The
Merger shall not affect any Affected Employee's accrual of, or right to take,
any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation policies applicable to such
Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this
Agreement shall confer upon any Affected Employee any right to continue in the
employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby
expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Affected
Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.

  

  

(c) With respect to Affected Employees who are employed primarily outside the
United States, following the Effective Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall
provide such employees with employee benefits in accordance with applicable
Law.

  

  

(d) This Section 6.5 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section
6.5, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section
6.5. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans, programs, policies,
arrangements, agreements or understandings. Furthermore, no provision of this
Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting the ability of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate any plans,
programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings of Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation and nothing therein shall be construed as
an amendment to any such plan, program, policy, arrangement, agreement or
understanding for any purpose.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

Section 6.6 Publicity. The initial press release by each of Parent and the
Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be acceptable to
Parent and the Company. Neither the Company nor Parent (nor any of their
respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make any other
public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without
the prior agreement of the other party, except as may be required by Law or by
any Securities Exchange Rule, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public announcement shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before making
any such public announcements; provided that the Company will no longer be
required to obtain the prior agreement of or consult with Parent in connection
with any such press release or public announcement if the Company Board has
effected a Change of Recommendation or in connection with any such press
release or public announcement pursuant to Section 6.4(f).

  

  

Section 6.7 Directors' and Officers' Insurance and Indemnification.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, assume the obligations with respect to all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Company
Charter, Company Bylaws or any indemnification agreement between an
Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, as
in effect on the date hereof or as amended or entered into prior to the
Effective Time with the consent of Parent), without further action, as of the
Effective Time and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. The
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and advancement of
expenses set forth in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws as amended,
restated and in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such
modification is required by Law.

  

  

(b) Parent shall obtain, at the Effective Time, a prepaid (or "tail")
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six (6) years from
the Effective Time, covering each person currently covered by the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (a complete and accurate
copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) (collectively, the
"Insured Parties") on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement;
provided, however, that in satisfying its obligations under this Section
6.7(b), Parent shall not be obligated to pay more than $700,000 in the
aggregate to obtain such policy. It is understood and agreed that in the event
such a policy cannot be obtained for $700,000 or less in the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

   
 

aggregate, Parent shall be obligated to obtain as much coverage for not less
than six (6) years from the Effective Time as may be obtained for such
$700,000 aggregate amount.

  

  

(c) This Section 6.7 is intended to benefit the Insured Parties and the
Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors, assigns and transferees of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or their respective successors or assigns, as the case may be,
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

  

  

Section 6.8 State Takeover Laws. The Company Board shall take all action
reasonably necessary to render any "control share acquisition", "fair price",
"business combination" or other anti-takeover Law that becomes or is deemed to
be applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, the Merger or any other
Transaction, inapplicable to the foregoing.

  

  

  

Section 6.9 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto agree to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act and to make all other filings required by applicable
foreign Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event prior to the expiration of any applicable legal
deadline (provided that the filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant
to the HSR Act will be made within ten (10) Business Days after the date of
this Agreement) and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, or any other federal, state or foreign law,
regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for
the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or the
significant impediment of effective competition (collectively "Antitrust
Laws"). The parties shall also consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
filings or other submissions made or submitted by or on behalf of any party
hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any such Antitrust
Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) keep the other party informed of
any material communication received by such party from, or given by such party
to, any Governmental Entity and of any material

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

   
 

communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case relating to the Transactions and (ii) provide each other
with copies of all material written communications to or from any Governmental
Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws (including any analyses, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals submitted to any such
Governmental Entity). Any such disclosures or provision of copies by one party
to the other may be made on an outside counsel basis if appropriate. Nothing
in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent to agree to, or proffer
to, divest or hold separate any assets or any portion of any business of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, and except with regard to the Antitrust Laws
which shall be governed by Section 6.9(a), the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall, and Parent and the Company shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, each use their commercially reasonable efforts to:

  

  

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Transactions as
promptly as reasonably practicable;

  

  

(ii) obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders and
send any notices, in each case, which are required to be obtained, made or
sent by the Company or Parent or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with
the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions; provided that in connection therewith none
of the Company or its Subsidiaries will be required to (nor, without the prior
written consent of Parent, will) make or agree to make any payment or accept
any material conditions or obligations, including amendments to existing
conditions and obligations;

  

  

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings and
notifications, and thereafter make any other submissions and applications with
respect to this Agreement and the Transactions required under any applicable
statute, law, rule or regulation; and

  

  

(iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

  

  

The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings, submissions, applications and requests. The
Company and Parent shall each use

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

   
 

their commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other (on an outside
counsel basis if appropriate) all information required for any filing,
submission, application or request to be made pursuant to the rules and
regulations of any applicable statute, law, rule or regulation in connection
with the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the Company
agree that nothing contained in this Section 6.9(b) shall modify, limit or
otherwise affect their respective rights and responsibilities under Section
6.9(a).

  

  

Section 6.10 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Stock Options
pursuant to this Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered person for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 6.11 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,

  

  

(i) timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed after the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Closing by or on behalf of each such entity ("Post-
Signing Returns") and timely pay all Taxes in respect of such Post-Signing
Returns;

  

  

(ii) submit any Post-Signing Returns to Parent for approval prior to filing,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;

  

  

(iii) not take any position on a Post-Signing Return that is inconsistent with
past custom and practice (unless required by GAAP or applicable Law) without
the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed);

  

  

(iv) not make, change or rescind any material Tax election or settle or
compromise any material Tax liability, in each case without the consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed);

  

  

(v) promptly notify Parent of any Audits that are or become pending against or
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

and not settle or compromise any such Audit without the consent of Parent

ARTICLE VIII

  

TERMINATION

material action, in each case such that the condition set forth in Section
7.1(b), 7.1(c) or 7.1(d) would not be satisfied, and such Law, Order or other

(i) upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub, or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub shall be
untrue, which breach or failure to be true (A) would give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) and (B) is incapable of
being cured prior to the End Date; provided further that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c)(i) shall not be available

forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) and (B) is incapable of being cured prior to
the End Date; provided further that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.1(d)(i) shall not be available to Parent if it has failed

63  

  

 

 

 

   
 

perform in any material respect any of its obligations under or in connection
with this Agreement; or

Days from the receipt of such a request by Parent, by the close of business on

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
party or parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made and a reasonably detailed description of the basis
therefor, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void, and there
shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or
their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders,
Representatives, agents or advisors other than, with respect to Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company, the obligations pursuant to this Section 8.2, and Article
IX and the last sentence of Section 6.3; provided, however, that except as set
forth in Sections 8.2(b) and 8.2(c), nothing contained in this Section 8.2
shall relieve Parent, Merger Sub or the Company from liability for fraud or
knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) If

  

  

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii)
or by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii); or

  

  

(ii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
Sections 8.1(b)(i) or 8.1(b)(iii), (B) there has been publicly disclosed for
the first time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date of
termination of this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal (or the intention by any
Person to make an Acquisition Proposal) and (C) within twelve (12) months
after such termination, either (1) the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Qualifying Transaction pursuant to any Acquisition
Proposal or (2) the Company consummates any Qualifying Transaction
contemplated by any

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Acquisition Proposal, then, in each case, the Company shall pay to Parent a
termination fee of $13,250,000 in cash, payable (x) concurrently with any
termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), (y) within five (5)
Business Days of any termination by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(ii) or (z) on the date of the first to occur of the events referred to
in clause (C) above; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the fee referred to in this Section 8.2(b) on more than one
occasion. Upon payment of such fee, the Company shall have no further
liability to Parent or Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions, provided that nothing herein shall release the Company from
liability for fraud or knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement. All
payments contemplated by this Section 8.2(b) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent and shall be
reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
applicable Law in respect of Taxes.

  

  

(c) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or
8.1(b)(ii) and (ii) at the time of any such termination all of the conditions
set forth in Article VII have been satisfied or waived except for any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b), 7.1(c), 7.1(d) or 7.2(c) (in the case
of Sections 7.1(b) and 7.2(c), only to the extent that the conditions set
forth therein have not been satisfied due to a suit, action or proceeding by
any national Governmental Entity or the enactment or issuance of any Law or
Order, or the taking of other material action by any national Governmental
Entity, in each case, relating to Antitrust Laws), then Parent shall pay to
the Company a fee equal to $10,000,000, payable (x) concurrently with any such
termination by Parent or (y) within five (5) Business Days of any such
termination by the Company. Upon payment of such fee, Parent shall have no
further liability to the Company with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions, provided that nothing herein shall release Parent from liability
for fraud or knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement. All payments
contemplated by this Section 8.2(c) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company and shall
be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
applicable Law in respect of Taxes.

Section 9.4 Interpretation. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement. Information provided in any section or

sections and paragraphs in this Agreement to the extent that it is readily
apparent on the face of such disclosure, without reference to extrinsic
evidence, that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other
sections and paragraphs. The inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure

such item, nor shall it establish any standard of materiality for any purpose
whatsoever.

67  

  

 

 

 

   
 

the Merger Consideration and the holders of the Company Stock Options to
receive the consideration described in Section 3.4, as the case may be,
following the Effective Time in accordance with Article III and (ii) as
provided in Section 6.7 (which is intended for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties and the Insured Parties, all of whom shall be third-party
beneficiaries of these provisions from and after the Effective Time) are not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder.

  

  

Section 9.7 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority
to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated.

  

  

Section 9.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts to
be made and performed entirely therein without giving effect to the principles

irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of any United
States federal court located in the State of Delaware or the Delaware Court of
Chancery in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court
and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or
any of the Transactions in any court other than a United States federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware or the Delaware Court of Chancery; provided

proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by any United States federal
court located in the State of Delaware or the Delaware Court of Chancery in

service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred
to in Section 9.9 in any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof
by registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested,
to its address as specified in or pursuant to Section 9.3. However, the
foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on
the other party by any other legally available method.

  

  

Section 9.11 Specific Performance. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each nonbreaching
party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole
by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto (a) will
waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at law and (b) shall be entitled, in addition to any other

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

   
 

remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel specific

consent of the other parties, except that Parent or Merger Sub, upon prior
written notice to the Company, may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or
all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement (a) in the case
of Parent, to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and (b)
in the case of Merger Sub, to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger
Sub, as applicable, of any of its obligations hereunder; provided that any
such assignee of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall be primarily
liable with respect to the obligations hereunder and the liability of Parent
or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall be secondary. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and
assigns.

  

  

Section 9.13 Expenses. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger, this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions shall be paid

and the table of contents, schedules and exhibits are for convenience of the
parties only and shall be given no substantive or interpretative effect
whatsoever.

  

  

Section 9.15 Waivers. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

  

  

Section 9.16 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING

COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
THEREOF.
