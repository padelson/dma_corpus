allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as
originally submitted to the Independent Accountant, and the remainder of such
fees, costs and expenses shall be borne by Seller. For example, should the
items in dispute total $1,000 and the Independent Accountant awards $600 in
favor of Sellers position, sixty percent (60%) of the costs of its review
would be borne by Buyer and forty percent (40%) of the costs would be borne
by Seller.

  



  

2.4 _Decision_. The Independent Accountant shall render its decision in
writing within forty-five (45) days from the date all disagreements are
submitted by Seller and Buyer to the Independent Accountant for
resolution, and shall set forth any changes required in the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Working Capital. The decision of the
Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties
for all purposes. Any payment due one party from the other as a result of the
decision of the Independent Accountant shall be paid by the relevant party
within three (3) Business Days following receipt by the parties of the
written decision of the Independent Accountant.

  



  

2.5 _Relationship with Dispute Resolution Provisions_. For the avoidance of
doubt, the dispute resolution provisions of Articles IX and X of this
Agreement shall have no application to any disagreement between the parties
with respect to the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Working
Capital or its calculation.

  



        
   

  



  

 **ARTICLE III 
 OTHER AGREEMENTS**

  



  

3.1 _Access and Cooperation_.  Upon reasonable notice, Seller shall cause MMG
to afford to Buyer and its Representatives: (i) reasonable access (subject
to any legal or contractual restriction on the access to or dissemination of
any information based on the classified nature of such information) during
normal business hours to the assets, properties (including Real Property and
structures thereon) and Records of MMG and the Subsidiary; (ii) in the manner
reasonably required by Seller in each instance, reasonable access
to Representatives of Seller, MMG and the Subsidiary (including their
respective accountants and legal counsel) who would reasonably be presumed to
have information which would be relevant for the purposes of preparing for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
conduct of the Business thereafter; and (iii) in the manner reasonably
required by Seller in each instance, access to material vendors, customers
and others having material business dealings with MMG and the Subsidiary.
Buyer shall coordinate all such access through Seller. Seller may, as
a condition to permitting Buyer to contact vendors and customers of the
Business, require that personnel of Seller, MMG and/or the Subsidiary
participate in the contact.

  



  

3.2 _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) _Confidentiality Agreement_. Buyer and Seller agree that the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect;
provided, that (i) in the event of a conflict between the terms of this
Agreement and the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this
Agreement shall govern and (ii) the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed
to have terminated with respect to all information other than information
relating to Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than MMG and the
Subsidiary) without further action by the parties upon the occurrence of the
Closing.

  



  

(b) _Post-Closing_. From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all
information, whether written or oral, concerning MMG and the Subsidiary,
except to the extent that such information: (i) is in the public domain
through no fault of Seller or any of its Affiliates; (ii) is lawfully
acquired by Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing from sources
that to the Knowledge of Seller or its Affiliates are not prohibited from
disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation;
(iii) may need to be disclosed in connection with the fulfillment of Sellers
obligations under this Agreement; or (iv) may need to be disclosed, as
reasonably determined by Sellers counsel, in connection with any dispute
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. If Seller
or any of its Affiliates or agents is compelled to disclose any such
information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of
Law, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only
that portion of such information that Seller is advised by its counsel in
writing is legally required to be disclosed; provided, that Seller shall, if
requested by Buyer, exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain an
appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance at Buyers expense
that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.

  



        
   

  



  

3.3 _Disclosure Schedule_.

  



  

(a) _Disclosure Schedule_. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, Seller is delivering to Buyer the Disclosure Schedule,
which is accompanied by a certificate signed by an officer of Seller, stating
that the Disclosure Schedule is being delivered pursuant to this Agreement
and is the Disclosure Schedule referred to in this Agreement. The Disclosure
Schedule is deemed to constitute an integral part of this Agreement and to
establish specific factual exceptions to the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement to the extent
that such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements expressly
refer to the Disclosure Schedule. Any matter set forth in any Schedule of
the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any Section
of this Agreement to which such matter logically relates, so long as the
description of such matter contains sufficient facts to provide reasonable
notice of the relevance of such matter. No reference to or disclosure of any
item on the Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an admission or
indication that such item or other matter is material or that such item or
other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed on the Disclosure
Schedule.

  



  

(b) _Updates_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall update the Disclosure
Schedule (except with respect to Article VI) to reflect all matters which:
(i) exist on the date of this Agreement and should have been included on the
Disclosure Schedule under the terms of this Agreement but were not previously
included in the Disclosure Schedule; or (ii) have occurred from and after the
date of this Agreement, and in either case, had they been known or existed on
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be described in the
Disclosure Schedule (a "Disclosure Schedule Change").  Seller shall deliver
such Disclosure Schedule Change as soon as practicable upon discovery of such
matter, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. A Disclosure Schedule Change made pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(i)
hereof shall be deemed to have been delivered solely for informational
purposes and shall not be deemed to update the Disclosure Schedule or cure
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement for
any purpose under this Agreement or to prejudice any rights of Buyer under
this Agreement, including the right to claim that the representations and
warranties of Seller, when made on the date of this Agreement were untrue.

  



  

3.4 _Duties Concerning Conditions Precedent_.  Each party to this Agreement
shall use reasonable efforts to cause all of the conditions precedent set
forth in Articles VII and VIII of this Agreement to be satisfied.

  



  

3.5 _Deliveries of Information_.  Subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.3(b) of this
Agreement, from time to time prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall furnish
promptly to Buyer: (i) the monthly consolidated financial statements of MMG
(as prepared by MMG in accordance with its normal accounting procedures)
promptly after such financial statements are available; (ii) a summary of any
action taken by Seller as the sole member and manager of MMG; (iii) a summary
of any action taken by the Subsidiarys Board of Directors, or any committee
thereof; (iv) to the extent permitted by Law, any notice or other
communication from any Government Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (v) any communication from any third

  



        
   

  



  

party alleging that the consent of such third party may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (vi) all
other information concerning the operations, properties and personnel of MMG
and the Subsidiary as Buyer may reasonably request.

  



  

3.6 _Exclusivity Letter Extension_.  Upon execution of this Agreement, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer an amendment to the Exclusivity Letter as previously
executed and extended by the parties extending the period of exclusivity
until November 30, 2008 (which shall commence on the date hereof and shall
include an automatic extension as described in the next sentence).
The exclusivity period under such amendment shall be automatically extended
without any further action required by either party until December 30, 2008
only if, within seventy-five days after the date hereof, (a) the formal
notice requesting Exon-Florio Clearance has been filed by Buyer and Seller,
(b) Buyer has resolved how it will proceed, which may include the use of
alternative approaches, with respect to presenting to DSS solutions for
securing information deemed to be communications security material by the
United States Government that is used in connection with the Business
("COMSEC Material"), and (c) Buyer has kept Seller informed as to the status
of the Exon-Florio Clearance; provided that such extension shall continue
only if Buyer continues to keep Seller so informed after November 30, 2008.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto understand and agree that this
Section 3.6 does not provide either Seller or Buyer any right to terminate
this Agreement and that this Agreement may only be terminated in accordance
with the express provisions of Article XI of this Agreement.

  



  

3.7 _Public Announcements_.  Subject to each partys disclosure obligations
imposed by law, Parent, Seller, Fincantieri and Buyer will cooperate and
consult with each other in the development and distribution of all
Announcements and shall not issue any Announcement without the approval of
the other parties. Each party acknowledges that the other parties (or their
respective Affiliates) may be subject to legally required disclosures, which
may require such party (or one of its Affiliates) to make one or
more Announcements regarding this Agreement on very short notice. Under such
circumstances, the party that is required to make such Announcement will
exercise reasonable efforts to comply with the foregoing provisions of this
Section 3.7 and will provide reasonable prior written notice and a copy of
such Announcement to the other parties, but the party that is required to
make such Announcement has the right to proceed with any Announcement without
the other parties prior approval if the party that is required to make such
Announcement is unable to obtain the other parties approval at a time when
the party that is required to make such Announcement, on the advice of
counsel, has made a good faith determination that it is legally required to
issue such Announcement.

  



  

3.8 _Access to Records and Employees_.

  



  

(a) _Records_. For a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date (or
as reasonably extended to accommodate any Parent or Seller Tax audit), solely
for the purposes of defending Third Party Claims or complying with regulatory
or other legal obligations of Parent or Seller, Buyer agrees to permit Parent
and Seller and their Representatives, such access to, and right to copy, such
Records (including engineering data, designs, drawings, blue prints and other
similar documents that were

  



        
   

  



  

Records of the Company prior to Closing) as Parent or Seller may deem
reasonably necessary or reasonably desirable. Any such examination and
copying shall be at the expense of Parent and Seller, shall be performed
at the place where Records are regularly maintained by MMG and shall
not unreasonably interfere with the normal business activities of MMG. Buyer
shall notify Seller if at any time prior to January 1, 2015, it intends to
destroy any or all of such Records and Parent and Seller shall have the right
to review and remove such Records at their expense.

  



  

(b) _Employees_. Until January 1, 2011, solely for the purposes of defending
Third Party Claims or complying with regulatory or other legal obligations of
Parent or Seller, Buyer shall afford Parent and Seller access to those
employees of MMG or the Subsidiary who were employees of MMG or the
Subsidiary, as the case may be, prior to the Closing Date, or any employees
hired by MMG or the Subsidiary after the Closing Date to replace any such
employee. Any such access shall be: (i) at the reasonable request of Parent
or Seller; and (ii) scheduled and provided on a reasonable basis taking into
account the business requirements of MMG and the Subsidiary.

  



  

3.9 _Regulatory Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly apply for, and take all
reasonably necessary actions, including, without limitation, the making of
all required filings, to obtain or make, as applicable, all Governmental
Authorizations (and authorization from the German anti-trust authority, if
applicable, at the Buyers sole expense) required to be obtained or made by
it in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement. Each party shall cooperate with and promptly furnish information
to the other party necessary in connection with any requirements imposed upon
such other party in connection with the consummation of the sale of the MMG
Ownership Interest. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller
and Buyer shall, as promptly as practicable and before the expiration of any
relevant legal deadline:

  



  

(i) Buyer and Seller shall each: (a) file as soon as reasonably
practicable after the execution of this Agreement with the Antitrust Division
of the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the Federal Trade
Commission ("FTC") the pre-merger notifications required by the HSR Act and
notification to the German anti-trust authority, if applicable, from such
party, requesting early termination of the waiting periods thereunder; (b)
promptly respond to inquiries to such party from such Persons in connection
with such filings; and (c) cooperate fully with one another in the
preparation of such filings and responses.

  



  

(ii) Buyer and Seller shall file with CFIUS the joint voluntary notice
required in order to obtain the Exon-Florio Clearance with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and furnish the DSS with the
Special Security Agreement (in form reasonably acceptable to Buyer and
Seller). The parties shall provide CFIUS and DSS with any additional or
supplemental information requested by CFIUS and DSS or its member agencies
during the Exon-Florio and FOCI review process. The parties, in cooperation
with each other, shall take all commercially reasonable steps advisable,
necessary or desirable to finally and successfully complete

  



        
   

  



  

the Exon-Florio and FOCI review process as promptly as practicable
(including, in the case of Buyer, making reasonable efforts to (X) work with
each Government Entity to structure any remedy or condition that may be
sought to be imposed by such Government Entity as a prerequisite to granting
Exon-Florio Clearance or (Y) work with such Government Entity to devise an
alternative arrangement so that any such remedy, condition or alternative
arrangement, as the case may be, is both acceptable to such Government Entity
and consistent with Buyers Strategic Initiative); provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 3.9 shall be deemed to require Buyer or LMC to agree
to (A) take any action or refrain from taking any action, (B) become subject
to any condition, restriction or obligation, or (C) become subject to any
adverse action relating to the facility security clearances of MMG or the
Subsidiary or the personnel security clearance of any employee of Buyer or
MMG or the Subsidiary that materially affects or would reasonably be expected
to materially affect MMGs, the Subsidiarys or Buyers ability to conduct
the Business in the case of each of (A), (B) and (C) that, in the case of
Buyer, materially impedes its ability to accomplish the Buyers Strategic
Initiatives, as determined by Buyer in its reasonable discretion, and, in the
case of LMC, as LMC does not deem appropriate in its sole and absolute
discretion.

  



  

(b) Each of Buyer and Seller shall keep the other apprised of the status of
any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from CFIUS, the FTC and the DOJ and any other Government
Entities, and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request.

  



  

(c) In the event that a Government Entity requires LMC to accept
responsibility for securing COMSEC Material as a condition to obtaining Exon-
Florio Clearance and LMC has declined to accept such responsibility, Parent
and Seller shall take commercially reasonable efforts to obtain approval from
the DSS to secure COMSEC Material on behalf of Buyer, on an interim basis not
to exceed twelve (12) months; provided, that Buyer shall reimburse Parent or
Seller, as applicable, on a monthly basis, within thirty (30) days of receipt
of an invoice from Parent or Seller, for one hundred and five percent (105%)
of any and all costs incurred by Parent or Seller in connection with
obtaining approval for such arrangement and in connection with providing such
service to Buyer.

  



  

3.10 _Resignation of Officers of MMG and of Directors and Officers of the
Subsidiary_. Prior to or at the Closing, the directors, managers and officers
of MMG and the directors and officers of the Subsidiary listed on Schedule
3.10 to the Disclosure Schedule (the "Resigning Directors and Officers")
shall have tendered their written resignations from such positions effective
as of the Closing.

  



  

3.11 _Third Party Consents_.  Seller shall use reasonable efforts to cause
MMG and the Subsidiary, promptly following the date of this Agreement, to
obtain any and all consents and approvals of third parties ("Third Party
Consents") that are required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the terms of any Existing Contract or
material Existing Permit.

  



         
 

  



  

3.12 _Noncompete_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Seller agree that, for a period of three (3) years from and
including the Closing Date ("Restricted Period"), they shall not, and they
shall cause their Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of
Buyer, directly or indirectly, either alone or acting in concert with another
Person or Persons, engage in any business which designs, manufactures,
constructs, repairs, maintains or services ships in the United States or
Canada; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude Parent, Seller
and their respective Affiliates from acquiring and/or owning, in the
aggregate, less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares or
other ownership interests of a publicly traded company which might be deemed
to be engaged in activities that compete with the Business, provided their
investment in such company is for passive investment only.  In addition,
Parent and Seller covenant that, during the Restricted Period, Parent and
Seller shall not, and they shall cause their respective Affiliates not to,
solicit the employment or engagement of services of any Person who is or was
employed as an employee, contractor or consultant by MMG or the Subsidiary
during such period on a full- or part-time basis (a "Protected Person"). The
foregoing restriction shall not prohibit Parent, Seller or any of their
Affiliates from engaging in general advertising for employment, independent
contractor or consulting services and from hiring any person responding to
such advertisements; _provided_ , in each case, that such advertising was not
specifically targeted at any Protected Person.

  



  

(b) Parent and Seller acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this
Section 3.12 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests
of Buyer and constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the acquisition of the MMG Ownership Interest.
 Parent and Seller acknowledge that any violation of this Section 3.12 will
result in irreparable injury to Buyer and agree that Buyer shall be entitled
to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, without the necessity of
proving actual damages, as well as an equitable accounting of all earnings,
profits and other benefits arising from any violation of this Section
3.12, which right shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or
remedies to which Buyer may be entitled.

  



  

3.13 _No Implied Representations or Warranties_.  The parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that no party is making any representation or warranty
whatsoever, express or implied, except those representations and warranties
explicitly set forth in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) except for the express representations and warranties
made by Seller in Article IV hereof, Seller makes no representation or
warranty to Buyer with respect to: (A) the merchantability or fitness for
a particular purpose of any assets or properties of MMG or the Subsidiary;
(B) any projections, estimates or budgets heretofore delivered to or made
available to Buyer of future revenues, expenses or expenditures or future
results of operations of MMG, the Subsidiary or the Business; or (C) any
other information or documents (financial or otherwise) made available to
Buyer or its Representatives with respect to MMG, the Subsidiary and the
Business during Buyers due diligence, or otherwise, including, without
limitation, the descriptive memorandum provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner and Smith Incorporated; and (ii) except for the express representations
and warranties made by Buyer pursuant to Article V hereof, Buyer makes
no representation or warranty to Seller with respect to any information
or documents

  



        
   

  



  

(financial or otherwise) made available to Seller or Sellers counsel,
accountants or advisers with respect to Buyer or its Affiliates.

  



  

3.14 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Returns and Payments_.

  



  

(i) _Consolidated Returns for Periods Through the Closing Date_. Buyer shall
cause MMG and the Subsidiary to consent to join, for all taxable periods of
MMG and the Subsidiary ending on or before the Closing Date for which MMG and
the Subsidiary are eligible to do so, in any consolidated, combined
or unitary federal, state, local or foreign income and franchise Tax Returns
that Parent shall request MMG and the Subsidiary to join. Parent shall cause
to be prepared and filed all such consolidated, combined or unitary Tax
Returns. Buyer shall cooperate with Parent and its Affiliates in the
preparation of the portions of such Returns pertaining to MMG and the
Subsidiary. Parent shall cause to be timely paid all Taxes to which such
Returns relate for all periods covered by such Returns. Parent will include
or have included in its consolidated federal income Tax Return for
all periods or portions thereof through the Closing Date the income of MMG
and the Subsidiary (including any deferred income from intercompany
transactions and any excess loss accounts). Parent will not change any
position on such Tax Returns that relate to MMG and the Subsidiary from the
Tax positions taken on Tax Returns filed prior to the Closing Date that
relate to MMG and the Subsidiary. The income of MMG and the Subsidiary shall
be apportioned to the period up to and including the Closing Date and the
period after the Closing Date by closing the books of MMG and the Subsidiary
as of the end of the Closing Date. If MMG and the Subsidiary are permitted,
but not required under applicable state, local, or foreign income Tax Laws to
treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, then the parties
shall treat that day as the last day of a taxable period.

  



  

(ii) _Tax Periods Ending on or, Before the Closing Date_. Parent shall
cause to be prepared at least 75 days before they are due (including
extensions) and Buyer shall cause to be timely filed all required state,
local and foreign Tax Returns of MMG and the Subsidiary for any Tax period
that ends on or before the Closing Date, for which Tax Returns have not been
filed as of the Closing Date. Parent shall permit Buyer to review and
comment on each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence prior to
filing. If Buyer objects to such Tax Return, the parties shall endeavor to
reach agreement for a period of ten (10) days, and if the parties are unable
to reach an agreement within such ten (10)day period, they shall resolve any
disputes using the dispute mechanism set forth in Section 2.3, which shall be
conclusive and binding on the parties. Parent shall pay to Buyer the amount
of the Taxes with respect to such Tax Returns as prepared by Parent if Buyer
doesnt object or, if applicable, as has been determined in accordance with
the dispute mechanism as described in this Section 3.14(a)(ii) within five
(5) days following any demand by Buyer for such payment less any amount
relating to such Taxes (as finally determined in accordance with Article
II) that was taken into account in the calculation of the Closing Date
Working Capital, which demand shall not be earlier than ten (10) days before
such Taxes are due.

  



  

(iii) _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_.
Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed any
Tax

  



        
   

  



  

Returns of MMG and the Subsidiary for Tax periods that begin before the
Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period").  Buyer
shall permit Parent to review and comment on each such Tax Return described
in the preceding sentence prior to filing. If Parent objects to such Tax
Returns, the parties shall endeavor to reach agreement for a period of ten
(10) days, and if the parties are unable to reach an agreement with such ten
(10)-day period, they shall resolve any disputes using the dispute mechanism
set forth in Section 2.3, which shall be conclusive and binding on the
parties. Parent shall pay to Buyer the amount of the Taxes with respect to
such Tax Returns as prepared by Buyer if Parent doesnt object or, if
applicable, as has been determined in accordance with the dispute mechanism
as described in this Section 3.14(a)(iii) within five (5) days following any
demand by Buyer for such payment less any amount relating to such Taxes (as
finally determined in accordance with Article II) that was taken into account
in the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital, which demand shall
not be earlier than ten (10) days before such Taxes are due. For purposes of
prorating Taxes, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis and are payable for a taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of
such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (A) in the case of any
Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed
to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire taxable period, and (B) in the case of any Tax
based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing
Date, provided that any Taxes attributable to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be allocated to the portion of the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a taxable period
that begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into
account as though the relevant taxable period ended as of the end of the
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with the prior practice of
MMG and the Subsidiary.

  



  

(iv) _Tax Elections and Accounting Methods_. In preparing the income
and franchise Tax Returns referenced in this Section 3.14(a), neither
party shall make or cause to be made any material Tax election or change any
material income Tax accounting method or period without giving prior written
notice to and receiving prior written consent of the other party; provided,
however, that such prior written consent shall not be required if and to the
extent such change or election (A) is required by Law and no other reasonable
method exists to comply with such Law or (B) will not materially increase
the amount of income or franchise Taxes that would be owing for periods
covered by an income or franchise Tax Return for which the other party has
filing responsibility hereunder or for which the other party is allocated
Taxes hereunder, with such materiality determined prior to such election
or change. Except for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
transactions in the ordinary course of business, Buyer shall not cause Parent
or Seller to recognize taxable income on the Closing Date.

  



        
   

  



  

(v) _Allocations_. The portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the
noncompete agreement described in Section 3.12 hereof shall equal Eighteen
Million and no/100 Dollars ($18,000,000). Except as may be required by Law,
neither Buyer nor Parent will, nor will they permit any of their Affiliates
to, (A) file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns in a manner inconsistent
with the foregoing election allocation and (B) take any action
inconsistent therewith.

  



  

(b) _Indemnification; Audits_.

  



  

(i) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from and against any and
all liability, (A) for federal, state and local income and franchise Taxes of
any member of any Relevant Group assessed against MMG and the Subsidiary for
any taxable period by reason of MMG and the Subsidiary being severally liable
for the entire Tax of such Relevant Group pursuant to Treasury Regulation
1.1502-6 or any analogous state or local Tax provision by Contract or
otherwise, (B) for all Pre-Closing Taxes of MMG and the Subsidiary and (C)
Transfer Taxes.

  



  

(ii) Buyer shall promptly notify Parent in writing upon receipt by Buyer or
any Affiliate of Buyer (including MMG and the Subsidiary) of notice of any
pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments that may affect the Tax
liabilities of MMG and the Subsidiary and for which Parent could be liable
under Section 3.14(b)(i). Parent shall have the sole right to represent MMGs
and the Subsidiarys interests in any Tax matter, including,
without limitation, any audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or the
filing of any amended return, that involves a Tax liability or potential Tax
liability for which Parent agrees to be liable under Section 3.14(b)(i) (a
"Tax Matter"), and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense, but
subject to the contest provisions and procedures in Section 9.3(b). Buyer
shall cooperate fully with Parent and its counsel in the defense or
compromise of any Tax Matter.

  



  

(c) _Refunds_. Any refunds or credits of federal, state, local or foreign
income and franchise Taxes (including any interest thereon) received by or
credited to MMG or the Subsidiary attributable to Tax periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date (except for Tax periods described in Sections
3.14(a)(ii) or (iii) which were included in the calculation of Closing Date
Working Capital) (collectively, "Parents Refunds") shall be for the benefit
of Parent, and Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
Parents Refunds and shall cause MMG and the Subsidiary to pay over to Parent
any Parents Refunds immediately upon receipt thereof. Any refund of Taxes
(including any interest thereon), other than Parents Refunds, that relates
to MMG or the Subsidiary shall be the property of MMG or the Subsidiary, as
applicable, and shall be retained by MMG or the Subsidiary (or promptly paid
by Parent to MMG or the Subsidiary if any such refund (or interest thereon)
is received by Parent or any of its respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates).
Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any such refund or
other benefit realized by MMG or the Subsidiary that results from the
carryforward of any Tax attribute from a pre-Closing period shall be the
property of MMG or the Subsidiary and shall be retained by MMG or the
Subsidiary, as applicable.

  



  

(d) _Cooperation_.  After the Closing Date, Parent and Buyer shall make
available to the other, as reasonably requested, and to any Taxing Authority
(which such authority is legally permitted to receive pursuant to its
subpoena power or its 

  



        
   

  



  

equivalent) all information, records or documents relating to Tax liabilities
or potential Tax liabilities of MMG and the Subsidiary for all periods prior
to or including the Closing Date and shall preserve all such information,
Records and documents until the expiration of any applicable statute of
limitations for assessment or refund of Taxes or extensions thereof.  Buyer
shall, at the request of Parent, prepare, or cause MMG and the Subsidiary to
prepare, and provide to Parent such federal, state, local and foreign Tax
information packages as Parent shall request for Parents use in preparing
any Tax Return that relates to MMG and the Subsidiary. Such Tax information
packages shall be completed by Buyer and provided to Parent within forty-five
(45) calendar days after Parents request therefor, but need not be provided
any earlier than ninety (90) calendar days following the end of the
applicable taxable year. Subject to the foregoing, each party shall bear its
own expenses in complying with the foregoing provisions.

  



  

(e) _Payment of Transfer Taxes and Fees_. Seller shall pay all Transfer Taxes
arising out of or in connection with the transactions effected pursuant to
this Agreement, and shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer,
Buyers Affiliates including, following the Closing, MMG and the Subsidiary
with respect to such Transfer Taxes. Parent shall file all necessary
documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

(f) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any and all Tax allocation or
sharing agreements or other agreements or arrangements binding MMG and/or the
Subsidiary shall be terminated with respect to MMG and the Subsidiary as of
the day before the Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date, neither
MMG nor the Subsidiary shall be obligated to make any payment to Parent or
any of its Affiliates, Taxing Authority or other Person pursuant to any such
agreement or arrangement for any past or future period.

  



  

(g) _Purchase Price Adjustments_. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, the parties shall treat any indemnification payment made
under this Agreement as an adjustment to Purchase Price.

  



  

3.15 _Workers  Compensation Insurance_.  As of the Closing Date, all
insurance requirements of MMG and the Subsidiary, including without
limitation requirements for workers compensation coverage, will be the sole
responsibility of Buyer, MMG or the Subsidiary. From and after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall be responsible for (a) those workers compensation claims
that are related to injuries incurred by Affected Employees on or after the
Closing Date and (b) those workers compensation claims related to injuries
incurred by Affected Employees prior to the Closing Date for which claims are

responsible for all workers compensation claims that are related to injuries
incurred prior to the Closing Date to the extent the claim is made on or
before thirty (30) days after Closing. For purposes of this Section,
a workers compensation claim is deemed incurred when the injury or event
giving rise to the claim occurs. After the Closing, neither Buyer nor its
Affiliates (including MMG and the Subsidiary) shall have any right to make
claims under workers compensation insurance policies issued by third parties
that may have provided coverage to MMG and the Subsidiary as Affiliates of
Parent prior to the Closing Date. None of Buyer, MMG nor the Subsidiary
shall have the right to claim directly against Parent for any "self-
insured" program of risk management or

  



        
   

  



  

the amount of any deductible or self-insured retention for any loss suffered
by MMG and the Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date, regardless of the date
on which the claim is made.

3.17 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

  



  

(a) Seller or Parent shall take all actions necessary to cause MMG and the
Subsidiary to discontinue as of the Closing their status as participating
employers under all Seller Benefit Plans (as defined in Section 4.15 hereof).
 As of the Closing Date, except to the extent set forth in this Section
3.17, the Affected Employees shall cease to be active participants under the
Seller Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, "Affected Employee"
means each individual who is employed by MMG or the Subsidiary on the Closing
Date, whether actively employed on such date or on an approved absence.

  



  

(b) Schedule 3.17(b) lists the name, location, position and base salary of
each current employee of Parent or its Affiliates (other than MMG or the
Subsidiary) who is primarily engaged in the Business (each, a "Seller
Employee"), and Seller shall provide Buyer with reasonable access to such
Seller Employees, and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, such
information regarding such employees as is contained in personnel records.
Buyer may, in its discretion, offer employment as of the Closing Date to any
Seller Employee on terms and conditions determined by Buyer.  Neither Parent
nor Seller shall have any obligation to assist Buyer in its efforts to
recruit any Seller Employee, and Seller and Parent are expressly permitted to
offer additional incentives or make additional offers of employment to Seller
Employees designed to retain the employment of Seller Employees. Any Seller
Employee who accepts Buyers offer of employment and actually commences
employment with Buyer shall become an Affected Employee upon his or her
commencement of employment.

  



  

(c) As of the Closing Date, all Seller Benefit Plans shall be terminated with
respect to Affected Employees; provided that except as specifically provided
in this Section 3.17, Seller and Parent shall remain solely responsible for,
and shall indemnify Buyer and its affiliates in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Article IX against, any and all liabilities arising
under, in connection with or in respect of: (A) the Seller Benefit Plans; (B)
all defined benefit pension plans (and all rights and entitlements under such
plans); (C) Seller Employees in respect of their employment with Parent,
Seller or their Affiliates; and (D) claims relating to coverage under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"),
attributable to "qualifying events" occurring prior to the Closing Date with
respect to any Affected Employee.

  



  

(d) Except as specifically provided in this Section 3.17, neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, MMG and the
Subsidiary) shall adopt, become a sponsoring employer of, nor have any
responsibility or obligation under or in respect of any such Seller Benefit
Plans.  Except as specifically provided in

  



        
   

  



  

this Section 3.17, no assets held in trust solely for any Seller Benefit Plan
will be transferred to Buyer or to any Employee Benefit Plan adopted or
maintained by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, that any assets
attributable to any MMG Benefit Plan held in any group trust that also
includes assets of plans other than an MMG Benefit Plan shall, upon or as
soon as practicable after the Closing, be transferred to a trust established
by Buyer or its Affiliates for such MMG Benefit Plan.

  



  

(e) Without limiting the scope of Section 3.17(c), Seller shall be
responsible for (i) all medical, life insurance, disability and other welfare
plan expenses and benefits with respect to claims incurred by an Affected
Employee or his covered dependents prior to the Closing Date, (ii) claims
relating to coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1985, as amended ("COBRA") attributable to "qualifying events" occurring
prior to the Closing Date with respect to any Affected Employee or former
employee of MMG or the Subsidiary, and (iii) claims relating to the provision
of post-employment welfare benefits to any Affected Employee or former
employees of MMG or the Subsidiary, regardless of when incurred. For purposes
of this paragraph, a medical claim is deemed incurred when the services that
are the subject of the claim are performed, provided that services performed
after the Closing Date that are related to a hospital confinement that
commenced prior to the Closing Date shall be deemed incurred prior to the
Closing Date; in the case of life insurance, when the death occurs; and in
the case of disability, when the injury or event giving rise to the
disability occurs.

  



  

(f) As of the Closing Date or as soon as administratively practicable
thereafter, Seller or Parent shall contribute to each applicable Seller
401(k) Plan (as defined below) for the benefit of the Affected Employees (A)
all contributions due with respect to the last plan year ending prior to the
Closing Date, and (B) all employee contributions with respect to the plan
year including the Closing Date and relating to compensation earned by the
Affected Employees as of the Closing Date. As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall establish or maintain a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan or plans which includes a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the
"Buyers 401(k) Plan") for the benefit of Affected Employees who are covered
by The Manitowoc Company, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan and The Manitowoc
Company, Inc. 401(k) Retirement Plan (together, the "Sellers 401(k) Plans")
as of the Closing Date. Immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause
all of the account balances of the Affected Employees under the Sellers
401(k) Plans to become fully vested. As soon as practicable after the
Buyer establishes or maintains the Buyers 401(k) Plan, and if requested by
an Affected Employee, the Seller or one of its Affiliates shall take all
actions necessary to initiate a transfer of eligible rollover distributions
as defined in section 401(a)(31) of the Code, from the Sellers 401(k) Plans,
to the Buyers 401(k) Plan, and the Buyer shall cause the Buyers 401(k)
Plan to accept such rollover.

  



  

(g) The provisions of this Section 3.17 are solely for the benefit of the
respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Agreement expressed
or implied shall confer upon any current or former Affected Employee or upon
any representative of any such Person, or upon any collective bargaining
agent, or upon any other person, any rights or remedies, including any third
party beneficiary rights or any

  



        
   

  



  

right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, of any
nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

3.18 _Intercompany Liabilities and Agreements; Indebtedness; Release of
Liens_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Subsidiary to,
settle all intercompany accounts (including any positive or negative Cash and
Cash Equivalents balance) between MMG and the Subsidiary, on the one hand,
and Parent, Seller and their respective Affiliates (other than MMG and the
Subsidiary), on the other hand.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall extinguish (i) all Indebtedness of MMG

Subsidiary have their own agreement with Airgas and are no longer parties to
such an agreement that includes other Affiliates of Parent.

  



  

3.19 _Payments Received by Seller After Closing_.  After the Closing, in the
event that Seller or Parent receives any payments for products or services
provided by MMG or the Subsidiary or other misdirected payments owed to MMG
or the Subsidiary, Seller or the Parent, as applicable, shall immediately pay
to Buyer all such payments received by Seller or the Parent.

Buyer and Seller shall act in good faith and use their respective
commercially reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including, without
limitation, the execution of such documents and other instruments and the

3.21 _Transition Services Agreement_.  During the period between the date
hereof and the Closing Date, Buyer, Seller and Parent agree to negotiate in
good faith the services to be provided to Buyer pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement and the applicable fees to be paid for such services,
which fees will be determined based on the parameters set forth in the

as reasonably practical after the Closing, Seller shall take commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer or MMG (as directed by Buyer) all

related to the operation of the Business and maintain a copy of any such
materials and _provided further that_ , to the extent such books, documents
or records are not able to be segregated from other books, records and
documents of Parent or its Affiliates, Parent shall, and it shall cause its
Affiliates to, grant Buyer, MMG or the Subsidiary (and their respective
Representatives) access to, and the right to copy, such books, documents and
records as Buyer, MMG or the Subsidiary may deem reasonably necessary or
reasonably desirable. Any such examination and copying shall be at the
expense of Buyer, MMG or the Subsidiary, shall be performed at the place

4.8 _Financial Information_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the last sentence of this Section 4.8(a), the financial
statements (and notes where applicable) which are part of the Financial
Information, are accurate and complete in all material respects and fairly
present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial condition, the
consolidated results of operations and the consolidated statements of
cash flows of MMG as of the respective dates thereof and for the periods
referred to therein, all in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis throughout all periods, subject to: (i) normal year-end and audit
adjustments and any other adjustments described therein (the effect of which
will not, individually or in the aggregate, be materially adverse); and (ii)
the absence of footnotes thereto. The balance of the Financial Information
was prepared in a manner consistent with MMGs past practices and is accurate
and complete in all material respects.

  



         
 

  



  

(b) MMG and the Subsidiary have no liabilities, obligations or commitments of
any nature whatsoever, asserted or unasserted, known or unknown, absolute or
contingent, accrued or unaccrued, matured or unmatured or otherwise that are
required to be reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP
(including appropriate footnotes), except (a) those that are adequately
reflected or reserved against in the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
MMG for the period ended March 31, 2008 that is included in the Financial
Information, (b) those that are identified on the Disclosure Schedule, (c)
those that have been incurred in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practice since December 31, 2007 and that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (d)
those that are not in the aggregate material in amount or nature.

  



  

4.9 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Returns_. All Tax Returns required to have been filed by or with
respect to MMG, the Subsidiary and any Relevant Group have been duly and
timely filed, or extensions thereof have been duly and timely filed (or,
if due between the date hereof and the Closing Date, will be duly and timely
filed or extensions thereof have been duly and timely filed), and each such
Tax Return correctly and completely reflects liability for Taxes and all
other information required to be reported thereon, or to the extent it is
ultimately determined to the contrary, specific reserves have been put into
place. All Taxes owed by MMG, the Subsidiary and any member of a Relevant
Group (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been timely paid, subject
to any duly and timely filed extensions (or, if due between the date hereof
and the Closing Date, will be duly and timely paid, subject to any duly and
timely filed extensions).  MMG and the Subsidiary have made available for
review by Buyer all Tax Returns which have been filed since December 31, 2003
on their behalf together with related Tax Records.

  



  

(b) _Payment of Taxes_. The aggregate liability of MMG and the Subsidiary for
Taxes (whether or not assessed) as of the date of the latest consolidated
balance sheet included in the Financial Information did not exceed the
accrual for Tax liability (other than any accrual for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and tax income)
disclosed on the face of such consolidated balance sheet. Since December 31,
2007, neither MMG nor the Subsidiary have incurred any liability for Taxes
outside the ordinary course of business.

  



  

(c) _Audits; Tax Claims_. Except as identified on Schedule 4.9(c) to the
Disclosure Schedule, there is no audit, claim or assessment pending or,
to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against MMG or the Subsidiary with
respect to any Taxes declared owing by MMG or the Subsidiary. No taxing
authority has challenged any Tax position taken prior to the Closing Date on
a Tax Return of MMG or the Subsidiary that could reasonably be expected to
result in additional Tax liability for MMG or the Subsidiary relating to
closed Tax periods not examined by such taxing authority. Schedule 4.9(c)
to the Disclosure Schedule lists all federal, state, local, and foreign
income Tax Returns filed with respect to MMG and the Subsidiary for taxable
periods ended on or after December 31, 2003 (i) that have been audited, (ii)
that currently are the subject of audit or (iii) that are open. Seller has
made available to Buyer on the Merrill Datasite correct and complete copies
of all examination reports, and statements of deficiencies assessed against
or agreed to by MMG and the

  



        
   

  



  

Subsidiary since December 31, 2003. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.9(c),
neither MMG nor the Subsidiary has waived (or is subject to a waiver of) any
statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or has agreed to (or is subject
to) any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.
Except as set forth on Schedule 4.9(c), neither MMG nor the Subsidiary is the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return, nor
have MMG or the Subsidiary made (or had made on their behalf) any requests
for such extensions. There are no Liens on any of the stock or assets of MMG
or the Subsidiary with respect to Taxes.

  



  

(d) _Tax Allocation Agreements_. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.9(d)
to the Disclosure Schedule, neither MMG nor the Subsidiary is a party to any
Tax allocation or sharing agreement. Neither MMG nor the Subsidiary has any
liability for the Taxes of any Person, other than under Section 1.1502-6 of
the Treasury Regulations (or any similar provision of state, local, or
foreign Law) with respect to any Relevant Group of which MMG or the
Subsidiary currently is a member, (i) as a transferee or successor, (ii) by
contract, (iii) under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), or (iv) otherwise.
Neither MMG nor the Subsidiary is a party to any joint venture or partnership
that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.

  



  

(e) _Withholding_. MMG and the Subsidiary have properly withheld and timely
paid all withholding and employment Taxes which they were required to
withhold and pay relating to salaries, compensation and other
amounts heretofore paid to its employees or other Persons. All Forms W-2 and
1099 required to be filed with respect thereto have been timely and properly
filed. MMG and the Subsidiary have complied with all other information
reporting and backup withholding requirements, including maintenance of
required records with respect thereto.

  



  

(f) None of the assets or properties of MMG and the Subsidiary constitutes
tax-exempt bond financed property or tax-exempt use property within the
meaning of Section 168 of the Code. Neither MMG nor the Subsidiary is a
party to any "safe harbor lease" within the meaning of Section 168(f)(8)
of the Code, as in effect prior to amendment by the Tax Equity and
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, or to any "long-term contract" within the
meaning of Section 460 of the Code. Neither MMG nor the Subsidiary has ever
been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. Neither Seller nor Parent is a
"foreign person" within the meaning of Section 1445 of the Code. Neither MMG
nor the Subsidiary has made any payments, is obligated to make any payments,
or is a party to any agreement that under certain circumstances could
obligate it to make payments that would result in a nondeductible expense
under Section 280G of the Code or an excise Tax to the recipient of such
payments pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code. Neither MMG nor the
Subsidiary has participated in or cooperated with an international boycott as

case may be, has not taken adequate steps to prevent such a default from
occurring) on the part of MMG or the Subsidiary or the other parties thereto,

any of the Subsidiarys Government Contracts for convenience or indicating an
intent to terminate any of such Government Contracts for convenience.

MMG nor the Subsidiary has received written notice that there are outstanding
claims or disputes against MMG or the Subsidiary relating to a Government
Contract and involving any Government Entity, any prime contractor, or any
third party, which claim or dispute is material to the applicable Government
Contract. To the Knowledge of the Seller, except as described in Schedule
4.23(e) to the Disclosure Schedule, there exist no facts or allegations that
could give rise to such a claim or dispute in the future. Neither MMG nor
the Subsidiary has been found to be not presently responsible in the last
three years with respect to any current or past Government Bid. Except as

Entity in connection with the Contract relating to the LCS that were also

performance evaluations or ratings in connection with the Subsidiarys
Government Contracts that could reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the

  



        
   

  



  

evaluation of MMGs or the Subsidiarys (or either of their successors)
current Government Bids or bids or proposals for future Government Contracts.

of the Government Contracts.

  



  

(h) To the Knowledge of Seller, all Government Contracts have been awarded to
MMG or the Subsidiary, and all Government Bids have been submitted by MMG or
the Subsidiary, under a full and open procurement process without
preferential treatment of any kind. There are no Government Contracts
or Government Bids to which MMG or the Subsidiary is a party or bound
premised on MMG or the Subsidiary having 8(a) status, small business status,
small disadvantaged business status, protege status or other preferential
status.

  



  

(i) _Deficiencies Noted in Audit Reports._ All material deficiencies noted
in audits that have been performed by any Government Entity in

official, member, employee or customer of a Government Entity, any political
party or official thereof, or any candidate for political office or (b) any
other Person, in any such case while knowing or having reason to know that
all or a portion of such money or thing of value may be offered, given or
promised, directly or indirectly, to any customer, member of the government

improperly influencing any action or decision of such Person, in his or its
official capacity, including a decision to fail to perform his or its

other consideration is or was contingent upon the award of any government
contract to either MMG, the Subsidiary or any Affiliate of either of them or
that would otherwise be in violation of any Law, or (B) where such payment or
other consideration would constitute a bribe, kickback or illegal or improper
payment to assist either MMG, the Subsidiary or any Affiliate of either of
them in obtaining or retaining business for, or with, or directing business
to, any Person. To date, each of MMG and the Subsidiary has made all

9.3 _Provisions Regarding Indemnities_.

  



  

(a) _Recoveries_. The Indemnifiable Losses for which an indemnifying party
shall be liable under Sections 9.1 and 9.2 of this Agreement shall be net of
any insurance proceeds (other than any insurance proceeds received under any
environmental insurance policies purchased by Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
which shall not affect in any manner any Buyer Indemnified Parties right to
recovery under Section 9.1(c) hereof; provided, that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the parties acknowledge that this parenthetical shall not entitle
Buyer to seek indemnity against Seller for an Indemnifiable Loss to the
extent that it has already been recovered by Buyer under its environmental
insurance policies) and/or payments from third parties actually received by
the indemnified party with respect to such Indemnifiable Losses, net of any
actual costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection with securing or
obtaining such proceeds and any increase in the future cost of insurance
attributable to the payment of any such insurance proceeds; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that no payment of Indemnifiable Losses will be withheld
or delayed as a result of any insurance claims that are pending or may be,
but have not yet been, filed.

  



  

(b) _Notice; Third Party Claims_. Following discovery of any facts
or conditions that would reasonably be expected give rise to an
Indemnifiable Loss, the indemnified party shall promptly notify the
indemnifying party (such notice, an "Indemnity Claim Notice") in reasonable
detail of any claim, demand, action, suit, investigation or proceeding
instituted by a Person other than an indemnified party (a "Third Party
Claim") for which indemnification will be sought under Section 9.1 or Section
9.2 of this Agreement, including, to the extent known, the specific facts and
circumstances relating to such Indemnifiable Loss, the amount of the
Indemnifiable Loss (to the extent the amount is known or capable of
reasonable calculation or estimation at that time) and the specific
Section(s) of this Agreement on which the party seeking indemnification is
relying as a basis for its entitlement to such indemnification. At any time
after an indemnified party has delivered an Indemnity Notice, such
indemnified party in its discretion may supplement or amend such notice by
delivery of any correspondence, updated or amended notice or other
information relating to the claim covered by the original Indemnity Claim
Notice. Failure or delay in notifying the indemnifying party will not relieve
the indemnifying party of any liability it may have to the indemnified party,
except and only to the extent that such failure or delay causes actual harm
to the indemnifying party with respect to such Third Party Claim or non-Third
Party Claim, as applicable. If such demand, action, suit,
claim, investigation or proceeding is a Third Party Claim, then the
indemnifying party will have the right, at its expense, to participate in
and/or assume the defense thereof using counsel reasonably acceptable to the
indemnified party (provided that, with respect to a Third Party Claim
involving (i) any Contract with the U.S. Navy or the U.S. Coast Guard (where
the U.S.

  



        
   

  



  

Navy or U.S. Coast Guard is a party to such Third Party Claim), (ii) any
matter described in Section 9.1(c) and (d) or (iii) a reputational or
similarly substantial matter with respect to the indemnified party that if
adversely determined would result in, or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, the indemnifying party will only have
the right to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim if the indemnified
party does not assume the defense thereof). If the indemnifying party chooses
to assume the defense, it shall notify the indemnified party within thirty
(30) days of receipt of the Indemnity Claim Notice (or such lesser number of
days set forth in the Indemnity Claim Notice as may be required by any
Government Entity, any court proceeding or regulatory inquiry or
investigation). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense, the
indemnified party shall have the right to participate, at its own expense,
with respect to any such third party demand, action, suit,
claim, investigation or proceeding, it being understood, however, that
the indemnifying party shall control the defense.  Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, the fees and expenses of the indemnified
partys counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party if (A) the
indemnifying party shall have failed, within the time after having been
notified by the indemnified party of the existence of the Third Party Claim
as provided in this Section 9.3(b), to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim, (B) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party are both named
parties to the proceedings and the parties jointly shall have concluded in
good faith that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or
the availability to the indemnified party of one or more defenses or
counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be
available to the indemnifying party in respect thereof. In connection with any
such Third Party Claim, the parties shall cooperate with each other and
provide each other with access to relevant books and records in their
possession, including making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any materials
provided. No such Third Party Claim shall be settled without the prior
written consent of the indemnified party, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , that, with respect to any proposed
settlement involving specific performance or other non-monetary settlement,
including any restriction on the future conduct of the Business, the
indemnified party may in its sole discretion withhold consent to any
such settlement.

  



  

If (I) a firm written offer is made to settle any such Third Party
Claim, demand, action or proceeding, (II) such settlement offer contains
an unconditional release of the indemnified party with respect to the
indemnified portion of such Third Party Claim, demand, action or proceeding
and does not provide for any relief other than the payment of monetary
damages as to which the indemnified party will be fully indemnified pursuant
to this Article IX, and (III) the indemnifying party proposes to accept such
settlement and the indemnified party refuses to consent to such settlement,
then: (i) the indemnifying party shall be excused from, and the indemnified
party shall be solely responsible for, all further defense of such Third
Party Claim, demand, action or proceeding; (ii) the maximum liability of the
indemnifying party relating to such Third Party Claim, demand, action or
proceeding shall be the amount of the proposed settlement if the amount
thereafter recovered from the indemnified party on such Third Party Claim,
demand, action or proceeding is greater than the amount of the
proposed settlement; and (iii) the indemnified party shall pay all attorneys
fees and legal costs

  



        
   

  



  

and expenses incurred after rejection of such settlement by the indemnified
party, but if the amount thereafter recovered by such third party from the
indemnified party is less than the amount of the proposed settlement, the
indemnified party shall be reimbursed by the indemnifying party for such
attorneys fees and legal costs and expenses up to a maximum amount equal to
the difference between the amount recovered by such third party and the
amount of the proposed settlement.

  



  

(c) _Exclusivity_.  After the Closing Date, the rights of indemnity provided
by this Article IX of this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any and all claims arising out of or relating to Buyers or
Fincantieris investigation of MMG, the Subsidiary and the Business, all
claims by any party to this Agreement arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, and the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or any
contract or agreement entered into pursuant hereto (except to the extent
otherwise expressly set forth therein) or the performance by the parties of
its or their terms, and no other remedy shall be had pursuant to any
contract, misrepresentation or other corporate or limited liability company
indemnification (whether by Law or constituent document) tort theory
or otherwise by Parent or Seller or Buyer or Fincantieri and their
respective managers, officers, directors, employees, agents, Affiliates,
attorneys, consultants, successors and assigns, all such remedies being
hereby expressly waived to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this exclusivity shall not limit in any way
(i) a partys right to bring an action against another party for such other
partys failure to carry out, perform satisfy and discharge any of such other
partys covenants, agreements, undertakings, liabilities or obligations under
this Agreement, (ii) any claim for actual fraud (and for the avoidance of
doubt, actual fraud shall not include any claim for any non-fraudulent breach
or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty), or (iii) any dispute
related to the Closing Date Working Capital adjustment under Section 2.3 of
this Agreement, which shall be governed by the terms of Section 2.3 hereof.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Buyer s Rights_.  The right of Buyer to receive
indemnity provided under Section 9.1 of this Agreement shall, as to any
matter which has not been described in a notice delivered to Seller pursuant
to Section 9.3(b) of this Agreement prior to such time, expire at 11:59 P.M.

which has not been described in a notice delivered to Buyer pursuant to
Section 9.3(b) of this Agreement prior to such time, expire at 11:59 P.M.
Central Time on the eighteen (18)-month anniversary of the Closing Date,
except that Sellers right to indemnity pursuant to:

survive until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date;

  



  

(ii) Section 9.2(b) with respect to covenants, agreements and undertakings
that are to be performed in whole or in part after the Closing shall survive

as applicable; and

  



  

(iv) Section 9.2(d) shall survive, with respect to any Assumed Parent
Guarantee, until the expiration or termination of the contract, letter of
credit or other agreement underlying such Assumed Parent Guarantee.

  



  

(f) _Rights on Termination_.  The termination pursuant to Sections 9.3(d) and
9.3(e) of this Agreement of the rights of an indemnified party to receive
indemnity shall not affect that Persons right to prosecute to conclusion any

relevant right of indemnity terminates.

  



  

(g) _Limitations on Seller s Liability_.  The liability of the Parent and

Agreement, shall:

  



  

(A) not arise on account of a breach of a representation or warranty made by
Seller if, prior to the Closing, Buyer obtains actual

($1,500,000.00); and

  



  

(B) be limited in the aggregate to an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%)
of the Purchase Price; (provided that the $1,500,000 basket referred to in
Section 9.3(g)(ii)(A) shall not be accounted for in calculating such amount).

  



  

(iii) The liability of the Parent and Seller in the aggregate under Section
9.1 of this Agreement shall:

  



  

(A) be limited to Indemnifiable Losses (as that term is defined in Section
9.3(i) of this Agreement);

  



  

(B) be limited to only one recovery by any indemnified party on account of
any single loss, damage, cost, expense, liability, obligation or claim, even
though such may have resulted from the breach or inaccuracy of more than one
of the representations and warranties made by Seller in or pursuant to this
Agreement; and

  



  

(C) except with respect to indemnification obligations under Section 9.1(d)
and (f) hereof, in no event exceed an out-of-pocket aggregate amount equal to
fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price.

  



         
 

  



  

(iv) With respect to any claim for indemnification under Section 9.1(c),
Seller and Parent shall have no obligation to indemnify or defend the Buyer
Indemnified Parties to the extent the Indemnifiable Losses arise from
physically invasive investigation, sampling or testing of soil or groundwater
(such as a Phase II environmental site assessment) conducted by or behalf of
Buyer, Fincantieri or LMC at any of the Leased Real Property or Owned Real
Property that is not (A) required under Environmental Laws or requested by
any Governmental Entity; (B) reasonably necessary to protect human (including
worker) health; or (C) associated with an independent business purpose (other
than the testing itself), including without limitation, in connection with
(1) a financing, (2) maintenance, construction, renovation or expansion
activities, (3) a proposed sale or transfer of MMG, any Subsidiary or all or
part of the Business, (4) the termination or expiration of the Lease (or any
amended or superseding lease) for the Leased Real Property, or (6) a proposed
sale, closure or decommissioning of any Owned Real Property or Leased Real
Property.

  



  

(h) _Limitations on Buyer s Liability_. The liability of Fincantieri and
Buyer under Section 9.2 of this Agreement shall be limited to Indemnifiable
Losses (as defined in Section 9.3(i) of this Agreement) and shall be limited
to only one recovery by any indemnified party on account of any single loss,
damage, cost, expense, liability, obligation or claim even though such may
have resulted from the breach or inaccuracy of more than one of the
representations and warranties made by Buyer in or pursuant to this Agreement
or one or more of Buyers covenants or agreements hereunder. The liability of
Fincantieri and Buyer under Section 9.2(a) of this Agreement shall: (i)
not arise with respect to a single course of conduct, related set of
circumstances, occurrence or event unless the damages suffered by an
indemnified party arising therefrom exceed Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
($25,000) ("Buyer Indemnifiable Breach"); (ii) be recoverable if and only to
the extent that the cumulative damages suffered by all indemnified parties
for all Buyer Indemnifiable Breaches exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000);
and (iii) be limited in the aggregate to an amount equal to ten percent (10%)
of the Purchase Price.

  



  

(i) _Indemnifiable Loss_. For purposes of this Agreement, an "Indemnifiable
Loss" shall mean and include any and all losses, damages, costs, expenses
(including without limitation, expenses incurred in connection with
investigating, defending or enforcing any action, suit, claim, investigation
or proceeding incident to any matter indemnified hereunder), liabilities,
obligation, claims, settlement payments, fines, penalties, corrective or
remedial costs, awards, judgments, interest, diminution in value, and other
charges or damages of any kind (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys fees and other reasonable legal costs and expenses, including
without limitation those incurred in connection with any suit, action, claim,
investigation or other proceeding) which an indemnified party may at any time
suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of a matter subject to
indemnity by the indemnifying party pursuant to Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to indemnity
matters under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 which do not relate to third party
claims, the term "Indemnifiable Loss" shall mean only actual and direct
damages, and shall not mean or include any indirect, incidental,
consequential, punitive or speculative damages such as, by way of example and
not limitation, lost profits or lost future opportunities, and shall not
include

  



        
   

  



  

pre-judgment interest in any litigated or arbitrated matter other than
interest payable to a third party. Indemnifiable Losses shall be calculated
without deduction related to any "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect"
standard or qualification contained in a relevant representation or warranty.

  



  

 **ARTICLE X 
 DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS**

  

 ** **

  

10.1 _Dispute_. As used in this Agreement, "Dispute" shall: (a) mean any
dispute or disagreement between Seller and Buyer concerning
the interpretation of this Agreement, the validity of this Agreement, any
breach or alleged breach by any party under this Agreement or any other
matter relating in any way to this Agreement; and (b) exclude any dispute or
disagreement between Seller and Buyer concerning the Closing Date Working
Capital calculation that is set forth in a partys notice to the Independent
Accountant pursuant to Section 2.3 of this Agreement.

  



  

10.2 _Process_. If a Dispute arises, the parties shall follow the procedures
specified in Sections 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5 of this Agreement.

  



  

10.3 _Negotiations_. The parties shall promptly attempt to resolve any
Dispute by negotiations between Seller and Buyer. Either Seller or Buyer may
give the other party written notice of any Dispute not resolved in the normal
course of business. Seller and Buyer shall meet at a mutually acceptable time
and place within ten (10) calendar days after delivery of such notice, and
thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to exchange relevant
information and to attempt to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute has not been
resolved by these Persons within thirty (30) calendar days of the disputing
partys notice, or if the parties fail to meet within such fifteen (15)
calendar days, either Seller or Buyer may initiate mediation as provided in
Section 10.4 of this Agreement. If a negotiator intends to be accompanied at
a meeting by legal counsel, the other negotiator shall be given at least
three (3) Business Days notice of such intention and may also be accompanied
by legal counsel.

  



  

10.4 _Mediation_. If the Dispute is not resolved by negotiations pursuant to
Section 10.3 of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good faith
to resolve any such Dispute by mediation. Either Seller or Buyer may initiate
a mediation proceeding by a request in writing to the other party (the
"Request"), and both parties will then be obligated to engage in a mediation.
The proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the then current Center
for Public Resources ("CPR") Model Procedure for Mediation of Business
Disputes, with the following exceptions:

  



  

(a) If the parties have not agreed within thirty (30) calendar days of the
Request on the selection of a mediator willing to serve, CPR, upon the
request of either Seller or Buyer, shall appoint a member of the CPR Panels
of Neutrals as the mediator; and

  



        
   

  



  

(b) Efforts to reach a settlement will continue until the conclusion of the
proceedings, which shall be deemed to occur upon the earliest of the date
that: (i) a written settlement is reached; or (ii) the mediator concludes and
informs the parties in writing that further efforts would not be useful; or
(iii) Seller and Buyer agree in writing that an impasse has been reached; or
(iv) is sixty (60) calendar days after the Request and none of the events
specified in Sections 10.4(b)(i), (ii) or (iii) have occurred. No party may
withdraw before the conclusion of the proceeding.

  



  

10.5 _Submission to Adjudication_. If a Dispute is not resolved by
negotiation pursuant to Section 10.3 of this Agreement or by mediation
pursuant to Section 10.4 of this Agreement within one hundred (100) calendar
days after initiation of the negotiation process pursuant to Section 10.3 of
this Agreement, such Dispute and any other claims arising out of or
relating to this Agreement may be heard, adjudicated and determined in an
action or proceeding filed in any federal court sitting in the Southern
District of New York.

  



  

10.6 _General_.

  



  

(a) _Provisional Remedies_. At any time during the procedures specified in
Sections 10.3 and 10.4 of this Agreement, a party may seek a
preliminary injunction or other provisional judicial relief if in its
judgment such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve
the status quo. Despite such action, the parties will continue to participate
in good faith in the procedures specified in this Article X of this
Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Tolling Statutes of Limitations_. All applicable statutes of limitation
and defenses based upon the passage of time shall be tolled while the
procedures specified in this Article X of this Agreement are pending. The
parties will take such action, if any, as is required to effectuate such
tolling.

  



  

(c) _Performance to Continue_. Each party is required to continue to
perform its obligations under this Agreement pending final resolution of any
Dispute.

  



  

(d) _Extension of Deadlines_. All deadlines specified in this Article X of
this Agreement may be extended by mutual agreement between Seller and Buyer.

  



  

(e) _Enforcement_. The parties regard the obligations in this Article X of
this Agreement to constitute an essential provision of this Agreement and one
that is legally binding on them. In case of a violation of the obligations in
this Article X of this Agreement by either Seller or Buyer, the other party
may bring an action to seek enforcement of such obligations in any court of
Law having jurisdiction thereof.

  



  

(f) _Costs_. The parties shall pay: (i) their own costs, fees, and expenses
incurred in connection with the application of the provisions of this Article
X of this Agreement; and (ii) fifty percent (50%) of the fees and expenses of
CPR and the mediator in connection with the application of the provisions of
Section 10.4 of this Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

(g) _Replacement_. If CPR is no longer in business or is unable or refuses or
declines to act or to continue to act under this Article X of this Agreement
for any reason, then the functions specified in this Article X of this
Agreement to be performed by CPR shall be performed by another Person engaged
in a business equivalent to that conducted by CPR as is agreed to by Seller
and Buyer (the "Replacement"). If Seller and Buyer cannot agree on the
identity of the Replacement within ten (10) calendar days after a Request,
the Replacement shall be selected by the Chief Judge of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York upon application. If a
Replacement is selected by either means, this Article X shall be deemed
appropriately amended to refer to such Replacement.

  



  

 **ARTICLE XI 
 TERMINATION; MISCELLANEOUS**

  

 ** **

  

11.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing, only as follows:

  



  

(a) By mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

  



  

(b) By Seller if any of the conditions set forth in Article VIII of this
Agreement (except for the conditions identified in Section 8.8 or other
conditions set forth in Article VIII that by their nature will be satisfied
at the Closing) shall not have been fulfilled within one hundred and twenty
(120) calendar days from the date of this Agreement;

  



  

(c) By Buyer if any of the conditions set forth in Article VII of this
Agreement (except for the conditions identified in Section 7.8 or other
conditions set forth in Article VII that by their nature will be satisfied at
the Closing) shall not have been fulfilled within one hundred and twenty
(120) calendar days from the date of this Agreement;

  



  

(d) By either Buyer or Seller if the Closing has not occurred on or before
December 30, 2008; provided, that if prior to such date all conditions to
Closing set forth in Articles VII and VIII have been satisfied (except for
conditions that by their nature will be satisfied at the Closing), either
party may compel specific performance by the other party to consummate the
Closing on or before December 30, 2008; or

  



  

(e) By either Buyer or Seller on December 30, 2008 if the only remaining
condition to obtaining Exon-Florio Clearance is that a Government Entity
requires LMC to accept responsibility for securing COMSEC Material and (i)
LMC has not agreed to accept such responsibility, (ii) Parent or Seller has
not obtained approval from the DSS to secure COMSEC Material on behalf of
Buyer in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.9(c) hereof, and (iii)
no other third party has obtained approval from the DSS to secure COMSEC
Material on behalf of Buyer.

  



  

; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
Sections 11.1(b), (c), (d) and (e) shall not be available to any party whose
breach of a representation,

  



        
   

  



  

warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement has been the cause of or
resulted in the failure of the applicable conditions to Closing to have been
fulfilled.

  



  

11.2 _Rights on Termination; Waiver_.

  



  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1 of this
Agreement, all further obligations of the parties under or pursuant to this
Agreement shall terminate without further liability of any party to the
others; provided that the obligations of the parties contained in Article X,
and Sections 3.2, 3.7, 11.2, 11.5, 11.6 and 11.12 **** of this Agreement
shall survive any such termination. The termination of this Agreement shall
not preclude a party from bringing an action against the other party for such
other partys willful breach of any covenant made by it under or pursuant to
this Agreement. If any of the conditions set forth in Article VII of this
Agreement have not been satisfied, Buyer may nevertheless elect to proceed
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
if any of the conditions set forth in Article VIII of this Agreement have not
been satisfied, Seller may nevertheless elect to proceed with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Any such
election to proceed shall be evidenced by a certificate signed on behalf of
the waiving party by an officer of that party, and shall release all claims
and actions the waiving party otherwise might have against the other party
under this Agreement on account of the failure of the condition so waived.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 11.2(a), if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1(e), Buyer shall pay to
Seller a fee of $6,000,000.00 (the "Termination Fee"), such Termination Fee
to be paid as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten Business
Days after termination.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Sellers right to receive the Termination Fee shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy, under this Agreement or otherwise, of Parent and Seller
against Buyer or its respective shareholders or any of their respective
affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers, employees or agents, for any
and all loss or damage suffered as a result of such termination.

  



  

11.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement and the documents
referred to in this Agreement and required to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties pertaining to the
subject matter of this Agreement and thereof, and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions of
the parties, whether oral or written.  There are no warranties,
representations or other agreements between the parties in connection with
the subject matter of this Agreement, except as specifically set forth in
this Agreement and any other contract, certificate or other document
identified in this Agreement that is to be signed or delivered at Closing. No
amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or termination of this Agreement
shall be binding unless executed in writing by Seller and Buyer.  No waiver
of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, whether or not
similar, nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver
unless otherwise expressly provided.

  



  

11.4 _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, each of the parties to this Agreement shall pay
the fees

  



        
   

  



  

and expenses of its respective counsel, accountants, brokers, consultants,
investment bankers and other experts incident to the negotiation and
preparation of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

11.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted
according to the internal Laws of the State of New York without regard to the
conflicts of Laws principles thereof.

  



  

11.6 _Assignment_. Prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not be assigned
by Seller or Buyer, except with the prior written consent of the other party.

  



  

11.7 _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be
given hereunder by any part to another party shall be in writing and shall be
deemed given when delivered personally, upon receipt of a transmission
confirmation (with a confirming copy sent by overnight courier) if sent by
