 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 2, 2012,
among KONINKLIJKE DSM N.V., a corporation organized in the Netherlands ("
_Parent_ "), BIOMEDICAL ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and
an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and KENSEY
NASH CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

_R ECITALS_

WHEREAS, the supervisory board and managing board of Parent (the "
_Supervisory Board and Managing Board_ ") and the respective Boards of
Directors of Merger Sub and the Company have approved the acquisition of the
Company by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement;

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent has agreed to cause Merger
Sub to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as
permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding (each, a " _Share_ " and,
collectively, the " _Shares_ ") at a price per Share of $38.50 (as such amount
may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.1(a)_ of this Agreement, the " _Offer
Price_ "), net to the seller in cash, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, the parties intend that Merger
Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the
Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), and each share of Company Common Stock that is not tendered and
accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be canceled and converted into
the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company and Merger Sub have (i)
determined that this Agreement and the Transactions (as defined below),
including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders and (ii) approved this Agreement
and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) (i) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with _Section 8.1_, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated by the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the
Offer; _provided_ , that the Offer shall be commenced no earlier than May 17,
2012, and in no event later than May 31, 2012. The obligations of Merger Sub
to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to
the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_  (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). Unless
extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
Offer shall expire on midnight (Eastern time) at the end of the day on the
20th Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) (such date, the "
_Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Date has
been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date to
which the Offer has been so extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement (the Initial Expiration Date or such other date to which the Offer
has been extended, is referred to as the " _Expiration Date_ "). Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right to waive any condition to the Offer or modify the
terms of the Offer, except that, without the prior written consent of the
Company, Merger Sub shall not (and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to) (A)
reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (B)
reduce the Offer Price, (C) waive the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in
_Exhibit A_ ), (D) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer that are
different than or in addition to the Offer Conditions or modify or amend any
Offer Condition in a manner adverse, or that reasonably would be expected to
be adverse, in a material respect to the holders of Company Common Stock, (E)
extend the Offer (except as required or permitted by the other provisions of
this _Section 1.1_), (F) change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer or (G) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse in a material
respect to the holders of Company Common Stock. As used in this Agreement, "
_Business Day_ " means "business day" as defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

(ii) Parent and Merger Sub agree that Merger Sub shall be permitted to
(without the consent of the Company), and shall (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to):

(A) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the
Offer; and

(B) if, on any scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not
satisfied and has not been waived, extend the Offer on one or more occasions
in consecutive increments of up to ten Business Days each (or such longer
period as the parties hereto may agree), until such time as such Offer
Conditions are satisfied;

 



2 _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) Merger Sub shall not be required to extend
the Offer beyond the Outside Date or the termination of this Agreement and
(2) if, at any expiration of the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions to the
Offer, except for the Minimum Tender Condition, are satisfied or have been
waived, Merger Sub shall only be required to extend the Offer for one or more
additional periods not to exceed an aggregate of ten Business Days.

(iii) If fewer than 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, then Merger Sub
may, and at the request of the Company, shall, and upon any such request of
the Company, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, make available a "subsequent
offering period" of not fewer than ten Business Days (or such shorter period
as shall be requested by the Company) in accordance with Rule 14d-11
promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
if the number of Shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and accepted
for payment pursuant to the Offer would, assuming the exercise of the Top-Up

thereof.

to the Effective

 



6  Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall
serve until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until such time as

Section 1.8 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 1.8(b)_ and _Section 1.8(c)_ and the conditions set
forth in this _Section 1.8(a)_, the Company grants to Merger Sub an
irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), for so long as this Agreement
has not been terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, to purchase from the
Company the number of authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock
(the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the exercise of the
Top-Up Option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding (the " _Number of Top-Up Option Shares_
"), assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The obligation of the
Company to issue and deliver the Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the
Top-Up Option is subject only to the conditions that (i) no Law, Judgment or
other legal restraint (excluding any listing requirement of any securities
exchange) that has the effect of preventing the exercise of the Top-Up Option
or the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such
exercise shall be in effect and (ii) the Number of Top-Up Option Shares shall
not exceed the aggregate of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
held as treasury shares by the Company and any Company Subsidiary plus (y) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is authorized
to issue under its certificate of incorporation but that are not issued and
outstanding (and are not reserved for issuance pursuant to the exercise of
Options), in each case, as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up
Option (and if such aggregate of (x) and (y) shall be less than the Number of
Top-Up Option Shares, then the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable).

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub, in whole but not in
part, at any time at or within three Business Days after the later of (i)
acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ") and
(ii) if applicable, the completion of any subsequent offering period for the
Offer pursuant to _Section 1.1(a)(iii)_. Any such exercise shall be
irrevocable, subject to the conditions set forth in _Section 1.8(a)_. The
aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares shall be
determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Option Shares by the
Offer Price, without interest. Such purchase price may be paid by Merger Sub,
at its election, either (i) entirely in cash or (ii) by paying in cash an
amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of such Top-Up Option
Shares and by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the balance of such purchase price, or by
any combination of cash and such promissory note. Any such promissory note
shall be full recourse against Parent and Merger Sub, be due one year from
the date the Top-Up Option Shares are issued and bear interest at the rate of
5% per annum and may be prepaid without premium or penalty.

 

(c) In the event that Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, it
shall deliver to the Company a notice (the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") setting forth

 



7  (i) the Number of Top-Up Option Shares that it shall purchase pursuant to
the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which it shall pay the applicable
purchase price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares by Merger Sub is to take place. The Top-
Up Notice shall also include an undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Sub
that as promptly following such exercise of the Top-Up Option as possible,
Merger Sub will consummate the Merger in accordance with Section 253 of the
DGCL as contemplated by _Section 6.1(b)_. At the closing of the purchase of
the Top-Up Option Shares, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, deliver to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in
exchange for such Top-Up Option Shares and the Company shall cause to be
issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing such shares. The parties
hereto agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up
Notice is deemed received by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1_, and as
close in time as possible on such day to the time of purchase of the Top-Up
Option Shares. The parties further agree to use their reasonable best efforts
to cause the Merger to be consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the
DGCL as contemplated by  _Section 6.1(b)_ as close in time as possible to
(including, to the extent possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the
Top-Up Option Shares. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate to
ensure that any issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished in a
manner consistent with all applicable Laws.

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ "), and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for
transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Merger Sub represent
and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or will be upon the purchase of
the Top-Up Option Shares, an "Accredited Investor," as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D under the Securities Act. Parent and Merger Sub agree that the
Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the
Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose
of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.

(e) The parties hereby agree and acknowledge that in any appraisal proceeding
with respect to the Appraisal Shares and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the fair value of the Appraisal Shares shall be determined in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") without regard to
the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Option Shares or any promissory note delivered
by Merger Sub to the Company in payment for the Top-Up Option Shares.

 



8 ARTICLE 2

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

 

CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Merger Sub capital stock, each
issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub capital stock shall be converted
into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

Section 2.2 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Company Common Stock:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Company Common Stock (including
each share of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award
immediately following the Acceptance Time, as contemplated by the Companys
Employee Incentive Compensation Plan and _Section 2.4(c)_) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares to
be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ and Appraisal Shares) shall be
canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive cash
in the amount of the Offer Price without interest thereon (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender
of such certificate in accordance with _Section 2.3_, without interest. The
shares of Company Common Stock that are so converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this  _Section 2.2(a)_ are referred to
herein as the " _Merger Shares_ ").

(b) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Without duplication to the effects
of _Section 1.1(a)(vi)_, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
appropriately and proportionately to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend (other
than the Declared Dividend), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the Acceptance Time and
prior to the Effective Time.

(c)  _Treasury Shares and Shares Owned by Parent_. Each share of Company
Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Company
Common Stock owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall
be made with respect thereto.

 



9 (d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.2(a)_, but rather any holder of Appraisal Shares shall
be entitled to be paid the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail
to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.2(a)_. The Company shall provide prompt notice to
Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and
that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), which
shall provide for the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration
(including each share of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to a Restricted
Stock Award immediately following the Acceptance Time, as contemplated by the
Companys Employee Incentive Compensation Plan and _Section 2.4(c)_), in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.3_. Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for payment by the Exchange
Agent in accordance with this _Article 2_ , the cash necessary to pay for the
shares of Company Common stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time but in any event not later than five Business Days thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") and to each holder of uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case whose shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.2_, (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or the Uncertificated Shares
shall pass, only upon delivery of

 



10  the Certificates or the transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to
such Persons, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock
represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (A) surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent (or in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit and bond, if
required, in the manner provided in _Section 2.3(f)_), together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, or (B) receipt of an "agents
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), in the case of a book-entry
transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Upon payment of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 2_ , each Certificate
or Uncertificated Share so surrendered or transferred shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered or the Uncertificated Shares so transferred is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer or such Uncertificated Shares shall be properly transferred and the
Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Each Certificate and
each Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon surrender in accordance with this
_Section 2.3_ the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall
have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.2_, except as otherwise
provided by applicable Law. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any
cash payable to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article 2_.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
transfer of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_Article 2_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, _subject_ ,
_however_ , to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or
make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time
that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the
date of this Agreement and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after
the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 2_ , except as otherwise
provided by Law.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
for nine months after

 



11  the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article 2_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of their claim for Merger Consideration.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any
amounts payable pursuant to this _Article 2_ would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority (as defined in  _Section
3.3(d)_), any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent in its reasonable discretion, the posting by such Person
of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant
to this Agreement.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement (including the Offer) to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock (including each share of Company Common Stock
issued pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award immediately following the
Acceptance Time, as contemplated by the Companys Employee Incentive
Compensation Plan and _Section 2.4(c)_), Options or Stock Appreciation Rights
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the applicable Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, (i) they shall be paid to the appropriate taxing
authorities, and (ii) such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock (including each share of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to
a Restricted Stock Award immediately following the Acceptance Time, as
contemplated by the Companys Employee Incentive Compensation Plan and
_Section 2.4(c)_), Stock Appreciation Rights or Options in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.4 _Options; Stock Appreciation Rights; Restricted Stock Awards_.

 

(a) Parent shall not assume or otherwise replace any Options, Restricted Stock
Awards, Stock Appreciation Rights or other equity awards granted pursuant to
the Stock Plans in connection with the Transactions. As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the board of directors of the Company
(the " _Company Board_ ") or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Stock Plans, shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to provide that, at the Effective Time, and without
any action on the part of any holder thereof, each Option that is outstanding
and unexercised, whether vested or unvested (in whole or in part),
exercisable or unexercisable (in whole or in

 



12  part), immediately prior to the Effective Time shall terminate and be
canceled at the Effective Time and each holder of an Option will be entitled
to receive from Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and shall
receive as soon as practicable following the Effective Time in settlement of
each Option a Cash Amount. For purposes of this subsection (a), the " _Option
Cash Amount_ " shall be equal to the net amount of (A) the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of such Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares subject to such
Option, less (B) any applicable withholdings for Taxes. If the exercise price
per share of any Option equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, the Cash
Amount therefor shall be zero. As used in this Agreement, " _Options_ " means
any option granted, and, immediately before the Effective Time not exercised,

ARTICLE 6

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 6.1 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock
is required by Law, the Company shall, at Parents request, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Acceptance Time, prepare and file with
the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and each of the Company and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly
as practicable to any comments of the SEC and its staff with respect thereto.
The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of
the Required Company Stockholder Vote there shall occur any event that is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement,
the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such an
amendment or supplement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of Company Common Stock
as promptly as practicable after filing with the SEC.

 



44 (b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock
is required by Law, the Company shall, at Parents request, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Acceptance Time, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company
Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Required Company
Stockholder Vote. Unless the Company Board has withdrawn its recommendation of
this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions in compliance with
_Section 6.8(b)_, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the vote or consent of the holders of Company Common Stock required by
applicable Law to effect the Merger. Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has
been called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Parent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except (i) for the absence of a quorum
or (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which it believes in good faith is
necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the holders of Company Common
Stock prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Parent, Merger Sub and any other Parent Subsidiary shall
collectively acquire or hold at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the
Company Common Stock, the parties shall take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
reasonably practicable after the expiration of the Offer without a
stockholders meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 

(c) Parent shall cause all shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant
to the Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary to be voted in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement.

Section 6.2  _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor the Employee Benefit
Plans set forth on _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "
_Continuing Plans_ ") in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
prior to the date hereof, _provided_ that, subject to _Section 6.2(b)_,
nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from
terminating or amending any such Continuing Plans, arrangements or agreements
in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by applicable Law.

(b) Through December 31, 2012, Parent agrees to provide or cause the Company
to provide employees of the Company and each Company Subsidiary with (i) the
benefit of the Continuing Plans at benefit levels that are no less than those
in effect on the date of this Agreement and (ii) salary and employee benefits
(excluding any equity based compensation) in the aggregate no less favorable
than those currently provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
such employees (in case of benefits, such employees considered as a 

 



45  group); _provided_ that Parent shall be under no obligation to retain any
employee or group of employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
other than as required by applicable Law. 

(c) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained by or contributed to by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries in
which Company Employees participate (including, after the Closing, employees
of the Surviving Corporation), Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, cause each such plan, program or arrangement to treat the pre-Effective
Time service with the Company and its affiliates of each individual who is an
employee or former employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing (a " _Company Employee_ ") (to the
same extent such service is recognized under analogous plans, programs or
arrangements of the Company or its affiliates prior to the Closing) as service
rendered to Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for
purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting thereunder (but not
benefit accrual); _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service
shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of such benefit.
Company Employees shall also be given credit for any deductible or co-payment
amounts paid in respect of the plan year in which the Closing occurs, to the
extent that, following the Closing, they participate in any other plan for
which deductibles or co-payments are required. Parent shall also cause each
Employee Benefit Plan maintained by or contributed to by Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) in
which Company Employees participate, to waive any preexisting condition that
was waived under the terms of any Company Employee Benefit Plan immediately
prior to the Closing, and to waive any waiting period limitation which would
otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee on or after the Closing. Parent
shall recognize any accrued but unused personal days, vacation and sick leave
of the Company employees as of the Closing Date, in accordance with the terms
of such Company policies and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide such personal days, vacation and sick leave in accordance with the
terms of such Company policies but in no event will Parent be obligated to
extend or enlarge the benefits available under such Company policies.

 

(d) If the Effective Time occurs prior to the payment of bonuses under the
Companys fiscal year 2012 employee bonus plan covering the period from July
1, 2011 through June 30, 2012 (the " _2012 Bonus Plan_ "), then effective as
of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall assume and continue the
2012 Bonus Plan and pay to the Company Employees, at the time set forth
below, any amounts due but not yet paid thereunder as of the Effective Time,
determined as follows. No later than the earlier of (i) the Acceptance Time
and (ii) June 21, 2012, the Company Board shall determine the size of the
bonus pool and the allocation of such bonus pool (the " _2012 Bonus Payments_
") based on the criteria disclosed to Parent in the Company Employee Benefit
Plans as in effect on the date hereof, in a manner that is consistent with
past practice, based on actual Company performance results for the period
beginning on July 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012 and a good faith determination
of forecasted results for the period beginning June 1, 2012 through June 30,
2012; _provided_ , that in all events, the 2012 Bonus Payments shall not
exceed $2 million, in the aggregate. Prior to any communication of the amounts
of the 2012 Bonus Payments to the Company Employees, Parent shall have a
reasonable opportunity to review such determinations and the applicable
underlying data. The 2012 Bonus Payments will be paid no later than the
earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after the Effective Time and (B) October 1,
2012. 

 



46  For the avoidance of doubt, (1) if the Merger is not consummated by
September 30, 2012, the Company will be entitled to make the 2012 Bonus
Payments (determined as described above) on October 1, 2012, and (2) the
Company shall not adopt any employee bonus plan or set performance targets
under any existing employee bonus plan for fiscal year 2013.

(e) This _Section 6.2_ shall inure exclusively to the benefit of, and be
binding solely upon, the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors, permitted assigns, executors and legal representatives. Nothing
in this _Section 6.2_, expressed or implied, shall be construed to create any
third-party beneficiary rights in any present or former employee, service
provider, or any such Persons alternate payees, dependents or beneficiaries,
whether in respect of continued employment or resumed employment,
compensation, benefits, terms of employment, or otherwise.

(f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to create any right to employment or
continued employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with
Parent or any of its Affiliates. Nothing in this  _Section 6.2_ or any other
provision of this Agreement shall be construed to establish, amend or modify
any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

 

Section 6.3 _Antitrust Filings_.

(a) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall each, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, file or cause to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission (the
" _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the
filings and other materials required under the HSR Act, or any other
applicable antitrust or competition Laws in order to consummate this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, and the Transactions. Parent shall pay
directly to the applicable Governmental Authority the applicable filing fee
required in connection with the filings and other materials required under the
HSR Act, or any other applicable antitrust or competition Laws in
connection with the Transactions.

(b) To the extent permissible under applicable Laws, (i) Parent and the
Company shall cooperate with each other and shall furnish to the other party

resolving or terminating any inquiry or requests for additional information
made by the FTC or the DOJ or other Governmental Authority under applicable
antitrust or competition Laws, (ii) each of the parties shall promptly inform
the other parties of any communication with, and any proposed understanding,
undertaking or agreement with, the FTC or the DOJ or any such other
Governmental Authority regarding any such filing, notification or submission
or the Transactions, (iii) Parent and the Company shall give each other
reasonable notice of and the opportunity to participate in any meeting or
telephone conversation with the FTC, the DOJ or any such other Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filing, notification or submission or the
Transactions and (iv) the parties will timely consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, documents, arguments, opinions, proposals, submissions or
other responses made or provided by or on behalf of any party in connection
with all meetings, actions and proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or
other applicable antitrust or competition Laws.

 



47 Section 6.4 _Public Statements_. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries, shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other announcement (including written communications with
Company Employees) with respect to the Offer, the Merger or the Transactions
without providing a meaningful opportunity to the other parties to review and
comment upon such press release or other announcement and shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto; _provided, however_ , that the party seeking to issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the
Offer, the Merger or the Transactions shall not be required to provide any
such review or comment to the other party in connection with any disclosure
contemplated by _Section 6.8_. Attached hereto as (a) _Exhibit D_ is the
press release to be issued by the Company in connection with the execution of
this Agreement and announcement of the Transactions, (b) _Exhibit E_ is the
press release to be issued by the Company reporting the Companys financial
results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 and (c) _Exhibit F_ is the
press release to be issued by Parent in connection with the execution of this
Agreement and announcement of the Transactions.

Section 6.5 _Standard of Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions
provided herein, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, such action, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, such things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective in the most expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) obtaining all permits,
consents, approvals, authorizations and actions or nonactions required for or
in connection with the consummation by the parties hereto of the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions, (ii) the taking of such commercially
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or
to avoid an action or proceeding by, a Governmental Authority, (iii) the
obtaining of all necessary consents from third parties, (iv) contesting
and resisting, and seeking to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned,
any Judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts,
prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions and (v) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes
of this Agreement. The Company shall have the right to review, comment on and
approve in advance all characterizations of the information relating to the
Company; Parent shall have the right to review, comment on and approve in
advance all characterizations of the information relating to Parent or Merger
Sub; and each of the Company and Parent shall have the right to review and
approve in advance all characterizations of the information relating to the
Transactions, in each case which appear in any material filing (including the
Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement) made in
connection with the Transactions. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree
that they shall consult and cooperate with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all such necessary permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities and in
promptly making all necessary filings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company and the Company Board shall not be restricted from taking any action
permitted by _Section 6.8_.

 

Section 6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Parent
agrees to give prompt notice to the other of (i) any written notice received
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person

 



48  is required in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any notice from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or (iii) any fact,
event or circumstance known to it that is reasonably likely, individually or
taken together with all other existing facts, events and circumstances known
to it, to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth on _Exhibit
A_ or in _Article 7_ to be satisfied  _provided_ , that the failure to
deliver any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall not be considered in
determining whether the conditions set forth on _Exhibit A_ or in _Article 7_
have been satisfied. In no event shall the delivery of any notice by a party
pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ limit or otherwise affect the respective
rights, obligations, remedies, representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

Section 6.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary and the officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company
and each Company Subsidiary, to, afford the officers, employees and agents of
Parent and Merger Sub, at their sole cost and risk, reasonable access during
normal business hours from the date hereof through the Effective Date to its
officers, employees, agents, properties, facilities, books, records, Contracts
and other assets and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub all financial,
operating and other data and information as Parent and Merger Sub through
their officers, employees or agents, may reasonably request; provided,
however, that the Company may, after consultation with its outside counsel,
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the
extent that: (i) based on the advice of such counsel, the Company reasonably
concludes access to such documents or information would give rise to a waiver
of the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege between attorney and client applicable to such documents or
information; (ii) access to a Contract to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound would violate in a material respect
or cause a material default under, or give a third party the right
to terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract (it being agreed
that, if requested by Parent, (A) the Company will seek the consent of the
relevant third party to permit Parent to have access to such Contract or (B)
the Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to design and implement
alternative procedures to enable Parent to evaluate any such Contract without
causing a violation or causing a default thereunder or giving any third party
a right to terminate or accelerate the rights thereunder); or (iii) such
disclosure relates to individual performance or personnel evaluation records,
medical histories or other personnel information, and based on the advice of
such counsel, the Company reasonably concludes that such access would
constitute a violation of Law by the Company or any Company Subsidiary; and
provided further, that nothing in this _Section 6.7_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed to require the Company or its Representatives to
prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.7_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or
create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. Any access to the Companys properties
shall be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements and shall not include the right to perform invasive testing.

 



49 (b) The provisions of the Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement dated as
of November 14, 2011, between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms and apply to any information provided by the Company to Parent or Merger
Sub under this Agreement.

Section 6.8 _No Solicitation; Company Recommendation_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier,
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company
shall not, shall cause each Company Subsidiary and each officer, director or
employee of the Company or of Company Subsidiary not to, and shall not
authorize or knowingly permit any financial advisor, attorney or other advisor
or representative (a _"Representative_ ") of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly
encourage the submission of, any Takeover Proposal (as hereinafter
defined), (ii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information with respect
to, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal or (iii)
release any third party from any confidentiality agreement entered into in
connection with any Takeover Proposal or potential Takeover Proposal or any
standstill agreement or standstill provision to which the Company is a party
or fail to reasonably enforce or grant any material waiver, request or
consent to any Takeover Proposal under, any such agreement or the Rights
Agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and the
Companys and each such Company Subsidiarys respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and promptly terminate any existing solicitation, activity,
discussion or negotiation heretofore conducted by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or their respective Representatives with respect to any
Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly after the date of this
Agreement instruct each Person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement relating to any Takeover Proposal with or for the benefit of the
Company to promptly return or destroy all information, documents and
materials relating to a Takeover Proposal or to the Company or its businesses,
operations or affairs heretofore furnished by the Company or any of its
Representatives to such Person or any of its Representatives in accordance
with the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person. It is
understood that any violation of the restrictions of this _Section 6.8(a)_ in
any material respect by any Representative of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 6.8(a)_ by the Company
if the Company does not cure any such violation within three Business Days
following the date on which the Company obtains knowledge of such violation.

(b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in _Section 6.8(a)_, if, prior
to the Acceptance Time, in response to an unsolicited written Takeover
Proposal received after the date of this Agreement from a third party that has
not resulted from a breach or violation of _Section 6.8(a)_ and that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) is, or would reasonably be expected to
result in or lead to, a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined) and that
the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law, the Company and its Representatives may, subject to the
Company giving Parent at least 48 hours prior written notice (which notice
shall contain the

 



50  identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal, a copy of the Takeover
Proposal if it is in writing or otherwise a description of the material terms
and conditions thereto and a statement to the effect that the Company Board
has made the determination required by this _Section 6.8(b)_ in respect
thereof and the Company intends to furnish non-public information to, or enter
into discussions or negotiations with, such Person making such Takeover
Proposal) prior to taking the actions in clause (i) or (ii) of this clause
(b), and in any event shall not take any of such actions with respect to a
Takeover Proposal within the twenty-four hours immediately following delivery
of the notice provided by the Company to Parent pursuant to the last sentence
of _Section 6.8(g)_ in respect of such Takeover Proposal, (i) furnish
information with respect to the Company and each Company Subsidiary to
the Person making such Takeover Proposal and its representatives pursuant to
a confidentiality agreement containing terms no less favorable, in the
aggregate, to the Company than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
(except that such confidentiality agreement shall contain additional
provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the provisions of
this _Section 6.8_), _provided_ , that a copy of all such information is
delivered substantially concurrently to Parent to the extent it has not
previously been so furnished to Parent and (ii) engage in such negotiations or
discussions with the third party that made such Takeover Proposal as the
Company Board shall determine (including solicitation of a revised Takeover
Proposal from such third party).

(c) Except as otherwise permitted by  _Section 6.8(d)_, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, modify, change or
amend (or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify, modify, change or amend) in
any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub (including pursuant to the
Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement or any amendment thereto), the Company
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Takeover Proposal, (iii) release any Person from any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company is a party and
which relates to a potential Takeover Proposal, or fail to enforce, or grant
any waiver, request or consent to any Takeover Proposal under such agreement
or the Rights Agreement (any of the foregoing in clause (i), (ii) or (iii), a
_"Company Change in Recommendation_ ") or (iv) authorize the Company to, and
the Company shall not, enter into any agreement, agreement-in-principle or
letter of intent with respect to, or accept, any Takeover Proposal.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this  _Section 6.8_ or anything else
contained herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if
the Company Board (or the applicable committee thereof) has received a
Takeover Proposal (that has not been withdrawn) that constitutes a Superior
Proposal and such Takeover Proposal shall not have resulted from a breach or
violation of the terms of _Section 6.8(a)_, the Company Board (or the
applicable committee thereof) may (i) make a Company Change
in Recommendation, and/or (ii) to the extent permitted by _Section
8.1(e)(i)_, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement to authorize and
allow the Company substantially concurrently to enter into a binding written
agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal if:



     | (A) | the Company Board (or the applicable committee thereof)
determines in good faith (after consultation with financial advisors and
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to violate the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law; 
---|---|--- 
 



51 Company shall have (x) provided to Parent a written notice, which notice shall
(1) state that the Company has received a Takeover Proposal which the Company
has determined is a Superior Proposal and that the Company intends to take
such action and (2) include the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal, the most current written draft agreement relating to the
transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal and all related
transaction agreements to which the Company would be a party, and (y) given
such notice to Parent at least three Business Days prior to taking any such
action (it being understood that any material amendment to the terms of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new three Business Day
period) and given Parent during such three Business Day period the opportunity
to meet or negotiate with the Company Board and its outside legal counsel
(and, if Parent has so requested, shall have met and negotiated with Parent in
good faith) with respect to any modification of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement proposed by Parent that, if made, would obviate the need for
the Company to take the actions specified in clauses (d)(i) or (d)(ii) above;
and 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | Parent shall not have made, within three Business Days after
receipt of such notice, a proposal to amend the terms contemplated by this
Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with financial advisors and outside legal counsel) is at least as favorable
from a financial point of view to the Companys stockholders as such Superior
Proposal. 
---|---|--- 
 

The Company Board may also make a Company Change in Recommendation at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time in the absence of a Takeover Proposal if
a material event or change in circumstances has occurred after the date
hereof that was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company prior to
the date hereof and the Company Board (or the applicable committee thereof)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to violate the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law. 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.8_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the holders of Company Common
Stock a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party
pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or (ii) making any disclosure to the holders
of Company Common Stock, if in the good faith judgment of the Company Board
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel), failure to do so would
violate its obligations under applicable Law (including the Company Boards
duties of good faith and candor to the holders of Company Common Stock),
subject to compliance with any applicable requirements of this _Section 6.8_.
For the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section 6.8(e)_ shall not limit any of
Parents rights under _Article 8_ in respect of any such position taken or
disclosure made.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
(other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates) relating to 

 



52  any acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, share exchange,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, direct or indirect business
combination, asset acquisition, exclusive license, tender or exchange offer
or other similar transaction involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary
of (A) the assets or businesses that constitute or represent 25% or more of
the total revenue, operating income, or assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) 25% or more of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or any other Company capital stock or capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interests in, any Company Subsidiary directly
or indirectly holding, individually or taken together, the assets or business
referred to in clause (A) above, in each case other than the Transactions, (C)
pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company immediately preceding
such transaction hold less than 75% of the voting equity interest in the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or (D) any combination of
the foregoing.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer in respect of a
Takeover Proposal (provided, that for the purposes of this definition all
references to 25% in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be replaced by
references to a "majority" and all references to 75% shall be to 50%) received
by the Company after the date hereof (A) that is not the result of a breach
or violation of _Section 6.8(a)_ of this Agreement and (B) on terms that the
Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
financial advisors and outside legal counsel), taking into account all
relevant factors, including the price, form of consideration, closing
conditions, the ability to finance the proposal, the identity of the Person or
Persons making the proposal and other aspects of the proposal that the
Company Board deems relevant, (1) would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
holders of Company Common Stock than the Transactions (including the terms of
any proposal by Parent to modify the terms of the Transactions) and (2) is
reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed in a timely fashion.

(g) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 6.8_, the Company shall promptly, and in any case within twenty-four
hours of its receipt, advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for
information with respect to any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry with respect
to or which could reasonably be expected to result in a Takeover Proposal, and
the material terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal or
inquiry, including the identity of the Person or group making any such
Takeover Proposal and a copy of all written materials provided in connection
with such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent informed on
a reasonably current basis of the status and material terms and conditions
(including all amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Takeover
Proposal or inquiry and shall immediately provide to Parent a copy of all
written materials subsequently provided to or by the Company in connection
with such Takeover Proposal. In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall
provide Parent with at least forty-eight hours prior notice of a meeting of
the Company Board (or such lesser notice as is provided to the members of the
Company Board) at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider a
Takeover Proposal (which notice may run concurrently with the other notice
provisions provided in this _Section 6.8_). 

 



53 (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 6.8_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, if the Company receives a written Takeover
Proposal from any Person, the Company and/or its Representatives may contact
such Person to clarify the terms thereof.

 

Section 6.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification by the
Company now existing in favor of each individual who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time
an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or an employee
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or who acts as a fiduciary under any
of the Company Employee Benefit Plans (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as
provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, in each case
as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other
agreements in effect on the date hereof, including provisions relating to the
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit, shall
survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect and the
Surviving Corporation shall honor and fulfill in all material respects such
rights to indemnification. In addition, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to
the Indemnified Parties as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Company as of the date hereof, and during such six-year period, such
provisions shall not be repealed, materially amended or otherwise modified in
any material respect except as required by applicable Law.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Companys officers and
directors liability insurance policies, in effect on the date of this
Agreement (the " _D andO Insurance_"), for a period of not less than six years
after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or
omissions prior to the Effective Time; provided that (i) the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts, in the aggregate, and containing terms no less advantageous to such
former directors or officers and (ii) such substitution shall not result in
gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 300%
of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the "
_Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant to this
_Section 6.9_; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the amount of the annual
premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Amount, the Surviving Corporation shall procure and maintain for such
six-year period as much coverage as reasonably practicable for the Maximum
Amount. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the Company may, without Parents prior consent,
purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance at a cost per
year covered for such tail policy not to exceed the Maximum Amount, and such
"tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this _Section 6.9(b)_.

 



54 (c) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 6.9(a)_,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party from and against, and
advance expenses to each Indemnified Party in respect of, any costs, fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the
extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises out of (i) any
action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Partys
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries (regardless of whether such action or omission, or
alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the
Effective Time), or (ii) any of the Transactions; provided, however, that if,
at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Party delivers to Parent or the Surviving Corporation a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this _Section 6.9(c)_,
then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved; and provided further, however, that no Indemnified Party
shall enter into any such settlement without the prior written consent of the
Surviving Corporation (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned). In the event of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, (A) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right
to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood
that, by electing to control the defense thereof, subject to the terms and
conditions of this _Section 6.9(c)_, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed
to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Partys entitlement to
indemnification hereunder with respect thereto); (B) in the event
the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, after consultation with his or
her own counsel, that there is an actual or potential material conflict of
interest arising in connection with Parents controlling such defense, such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether
or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any
such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry; (C) the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
promptly after statements therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation elects to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry; and (D) no Indemnified Party shall be liable for
any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such
settlement provides for any remedy other than the payment of money damages
that are paid by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to its indemnification
obligations set forth herein.

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party to whom this _Section 6.9_ applies without the consent of such
affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this _Section 6.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries
of this _Section 6.9_, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this
_Section 6.9_). The rights of the Indemnified Persons under this _Section
6.9_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
that such individuals may have under the certificates of incorporation,
bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all
indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 



55 (e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to, or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to DandO Insurance claims under any policy
that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this _Section 6.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such
claims under such policies.

 

Section 6.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.4_ and any other
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with the Merger by each individual who is
an officer or director of the Company and subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.11 _Directors_.

(a) Subject to applicable Law and Nasdaq rules applicable to the Company,
promptly upon the Acceptance Time and as long as Parent directly or indirectly
beneficially owns not less than a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate such
number of directors on the Company Board as will give Merger Sub
representation on the Company Board equal to at least that number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that is the product of (i)
the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the
directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage
that (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub or
any other subsidiary of Parent bears to (B) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding, and the Company shall,
at such time, promptly take all necessary action to cause Merger Subs
designees to be so elected; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that
Merger Subs designees are appointed or elected to the Company Board, until
the Effective Time the Company Board shall have at least two directors who
are directors on the date of this Agreement and who are not officers of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (the " _Independent Directors_ "); and
_provided, further,_ that, in such event, if the number of Independent
Directors shall be reduced below two for any reason whatsoever, the remaining
Independent Director shall be entitled to designate individuals to fill such
vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of
this Agreement or, if no Independent Directors then remain, the other
directors shall designate two individuals to fill such vacancies who are not
officers, stockholders or affiliates of the Company, any Company Subsidiary,
Parent or Merger Sub, and such individuals shall be deemed to be Independent
Directors for purposes of this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing,
the Company shall promptly, at the option of Merger Sub, take all necessary
action to 

 



56  either increase the size of the Company Board or obtain the resignation of
such number of its current directors as is necessary to enable Merger Subs
designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board as provided above.
At such time, the individuals designated by Merger Sub shall, as nearly as
practicable, constitute at least the same percentage as individuals designated
by Merger Sub of the Company Board of (1) each committee of the Company
Board, (2) each board of directors of each Company Subsidiary, and (3) each
committee of each such board, in each case only to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and the listing requirements of Nasdaq. Parent shall cause any
individual designated by Parent for appointment to the Company Board upon the
Acceptance Time as provided in this _Section 6.11(a)_, to timely (i) furnish
(A) a completed director and officer questionnaire with respect to the
background and qualifications of such person, substantially in the form
provided to and requested to be completed by the then current members of the
Company Board, and (B) if requested by the Company Board (or the
corporate governance and nominating committee thereof), such designees
consent to the Companys engaging in a background check of such designee
(including through a third party investigation firm), and information
reasonably necessary to complete such a background check, in a manner
consistent with background checks customarily engaged in by the Company for
prospective new members of the Company Board, and (ii) such other information
as may be reasonably requested by the Company Board (and/or the corporate
governance and nominating committee thereof). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.11(a)_, in the event that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consideration by the corporate governance and
nominating committee of the Company Board and consultation with outside legal
counsel, that its appointment of a particular designee of Parent would
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders,
then the Company Board shall inform Parent of such determination in writing
and explain in reasonable detail the basis for such determination and shall
not appoint such particular designee to the Company Board but rather shall
appoint another individual designated for appointment to the Company Board by
Parent (subject in each case to the provisions of this _Section 6.11(a)_).

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint designees to the Company Board shall
be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated
thereunder. The Company shall take all actions required pursuant to Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-l in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section
6.11_ on or prior to the Acceptance Time and shall, not later than 10 calendar
days prior to the Expiration Date, mail the Information Statement to the
holders of Company Common Stock and file the Information Statement with the
SEC (which, at the Companys election, may be included in the mailing of the
Schedule 14D-9 or mailed separately). Parent shall supply to the Company in
writing any information with respect to itself, Merger Sub and their
respective nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1, including for inclusion in the Information Statement. 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Merger Subs designees pursuant
to this _Section 6.11_, the approval by affirmative vote or written consent
of all of the Independent Directors then in office (or, if there shall be only
one Independent Director then in office, the Independent Director) shall be
required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the
authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the part of the
Company, including any action by any committee thereof or any other director
of the Company, shall, unless otherwise required by Law, be required
or permitted to authorize) (i) any amendment or termination of this Agreement
by the Company, (ii) any extension of time for performance of

 



57  any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, (iii) any waiver
or exercise of any of the Companys rights under this Agreement, (iv) any
amendment of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company if
such amendment would adversely affect the holders of Company Common Stock
(other than Parent and Merger Sub), or (v) any action of the Company Board
under or in connection with the Agreement if such action would adversely
affect, or would reasonably likely to adversely affect, the holders of Company
Common Stock (other than Parent and Merger Sub). The Independent Directors
shall have the authority to retain such counsel and other advisors, in each
case, reasonably acceptable to Parent (it being understood that retaining
current counsel to the Company shall be deemed reasonably acceptable), at the
reasonable expense of the Company for the purpose of fulfilling their
obligations hereunder, and shall have the authority following the election of
Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 6.11(a)_, to
institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

Section 6.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
brought by stockholders of the Company against the Company and/or its
directors relating to the Transactions and the Company shall not compromise,
settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or
come to an arrangement regarding any litigation arising or resulting from the
Transactions or consent to the same without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

Section 6.13 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 6.14 _Takeover Laws_. The Company shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (i) to take all actions necessary so that no Takeover Law
becomes applicable to the Transactions and (ii) if any such Takeover Law
becomes applicable to the Transactions, take all actions necessary so that the
Transactions contemplated may be consummated as promptly as practicable.

 

Section 6.15 _Approval of Compensation Arrangements_. The parties acknowledge
that certain payments are to be made and certain benefits are to be granted
under or in accordance with employment, compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangements of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, including the Employee Benefit Plans, to
holders of Company Common Stock (with all such plans and arrangements being
collectively referred to as the " _Company Arrangements_ "). Prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company shall take any action necessary to ensure that
any Company Arrangements (including any Company Arrangements entered into
after the date hereof) have been approved as contemplated by Rule 14d-10 under
the Exchange Act.

 



58 Section 6.16 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. After the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and rules and policies of
Nasdaq to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company
Common Stock from Nasdaq and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock
under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in any event no more than ten days thereafter.

applicable Law on or prior to October 31, 2012 (the " _Outside Date_ ");
or (ii) the Offer is terminated or withdrawn pursuant to its terms and the

accepted for purchase thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under either clause of this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall
not be available to the party whose failure to fulfill in any material respect
any of its obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the event specified in such clause;

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if any Judgment is issued or Law is
enacted by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction that
permanently prohibits or makes the Merger or the Offer illegal which is in
effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ that the

shall have used those efforts required hereunder (including under _Section
6.5_) to resist, lift or resolve such Judgment or Law;

(d) by Parent prior to the Acceptance Time, if:

(i) the Company Board or any Committee thereof shall have effected a Company
Change in Recommendation (whether or not in compliance with _Section 6.8_)
(provided, that Parents right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this 
_Section 8.1(d)(i)_ in respect of a Company Change in Recommendation will
expire ten Business Days after the last date upon which the Company Board
makes such Company Change in Recommendation);

of the Company Recommendation;

 

(iv) the Company shall have violated or breached (or, subject to the right to
cure provided in the last sentence of  _Section 6.8(a)_, be deemed pursuant
to the terms thereof, to have violated or breached) in any material respect
any provision of _Section 6.8_; or

 



60 (v) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A)
would give rise to the failure of an Offer Condition specified in paragraphs
(D) or (E) of _Exhibit A_ and (B) is incapable of being cured or has not been
cured by the Company within 30 calendar days after written notice has been
given by Parent to the Company of such breach or failure to perform;

 

(e) by the Company, if

(i) prior to the Acceptance Time, in order to substantially concurrently enter
into a binding written agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a
Superior Proposal pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 6.8(d)_ and
prior to or simultaneously with such termination, the Company pays to Parent
by wire transfer in immediately available funds the Termination Fee required

(B) is incapable of being cured or has not been cured by Parent within 30
calendar days after written notice has been given by the Company to Parent of
such breach or failure to perform.

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall give written notice of

void except for the provisions of (i) this _Section 8.2_, (ii) _Section
8.3_, (iii) _Section 6.4_, (iv) the last sentence of _Section 6.6_, (v)
_Section 6.7(b)_ and (vi) _Article 9_ , which shall survive such
termination; _provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve any party from
liability for any willful or intentional material breach by such party of
this Agreement prior to such termination. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
not be affected by the termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(i)_, prior
to, or simultaneously with, and as a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination, the Company shall pay Parent a fee in immediately available
funds in the amount of $12,600,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ").

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_
(other than pursuant to clauses (iv) or (v) thereof), then the Company shall
promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day after termination of
this Agreement, pay Parent the Termination Fee.

 



61 (c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_,  _Section
8.1(d)(iv)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(v)_ and (i) at any time on or after the date
hereof and prior to such termination a Takeover Proposal shall have been made
to the Company Board or the Company or publicly announced and, in each case,
not publicly withdrawn prior to such termination, and (ii) within twelve
months after the date of such termination, (A) the Company enters into a
Contract providing for any transaction specified in the definition
of "Takeover Proposal" or (B) any such transaction is consummated then the
Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee on the first Business Day after
such event. For purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)_, "Takeover Proposal" shall
have the meaning ascribed thereto in _Section 6.8(f)_ except that references
in _Section 6.8(f)_ to "25%" and "75%" shall be replaced by "a majority" and
"50%", respectively.

(d) In no event shall more than one Termination Fee be payable hereunder.

 

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that without such
provisions Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement.
If the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee or any portion thereof and
Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a Judgment against
the Company for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, the Company shall
pay Parent and Merger Sub their costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the Termination Fee (or any portion thereof that has not been
paid timely in accordance with this Agreement) and on the amount of such costs
and expenses at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 6.3_ and this _Section 8.3_, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated.

 

(g) In the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is paid in accordance
with this _Section 8.3_, Parents receipt of the Termination Fee from the
Company pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and
each of their respective former, current and future directors, officers,
employees, agents, general and limited partners, managers, members,
stockholders, Affiliates and assignees and each former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, stockholder, general or limited partner,
manager, member, stockholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Company Parties_ ") for any loss or damage suffered as a
result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder, and no Company Party shall have any other
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Companys
liability for the Companys willful or intentional material breach of any of
its covenants or agreements in this Agreement be limited (it being understood
and agreed that the failure to consummate the Transactions in the event that
all of the conditions to Closing have been satisfied or waived in accordance
with this Agreement shall be deemed a willful or intentional material breach
of this Agreement).

 



62 Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 6.11_, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, at any time before or after approval of this
Agreement and the Transactions by the respective Boards of Directors or
stockholders of the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment
shall be made which under the DGCL requires further approval by such
stockholders without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. Subject to _Section 6.11_, any failure of any of the
parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein
may be waived at any time prior to the Effective Time by any of the parties
entitled to the benefit thereof only by a written instrument signed by each
such party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligation, representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

defined, in this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with GAAP. When a
reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Exhibits, such reference
shall be to a Section or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The use
of the words "or," "either," and "any" shall not be exclusive or limiting
in nature. Any references in this Agreement to "the date hereof" refers to
the date of execution of this Agreement. The headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that
they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation, drafting,
preparation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the

such agreement or document. All references to this Agreement shall be deemed
to include references to the "plan of merger" contained herein (as such term
is used in the DGCL).

 



64 Section 9.5 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the Laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof to the extent
they would result in the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any Federal court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware, or, if neither the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware nor
any such Federal court has jurisdiction, a Delaware state court, in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any Judgment relating
thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts,
(ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in such Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such state
court does not have proper jurisdiction, in such Federal court, or if such
Federal court does not have jurisdiction either, in such Delaware state court,
(iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action or proceeding in any such Delaware Court of Chancery or Federal
court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in
any such Delaware Court of Chancery or Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final Judgment in any such action or proceeding shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
Judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in  _Section 9.1_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(c) Each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably waives any and all right
to trial by jury in any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions.

 

Section 9.6 _Counterparts; Facsimile Transmission of Signatures_. This
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, and delivered by means of facsimile
transmission or other electronic transmission, each of which when so executed
and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 9.7 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. 

(a) This Agreement and all of the provisions hereto shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors

 



65  and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations set forth herein shall be assigned by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any
purported assignment without such consent shall be void.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving any Person, other
than the parties hereto and their heirs, successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Agreement or any provision hereof or as creating or amending any employee
benefit plan, except that from and after the Closing (i) the holders of
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights are intended third party beneficiaries
of the provisions of _Section 2.4_, (ii) each Indemnified Party is an
intended third party beneficiary of _Section 6.9_, and such Persons may
specifically enforce such provisions and (iii) from and after the Effective
Time, the rights of holders of shares of the Company Common Stock to receive
the Merger Consideration, as set forth in _Article 2_.

Section 9.8 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable
under any applicable Law, all other provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Offer or the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse in
any material respect to any party. Upon such determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Offer and the
Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible then such contravention or
invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement.

Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement
contain all of the terms of the understandings of the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all other representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

 

Section 9.10 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to equitable
relief without the requirement of posting a bond or other security or proving
economic damages, including to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above.

[Signature Page to Agreement and Plan of Merger] _Exhibit A_

Conditions of the Offer

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer but subject to the terms set
forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger
Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock
promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer) (the " _Payment
Rules_ "), to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to
the Offer, if

(i) there shall not have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of Shares which would
represent at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock on a fully diluted basis (which total number shall be equal to
the number of Shares _plus_ the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise or conversion of any then outstanding warrants,
Options, or other obligations or securities convertible or exchangeable into
shares of Company Common Stock or otherwise (regardless of whether (or to what
extent) such warrants, Options or other obligations or securities are then
vested, convertible, exchangeable, exercisable or "in-the-money"), but
excluding the Top-Up Option) (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

 

(ii) any waiting period (and extension thereof) under the HSR Act or under any
other antitrust or competition Laws applicable to the purchase of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer shall not have expired or been
terminated or any other clearance, consent, approval, order or authorization
required by applicable antitrust or competition Laws shall not have
been obtained (the " _Antitrust Condition_ ");

(iii) any of the following conditions shall exist at the time of expiration
of the Offer or immediately prior to such payment:

(A) any Judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a
Governmental Authority, or any Law shall be in effect (other than a Law that
imposes a waiting period to the extent of such waiting period) that would (1)
make the Offer or the Merger illegal, (2) otherwise prevent the consummation
thereof or (3) impose any material limitations on the ownership by Parent of
the Surviving Corporation or the operation by Parent of the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis;

 

(B) any suit, action or proceeding shall have been commenced and be pending by
any United States Federal or state or foreign Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction wherein a Judgment would have any of the effects
referred to in paragraph (A) above;

 



A-1  (C) since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall have occurred
any event, change, effect or development that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect;

(D) (1) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in _Section
3.2_, _Section 3.3(a)_ or _Section 3.3(b)_ of the Merger Agreement shall not
be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of the Merger
Agreement and as of such time, except to the extent such representation and
warranty expressly relates to an earlier time (in which case on and as of such
earlier time) or (2) any other representation and warranty of the Company set
forth in the Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct as of the date of
the Merger Agreement and as of such time, except to the extent such
representation and warranty expressly relates to an earlier time (in which
case on and as of such earlier time), other than in the case of clause (2) for
such failures to be true and correct that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect (it being understood that for this purpose all references to
the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" and other qualifications based on
the word "material," except for the reference to the term "Company Material
Adverse Effect" in _Section 3.6_ shall be disregarded);

(E) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or covenant
of the Company to be performed or complied with by it under the Merger
Agreement prior to such time;

 

(F) the Company fails to deliver to Parent a certificate signed by a senior
executive officer of the Company dated the date on which the Offer expires
certifying that the conditions specified in clauses (D) and (E) of this
paragraph (iii) do not exist;

which condition described in clauses (A) through (F), in the sole and
reasonable judgment of Merger Sub or Parent, in any such case, makes it
inadvisable to proceed with such acceptance for payment or payment; or

(iv) at or any time prior to the expiration of the Offer the Merger Agreement
shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub (except for the Minimum Tender
Condition) in whole or in part at any time and from time to time and in the
sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub, subject in each case to the terms of
the Merger Agreement and applicable Law. Any reference in this Annex I or in
the Merger Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be
deemed met if such condition or requirement is so waived. The foregoing
conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights of
Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. The failure by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the
waiver of any such right

 



A-2   with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a
waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.

Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit A_ but not defined herein shall
have the meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is attached, except
that the term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement
to which this _Exhibit A_ is attached.

(3) In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute

the corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the General
Corporation Law of Delaware, of this certificate, and to any by-laws from

ARTICLE SEVEN

Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this corporation and
its creditors or any class of them and/or between this corporation and its
stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within

corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of
any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under the provisions
of Section 291 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or on the
application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers
appointed for this corporation under the provisions of Section 279 of the
General Corporation Law of Delaware order a meeting of the creditors or class
of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this
corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said
court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of
the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of
stockholders of this corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise
or arrangement and to any reorganization of this corporation as a consequence
of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and said
reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which said application has
been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on
all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of this corporation, as the
case may be, and also on this corporation.

ARTICLE EIGHT

The corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or
hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders
herein are granted subject to this reservation.

 

ARTICLE NINE

The corporation shall:

(1) indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law
of Delaware, any director and any officer, employee or agent of the
corporation selected

 



B-2   by the board of directors for indemnification, such selection to be
evidenced by an indemnification agreement, who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the
fact that such person is or was a director, or is or was serving at
the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or
if such person has previously been designated for indemnification by a
resolution of the board of directors, an officer, employee or agent of the
corporation, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in
good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such
persons conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that
the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that such persons conduct was unlawful; and

(2) indemnify any director and any officer, employee or agent of the
corporation selected by the board of directors for indemnification, such
selection to be evidenced by an indemnification agreement, who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or if such person has previously
been designated for indemnification by a resolution of the board of directors,
an officer, employee or agent of the corporation, against expenses
(including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such
person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that
no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as
to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation
unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in
which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that,
despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of
the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper;
and

(4) indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent against expenses
(including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in
connection therewith, to the extent that such director, officer, employee or
agent of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in
defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in sections (1) and (2)
of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein; and

 



B-3  (5) make any indemnification under sections (1) and (2) of this Article
(unless ordered by a court) only as authorized in the specific case upon a
determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent
is proper in the circumstances because such director, officer, employee or
agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in sections (1)
and (2) of this Article. Such determination shall be made (1) by the board of
directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not
parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not
obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so
directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the
stockholders of the corporation; and

 

(6) pay expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending a civil or
criminal action, suit or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of
such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified
by the corporation as authorized in this Article. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the corporation shall not be obligated to pay expenses incurred by
a director or officer with respect to any threatened, pending, or completed
claim, suit or action, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative
or otherwise ("Proceedings") initiated or brought voluntarily by a director or
officer and not by way of defense (other than Proceedings brought to establish
or enforce a right to indemnification under the provisions of this Article
unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material
assertions made by the director or officer in such proceeding were not made in
good faith or were frivolous). The corporation shall not be obligated to
indemnify the director or officer for any amount paid in settlement of a
Proceeding covered hereby without the prior written consent of the corporation
to such settlement; and

 

(7) not deem the indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this Article as exclusive of
any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such directors
or officers official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office; and

(8) have the right, authority and power to purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted
against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or
arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the
provisions of this Article; and

 



B-4  (9) deem the provisions of this Article to be a contract between the
corporation and each director, or appropriately designated officer, employee
or agent who serves in such capacity at any time while this Article is in
effect and any repeal or modification of this Article shall not affect any
rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts then
or theretofore existing or any action, suit or proceeding theretofore or
thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon such state of
facts. The provisions of this Article shall not be deemed to be a contract
between the corporation and any directors, officers, employees or agents of
any other corporation (the "Second Corporation") which shall merge into or
consolidate with this corporation when this corporation shall be
the surviving or resulting corporation, and any such directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Second Corporation shall be indemnified to the
extent required under the General Corporation Law of Delaware only at the
discretion of the board of directors of this corporation; and

(10) continue the indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this Article, unless otherwise provided when authorized
or ratified, as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee
or agent of the corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such a person.

ARTICLE TEN

No director of the corporation shall be personally liable to the corporation
or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors duty of
loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not
in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware,
as the same exists or hereafter may be amended, or (iv) for any transaction
from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the General
Corporation Law of Delaware is amended to authorize the further elimination
or limitation of liability of directors, then the liability of a director of
the corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided
herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by the amended
General Corporation Law of Delaware. Any repeal or modification of this
Article by the stockholders of the corporation shall be prospective only, and
shall not adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a
director of the corporation existing at the time of such repeal or
modification.
