breach of the director&#146;s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii)&nbsp;for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii)&nbsp;under Section&nbsp;174 of the
General Corporation Law of Delaware, as the same exists or hereafter may be amended, or (iv)&nbsp;for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the General Corporation Law of Delaware is amended to authorize
the further elimination or limitation of liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by the
amended General Corporation Law of Delaware. Any repeal or modification of this Article by the stockholders of the corporation shall be prospective only, and shall not adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the
