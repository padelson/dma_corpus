AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of May 20, 2007,
among OLIN  CORPORATION, a Virginia corporation ("Parent"), PRINCETON MERGER
CORP., a  Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
("Sub"), and  PIONEER COMPANIES, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

 

 

WHEREAS  the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub has approved
and declared  advisable, and the Board of Directors of Parent has approved,
this Agreement  and  the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the
"Merger"), upon the terms and  subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, whereby each issued  and  outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company  ("Company Common Stock"), other than
(i) shares of Company Common Stock  directly owned by Parent, Sub or the
Company and (ii) the Appraisal Shares,  will be converted into the right to
receive $35.00 in cash; and

 

 

WHEREAS  Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties,  covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also
to prescribe  various conditions to the Merger.

 

 

NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants  and  agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the
conditions set  forth  herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

 

ARTICLE  I

 

 

The  Merger

 

 

SECTION  1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and  subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance  with  the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be  merged
with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the  Effective
Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the  Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and  obligations
of Sub in accordance with the DGCL.

 

 

SECTION  1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger  (the "Closing") will
take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by  the parties, which
shall be no later than the second business day after  satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by law) waiver of the conditions  set  forth in Article VI
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to  be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent  permitted by law)
waiver of those conditions), at the offices of Cravath,  Swaine and Moore LLP,
Worldwide Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue,  New York, New York 10019, unless another
time, date or place is agreed to  in writing by Parent and the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if  all the conditions set forth in Article VI
shall no longer be satisfied or  (to the extent permitted by law) waived on
such second business day, then  the  Closing shall take place on the first
business day on which all such conditions  shall have been satisfied or (to
the extent permitted by law)  waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this  Agreement as the "Closing Date".

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  1.03. _Effective Time._ Subject to the  provisions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date,  the  parties shall
file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a  certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") executed and acknowledged by  the
parties in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and, as 
soon  as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other
filings  or  recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective  upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State  of the  State of Delaware, or at such later time as Parent and the
Company shall  agree  and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the
time the Merger becomes  effective being the "Effective Time").

 

 

SECTION  1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger  shall have the effects
set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

 

 

SECTION  1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and  Bylaws._ (a) The Fourth
Amended and Restated  Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the
"Company Certificate")  shall be amended at the Effective Time as set forth
in Exhibit A and, as so  amended, such Company Certificate shall be the
Amended and Restated Certificate  of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or  amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.

 

 

(b) The  Bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall  be  the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed
or amended  as  provided therein or by applicable law.

 

 

SECTION  1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub  immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving  Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their  respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may  be.

 

 

SECTION  1.07. _Officers._ The officers of Sub  immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving  Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their  respective successors

ARTICLE  II 

 

 

Effect  of  the Merger on the Capital Stock of the

 

Constituent  Corporations; Exchange of Certificates

 

 

SECTION  2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the  Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part  of  the holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital  stock  of Parent or
Sub:

 

 

(a) _Capital  Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock  of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid  and  nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

(b) _Cancellation  of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share of
Company  Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, Parent or Sub
immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
retired and  shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange  therefor.

 

 

(c) _Conversion  of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common
Stock  (including Company Restricted Shares) issued and outstanding
immediately  prior  to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled
in accordance with  Section 2.01(b) and the Appraisal Shares) shall be
converted into the right  to receive $35.00 in cash, without interest (the
"Merger  Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company 
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled  and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which
immediately  prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common  Stock  (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto,  except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. As provided in  Section 2.02(h), the right of any holder of a
Certificate to receive the  Merger Consideration shall be subject to and
reduced by the amount of any  withholding that is required under applicable
tax law.

 

 

(d) _Appraisal  Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the 
contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued and 
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any 
holder  who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal  Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions  of  Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be
converted into  the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in  Section 2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment
of  the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the
provisions  of  Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares
shall  no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease  to  exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have
any rights  with  respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair
value of such Appraisal  Shares in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder  shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right  to  appraisal
under Section 262, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall  determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by  Section 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of  such holder's Appraisal
Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such  Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective  Time  into, and to have
become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as  provided in Section
2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt  notice to Parent of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of  any  shares of Company Common
Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate  in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such  demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without  the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect  to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of  the  foregoing.

SECTION  2.02. _Exchange of  Certificates._ (a) _Paying  Agent._ Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint American  Stock Transfer and Trust
Company or another comparable bank or trust company  reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent")  for the payment of
the Merger Consideration. At the earlier of the  Closing and the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving  Corporation to deposit,
with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders  of  Certificates,
cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger  Consideration
required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (such cash  being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

 

 

(b) _Exchange  Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective  Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record  of a  Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that  delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates  shall  pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent and  which shall be in customary form and have such other
provisions as Parent  may  reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the  surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger 
Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon  surrender
to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter  of 
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be 
required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor 
the  amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously  represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into
the right  to  receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so
surrendered  shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership  of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of  the  Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to
a person other  than  the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if  such  Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for  transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or  other  taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a  person  other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the  reasonable satisfaction of
Parent that such taxes have been paid or are not  applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this  Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the  Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive upon such surrender  the  Merger Consideration which the holder
thereof has the right to receive in  respect of such Certificate pursuant to
this Article II. No  interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable to holders of  Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II.

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(c) _No  Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid 
upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this 
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all 
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented 
by  such Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which the 
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed,  and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer  books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock  that  were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after  the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation  for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to
the holder  thereof as provided in this Article II.

 

 

(d) _Termination  of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which  remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for nine
months  after  the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any holders  of  the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II  shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall
remain liable  for,  payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration.

 

 

(e) _No  Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving 
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect  of
any  cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant  to  any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If
any  Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to three years after
the  Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
Merger  Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any  Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the
extent  permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear  of  all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

 

(f) _Investment  of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the  Exchange Fund in a money market fund registered under the Investment
Company  Act  of 1940, the principal of which is invested solely in
obligations issued  or  guaranteed by the United States government and
repurchase agreements in respect  of such obligations. Any interest and other
income resulting from  such investments shall be paid to Parent. If for any
reason  (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to  fully  satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by the Exchange  Agent  hereunder (but subject to Sections 2.02(d) and
2.02(e)), Parent shall promptly  deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an
amount which is equal to the  deficiency in the amount of cash required to
fully satisfy such cash payment  obligations.

(g) _Lost  Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or  destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming  such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by Parent,  the  posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount
as Parent may  direct  as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to  such  Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen  or  destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect  thereto.

 

 

(h) _Withholding  Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent  shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise  payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common  Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent  is  required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment  under  the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), or any provision of  state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so  withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Parent, the  Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be  treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder  of  the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and  withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying  Agent.

 

 

ARTICLE  III 

 

 

Representations  and Warranties

 

 

SECTION  3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the  Company._ Except as
set forth in the disclosure schedule (with  specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection of this Agreement  to  which the
information set forth in such disclosure schedule relates;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any information set forth in one section  of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other  Section or
subsection thereof or hereof to which its relevance is readily  apparent on
its face) delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution  of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company represents  and
warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:

 

 

(a) _Organization,  Standing and Corporate Power._ Each of the Company and
its  Subsidiaries has been duly organized, and is validly existing and,
where  such  concept is applicable, in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction  of  its incorporation or formation, as the case may be, and
has all requisite  power  and authority and possesses all governmental
licenses, permits, authorizations  and approvals necessary to enable it to
use its corporate or other name and  to  own, lease or otherwise hold and
operate its properties and other assets  and to  carry on its business as
presently conducted and as currently proposed to  be  conducted, except
where the failure to have such governmental licenses, permits, 
authorizations or approvals individually or in the aggregate has not had 
and  would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse  Effect.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or  licensed to do
business and, where such concept is applicable, is in good  standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the  ownership, leasing
or operation of its properties makes such qualification  or  licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to  be so 
qualified or licensed individually or in the aggregate has not had and would 
not  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company 
has made available to Parent, prior to the execution of this Agreement,
complete  and accurate copies of the Company Certificate and its Amended and
Restated  Bylaws (the "Company Bylaws"), and the comparable organizational
documents of  each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date 
hereof. The Company has made available to Parent complete and  accurate
copies of the minutes (or, in the case of minutes that have not  yet  been
finalized, drafts thereof) of all meetings of the stockholders of the 
Company and each of its Subsidiaries, the Boards of Directors of the Company

(b) _Subsidiaries._ Section 3.01(b)  of the Company Disclosure Schedule
lists, as of the date hereof, each of  the  Subsidiaries of the Company and,
for each such Subsidiary, the jurisdiction  of  incorporation or formation
and, each jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary  is  qualified or licensed
to do business. All the issued and outstanding  shares of Capital Stock of
each such Subsidiary have been validly issued  and are  fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the  Company  free and
clear of all pledges, liens, charges, encumbrances or security  interests of
any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"), and free of  any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such Capital 
Stock. Except for the Capital Stock of its Subsidiaries, the Company  does
not own, directly or indirectly, any Capital Stock of any corporation, 
partnership, joint venture, association, limited liability company, trust, 
unincorporated organization or other entity.

 

 

(c) _Capital  Structure._ (i) The authorized Capital Stock of the  Company
consists of 50,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and  10,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per  share ("Company Preferred Stock").
At the close of business on  May 18, 2007, (A) 11,840,934 shares of Company
Common Stock were  issued and outstanding (including 37,755 Company
Restricted Shares),  (B) no shares of Company Common Stock were held by the
Company in its  treasury, (C) 1,257,955 shares of Company Common Stock were
reserved  and available for issuance pursuant to the Company 2006 Stock
Incentive Plan  and  the Company 2001 Employee Stock Option Plan
(collectively, the "Company Stock  Plans"), of which 178,039 shares of
Company Common Stock were subject to  outstanding Company Stock Options, (D)
no shares of Company Preferred Stock  were issued or outstanding or were held
by the Company as treasury shares  and  (E) up to 3,398,664 shares of
Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance  and issuable upon conversion
of the Company's 2.75% Convertible Senior  Subordinated Notes due 2027 (the
"Convertible Notes"). Except as set  forth above in this Section 3.01(c)(i),
at the close of business on May 18,  2007, no shares of Capital Stock of the
Company were issued, reserved for  issuance or outstanding. There are no
outstanding shares of Company  Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
subject to vesting or restrictions  on  transfer, stock appreciation rights,
"phantom" stock rights, performance units,  rights to receive shares of
Company Common Stock on a deferred basis or other  rights (other than Company
Stock Options, the Company Restricted Shares and  the  Convertible Notes)

Stock-Based Awards").

(ii) Section 3.01(c)(ii)  of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and accurate list,  as  of May 18, 2007, of (A) all outstanding
options to purchase shares of  Company Common Stock (collectively, "Company
Stock Options") under the Company  Stock Plans or otherwise, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject  thereto, the grant dates, expiration
dates, exercise or base prices (if  applicable) and vesting schedules thereof
and the names of the holders thereof  and (B) all shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding but were  subject to vesting or other forfeiture
restrictions or were subject to a  right  of repurchase by the Company at a
fixed purchase price (shares so subject,  the "Company Restricted Shares")
under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise, the  grant and issuance dates,
expiration dates, vesting schedules and repurchase  price (if any) thereof
and the names of the holders thereof. All  (1) Company Restricted Shares and
(2) Company Stock Options are  evidenced by stock option agreements,
restricted stock purchase agreements  or  other award agreements, in each
case in the forms set forth in  Section 3.01(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and no stock option  agreement, restricted stock purchase agreement
or other award agreement contains  terms that are inconsistent with or in
addition to such forms. Each  grant of a Company Stock Option was duly
authorized no later than the date  on  which the grant of such Company Stock
Option was by its terms to be effective  (the "Grant Date") by all necessary
corporate action, including, as applicable,  approval by the Board of
Directors of the Company (or a duly constituted  and  authorized committee
thereof) and any required stockholder approval by the  necessary number of
votes or written consents, and the award agreement governing  such grant (if
any) was duly executed and delivered by each party thereto,  each  such
grant was made in accordance with the terms of the applicable compensation 
plan or arrangement of the Company, the Exchange Act and all other
applicable  laws and regulatory rules or requirements, including the rules of
the Nasdaq  Global Market, the per share exercise price of each Company Stock
Option  was  equal to the fair market value of a share of Company Common
Stock on the  applicable Grant Date and each such grant was properly
accounted for in  accordance with GAAP in the financial statements (including
the related notes)  of the Company and disclosed in the Company SEC Documents
in accordance with  the  Exchange Act and all other applicable laws. The
Company has not  knowingly granted, and there is no and has been no Company
policy or practice  to  grant, Company Stock Options prior to, or otherwise
coordinate the grant  of  Company Stock Options with, the release or other
public announcement of material  information regarding the Company or its
Subsidiaries or their financial  results  or prospects. Each Company Stock
Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422
of the Code so  qualifies. Each Company Stock Option and each Company
Restricted  Share may, by its terms, be treated at the Effective Time as set
forth in  Section 5.04(a)(i) or 5.04(a)(ii), as applicable. All  outstanding
shares of Capital Stock of the Company are, and all shares which  may  be
issued pursuant to the Company Stock Options and the Convertible Notes 
will  be, when issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized,
validly  issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive 
rights.

 

 

(iii) Except  for the Convertible Notes, there are no bonds, debentures,
notes or other  indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or
convertible into,  or  exchangeable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matters on  which  stockholders of the Company may vote. Except
as set forth above in  this Section 3.01(c), (A) there are not issued,
reserved for issuance  or outstanding (1) any shares of Capital Stock of the
Company, (2) any  securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
convertible into or  exchangeable or exercisable for Capital Stock of the
Company or any Subsidiary  of the Company or (3) any warrants, calls, options
or other rights to  acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
no obligation of  the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any
Capital Stock or securities  convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for Capital Stock of the  Company  or any Subsidiary of the Company and (B)
there are not any outstanding  obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem  or  otherwise acquire any such
securities or to issue, deliver or sell, or cause  to  be issued, delivered
or sold, any such securities. Neither the Company nor  any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any voting agreement with respect to  the  voting
of any such securities.

power  and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate
the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject, in the case of

of this  Agreement be submitted as promptly as practicable to a vote at a
meeting  of the  stockholders of the Company and (iv) recommending that the
stockholders of  the Company adopt this Agreement, which resolutions, as of

or withdrawn in  any  way. The execution and delivery of this Agreement do
not, and the  consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement will not,  conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of,
or default (with  or  without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
give rise to a right  of, or  result in, termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or  to the  loss of a benefit under, or
result in the creation of any Lien in or upon  any of  the properties or
other assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  under,  (x) the

the  case of clauses (y) and (z), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, 
defaults, rights, losses or Liens that individually or in the aggregate have 
not  had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 
Effect. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by or  in
respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Federal, 
state,  local or foreign government, any court, administrative, regulatory or
other  governmental agency, commission or authority or any non-governmental

Subsidiaries  in  connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company  or  the consummation of the Merger or the other

other  information incorporated therein) with the SEC required to be filed by
the  Company since January 1, 2004 (such documents, together with any

to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under  which 
they were made, not misleading. Except to the extent that information 
contained in any Company SEC Document has been revised, amended,
supplemented  or  superseded by a later-filed Company SEC Document, none of
the Company SEC  Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact
or omits to state  any  material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make  the  statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made,  not misleading which individually
or in the aggregate would require an  amendment, supplement or corrective
filing to any such Company SEC  Document. Each of the financial statements
(including the related  notes) of the Company included in the Company SEC
Documents complied at the  time  it was filed as to form in all material
respects with the applicable accounting  requirements and the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect  thereto in effect at the time of

principles in the United States ("GAAP") (except,  in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by the rules and regulations  of the SEC) applied on

in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material  respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated 
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their 
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case 
of  unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). Except  as
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed by the Company and publicly 
available prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Filed Company SEC 
Documents"), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities  or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or  otherwise) which individually or in the aggregate have had or
would reasonably  be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. None of
the  Subsidiaries of the Company are, or have at any time since January 1,
2002,  been  subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and
15(d) of  the Exchange Act.

required by Rule 13a-14  or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302
and 906 of SOX  with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements
contained in  such  certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of
this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the  meanings given to such terms in SOX. Neither the

sufficient  to  provide reasonable assurance (A) regarding the reliability
of the Company's  financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external  purposes in accordance with GAAP, (B) that
transactions are recorded as  necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with  GAAP,  (C) that receipts and expenditures of
the Company are being made only in  accordance with the authorization of
management and directors of the Company  and  (D) regarding prevention or
timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition,  use or disposition of the

financial statements.

 

 

(iv) The  "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and  15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) of the Company are designed to ensure
that  all  information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by  the  Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is  recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified  in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information required  to be  disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the  Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
the Company's management as  appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to  enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of the Company  to  make the certifications required under
the Exchange Act with respect to such  reports.

any of its  Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including  any  structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose
entity or person,  on the  other hand, or any "off balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in  Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act)), where the  result, purpose or intended effect of such
Contract is to avoid disclosure  of  any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company  or  any of its Subsidiaries in the
Company's or such Subsidiary's published  financial statements or other
Company SEC Documents.

 

 

(vi) Since  January 1, 2004, the Company has not received any oral or
written  notification of any "material weakness" in the Company's internal
controls over  financial reporting. There is no outstanding "significant
deficiency" or "material weakness" which the Company's independent
accountants certify has  not been appropriately and adequately remedied by
the Company. For  purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant
deficiency" and "material  weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them
in Release 2004-001 of  the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in
effect on the date  hereof.

supplied by  or on behalf of the Company specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by  reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first mailed to  the  stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Stockholders' Meeting,  contain any untrue statement of a material fact or

in order to make the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not  misleading, except that no representation or
warranty is made by the Company  with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based  on  information supplied by or on
behalf of Parent or Sub in writing specifically  for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy  Statement. The Proxy Statement will

properties or other assets is bound, except  for violations or defaults that
individually or in the aggregate have not  had  and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

(iii) The  Restricted Contracts represent at least 80% of the aggregate
volume purchased  or  sold, as the case may be, by the Company and its
Subsidiaries of each product  or  service they purchased or sold.

 

 

(j) _Compliance  with Laws; Environmental Matters._ (i) Except with  respect
to Environmental Laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act  of 
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and taxes, which are the subjects of  Sections
3.01(j)(ii), 3.01(l) and 3.01(n), respectively, each of the  Company and its
Subsidiaries is in compliance with all statutes, laws,  ordinances, rules,
regulations, judgments, orders and decrees of any  Governmental Entity
applicable to it, its properties or other assets or its  business or
operations (collectively, "Legal Provisions"), except for failures  to be in
compliance that individually or in the aggregate have not had and  would 
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of  the
Company and its Subsidiaries has in effect all approvals, authorizations, 
certificates, filings, franchises, licenses, notices and permits of or with 
all  Governmental Entities (collectively, "Permits"), necessary for it to
own, lease  or operate its properties and other assets and to carry on its
business and  operations as presently conducted and as currently proposed to
be conducted,  except where the failure to have such Permits individually or
in the aggregate  has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse  Effect. There has occurred no default under, or violation
of, any  such Permit, except for any such default or violation that
individually or  in  the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a  Material Adverse Effect. The consummation of the Merger,
in and of  itself, would not cause the revocation or cancellation of any such
Permit  that  individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected
to have a Material  Adverse Effect. No action, demand, requirement or
investigation by  any Governmental Entity and no suit, action or proceeding
by any other person,  in each case with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any  of  their respective properties or other assets under
any Legal Provision, is  pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, except for actions,  demands, requirements, investigations, suits
or proceedings that individually  or  in the aggregate would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse  Effect.

There are no collective bargaining or other labor  union agreements to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party  or  by which the Company

(l) _Employee  Benefit Matters_. (i) Section 3.01(l)(i) of the  Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of each  Company
Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in 
Section 3(2) of ERISA) (sometimes referred to herein as a "Company Pension 
Plan"), each Company Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan"
(as  defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other Company Benefit Plans
and  Company Benefit Agreements in effect on the date of this  Agreement.
The Company has provided to Parent complete and accurate  copies of (A) each
Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement (or,  in the case of any
unwritten Company Benefit Plans or Company Benefit  Agreements, written
descriptions thereof), (B) the two most recent annual  reports on Form 5500
(including any accompanying schedules and attachments)  required to be filed
with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") and the two  most recent annual
information returns filed with any Governmental Entity  with  respect to
each Company Benefit Plan (if any such report was required under  applicable
law), (C) the most recent summary plan description and summary  of material
modifications (including any applicable notices under  Section 204(h) of
ERISA) for each Company Benefit Plan for which a summary  plan description or
summary of material modifications, as applicable, is  required under
applicable law, (D) the two most recent actuarial valuations  for each
Company Benefit Plan (if any) and (E) each trust agreement and  insurance or
group annuity contract relating to any Company Benefit  Plan. Each Company
Benefit Plan has been administered in all material  respects in accordance
with its terms. Each Company Benefit Plan has  been administered in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable  provisions of ERISA,
the Code and all other applicable laws, including laws  of  foreign
jurisdictions, and the terms of all collective bargaining  agreements.

 

 

(ii) All  Company Pension Plans intended to be tax-qualified have received
favorable  determination letters from the IRS with respect to all tax law
changes with  respect to which the IRS is currently willing to provide a
determination  letter,  to the effect that such Company Pension Plans are
qualified and exempt from  Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the  Code, no such determination letter has been
revoked (nor, to the Knowledge  of  the Company, has revocation been
threatened) and no event has occurred since  the  date of the most recent
determination letter or application therefor relating  to  any such Company
Pension Plan that would reasonably be expected to adversely  affect the
qualification of such Company Pension Plan or materially increase  the 
costs relating thereto or require security under Section 307 of  ERISA. All
Company Pension Plans required to have been approved by or  registered with
any foreign Governmental Entity have been so approved or  registered, no such
approval or registration has been revoked (nor, to the  Knowledge of the
Company, has revocation been threatened) and no event has  occurred since the
date of the most recent approval or application therefor  relating to any
such Company Pension Plan that would reasonably be expected  to  materially
affect any such approval or registration relating thereto or  materially
increase the costs relating thereto. The Company has  delivered to Parent a
complete and accurate copy of the most recent  determination letter received
prior to the date hereof with respect to each  Company Pension Plan, as well
as a complete and accurate copy of each pending  application for a
determination letter, if any. The Company has also  provided to Parent a
complete and accurate list of all amendments to any  Company  Pension Plan
as to which a favorable determination letter has not yet been  received.

(iii) Section  3.01(l)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
list of (A) each  Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA that the
Company, any Commonly  Controlled Entity or any predecessor thereof sponsors,
maintains or contributes  to, or has in the past sponsored, maintained or
contributed to (each, a "Title  IV Plan"), and (B) each other Company Benefit
Plan that is a defined benefit  pension plan. All contributions, premiums and
benefit payments under  or in connection with the Company Benefit Plans that
are required to have  been  made in accordance with the terms of such
Company Benefit Plan and all  applicable laws have been timely made. No
"accumulated funding  deficiency", as defined in Section 412(a) of the Code,
has been incurred with  respect to any Title IV Plan, whether or not waived.
No event  described in Sections 4062 or 4063 of ERISA, has occurred in
connection with  any  Company Benefit Plan. No Title IV Plan, other than any
Title IV Plan  that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA  (a "Multiemployer Plan"), had, as of the last annual
valuation date for such  Title IV Plan, any "unfunded benefit liabilities"
(as such term is defined in  Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA) based on actuarial
assumptions that have been  delivered to Parent, and there has been no
material adverse change in the  financial condition of any Title IV Plan
since its last such annual valuation  date. Neither the Company nor any
Commonly Controlled Entity has (1)  engaged in, or is a successor or parent
corporation to an entity that has  engaged in, a transaction described in
Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA or  (2)  incurred, or reasonably expects to
incur prior to the Closing Date, any  liability under Title IV or Section 302
of ERISA, other than liability for  premiums due to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (which premiums  have  been paid when due).

 

 

(iv) Neither  the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has announced an
intention  to  withdraw, but has not yet completed withdrawal, from a
Multiemployer Plan,  and  no action has been taken, and no circumstance
exists, that has resulted or  would, with the passage of time, reasonably be
expected to result in any  liability under Title IV of ERISA by the Company
or any Commonly Controlled  Entity for any withdrawal from a Multiemployer
Plan. Section  3.01(l)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a list
of Multiemployer  Plans that the Company or any Commonly Controlled Entity or
any predecessor  thereof contributes to, or has in the past contributed to,
and lists for  each  Multiemployer Plan the Company's reasonable, good faith
estimate of the maximum  amount of withdrawal liability that would be
incurred if the Company and  each  Commonly Controlled Entity were to make a
complete withdrawal from such plan  as  of the Closing Date, and the amount
of "unfunded vested benefits" (within the  meaning of Section 4211 of ERISA)
as of the end of the most recently completed  plan year and as of the date of
this Agreement.

(v) All  reports, returns and similar documents with respect to all Company
Benefit  Plans  required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or
distributed to any Company  Benefit Plan participant have been duly and
timely filed or  distributed. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has  received notice of, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no 
investigations by any Governmental Entity with respect to, termination 
proceedings or other claims (except claims for benefits payable in the
normal  operation of the Company Benefit Plans), suits or proceedings against
or  involving any Company Benefit Plan or asserting any rights or claims to
benefits  under any Company Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
give  rise to  any material liability, and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
there are not  any  facts that could give rise to any material liability in
the event of any  such  investigation, claim, suit or proceeding.

 

 

(vi) There  are no understandings, agreements or undertakings, written or
oral, with  any  person (other than pursuant to the express terms of the
applicable Company  Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement) that are
(pursuant to any such  understandings, agreements or undertakings) reasonably
expected to result  in any  liabilities if such Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Agreement were  amended or terminated on or at any time after
the Effective Time or that  would  prevent any unilateral action by the
Company (or, after the Effective Time,  Parent) to effect such amendment or
termination. No Company Benefit  Plan or related trust has been terminated
during the last five years, nor  has  there been any "reportable event" (as
that term is defined in Section 4043 of  ERISA) for which the 30-day
reporting requirement has not been waived with  respect to any Company
Benefit Plan during the last five years, and no notice  of  a reportable
event will be required to be filed in connection with the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No "wind-up" (as that  term is defined in
Section 1(1) of the _Pension Benefits Act_ (New  Brunswick or similar
applicable law) or other legislation under which a Company  Benefit Plan has
been registered) in whole or in part of any Company Benefit  Plan has been
previously ordered nor has any event occurred which would cause  any
Governmental Entity to order a wind-up, in whole or in part, of any Company 
Benefit Plan offered to Canadian employees of the Company.

 

 

(vii) With  respect to each Company Benefit Plan, (A) there has not occurred
any prohibited  transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or 
Section 4975 of the Code or similar applicable law) in which the Company, 
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors or 
employees, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator 
or  other fiduciary of such Company Benefit Plan, or any agent of the
foregoing,  has  engaged that would reasonably be expected to subject the
Company, any of  its  Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors or employees,  or, to  the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee,
administrator or other fiduciary  of  any trust created under any Company
Benefit Plan, to the tax or penalty on  prohibited transactions imposed by
Section 4975 of the Code or the  sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA or
any other applicable law and  (B) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge  of the Company, any trustee,
administrator or other fiduciary of any Company  Benefit Plan nor any agent
of any of the foregoing, has engaged in any  transaction or acted in a
manner, or failed to act in a manner, that would  reasonably be expected to
subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  or, to  the Knowledge of the
Company, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary,  to  any liability
for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other applicable  law.

(viii) Section 3.01(l)(viii)  of the Company Disclosure Schedule discloses
whether each Company Benefit  Plan  and each Company Benefit Agreement that
is an employee welfare benefit plan  is  (A) unfunded or self-insured, (B)
funded through a "welfare benefit  fund", as such term is defined in Section
419(e) of the Code, or other  funding mechanism, or (C) insured. Each such
employee welfare  benefit plan may be amended or terminated (including with
respect to benefits  provided to retirees and other former employees) without
material liability  to  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time
after the Effective  Time. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries complies
in all  material respects with the applicable requirements of Section
4980B(f) of  the Code, Sections 601-609 of ERISA or any similar state or
local law with  respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is a group health
plan, as such  term  is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code or such
state or local  law. No Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement
that is an  employee welfare benefit plan provides benefits after termination
of employment,  except where the cost thereof is borne entirely by the former
employee (or  his  or her eligible dependents or beneficiaries) or as
required by Section 4980B(f)  of the Code.

 

 

(ix) None  of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of
the  Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction  expressly contemplated by this Agreement (including as a result
of any  termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) will 
(A) entitle any Participant to severance, termination, retention, change in 
control or similar compensation or benefits, (B) accelerate the time of 
payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor 
trust  or otherwise) of, compensation or benefits under, increase the amount
payable  or  trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, or increase
the cost of,  any  Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or
otherwise or  (C) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under,
any Company  Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement. The total amount of
all  payments and the fair market value of all non-cash benefits (other than
Company  Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares) that may become payable
or provided  to any Participant under the Company Benefit Plans and Company
Benefit  Agreements (assuming for such purpose that such individual's
employment were  terminated immediately following the Effective Time as if
the Effective Time  were the date hereof) will not exceed the aggregate
amount set forth in  Section 3.01(l)(ix) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(x) Neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liability or  obligations, including under or on account of a Company Benefit
Plan, arising  out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the
Company or any of  its  Subsidiaries and incorrectly classifying such
persons as consultants or  independent contractors and not as employees of
the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries.

 

 

(xi) No  deduction by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of
any "applicable employee remuneration" (within the meaning of Section 162(m)
of  the Code) has been disallowed or is subject to disallowance by reason
of  Section 162(m) of the Code, and no Participant has received or is 
reasonably expected to receive any payment or benefit from the Company or 
any of  its Subsidiaries that would be nondeductible pursuant to Section
162(m) of  the Code.

 

 

(xii) Each  Company Benefit Plan and each Company Benefit Agreement that is a
"nonqualified  deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code  (a "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan") subject
to Section 409A of the  Code has been operated in compliance with Section
409A of the Code since  January  1, 2005, based upon a good faith,
reasonable interpretation of (A) Section  409A  of the Code and (B) the
rules, regulations and other guidance promulgated  thereunder (clauses (A)
and (B), together, the "409A  Authorities"). No Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Agreement  that would be a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
Plan subject to Section  409A  of the Code but for the effective date
provisions that are applicable to  Section  409A of the Code, as set forth
in Section 885(d) of the American Jobs Creation  Act of 2004, as amended (the
"AJCA"), has been "materially modified" within the  meaning of Section
885(d)(2)(B) of the AJCA after October 3, 2004, based  upon a  good faith
reasonable interpretation of the AJCA and the 409A  Authorities. No
Participant is entitled to any gross-up, make-whole  or other additional
payment from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in  respect of any tax
(including Federal, state, local or foreign income, excise  or  other taxes
(including taxes imposed under Section 409A of the Code)) or  interest or
penalty related thereto.

(m) _No  Excess Parachute Payments._ Other than payments or benefits that 
may be made to the persons listed in Section 3.01(m) of the Company 
Disclosure Schedule ("Primary Company Executives"), no amount or other 
entitlement or economic benefit that could be received (whether in cash or 
property or the vesting of property) as a result of the execution and
delivery  of this Agreement, the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval, the
consummation  of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement (alone  or  in combination with any other event, including as a
result of termination  of  employment on or following the Effective Time)
(such actions, collectively,  "Merger Actions") by or for the benefit of any
director, officer, employee or  consultant of the Company or any of its
Affiliates who is a "disqualified  individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation  Section 1.280G-1) under any Company Benefit Plan,
Company Benefit Agreement  or otherwise would be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as such  term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code), and no disqualified  individual is entitled to receive any additional
payment from the Company,  any  of its Subsidiaries, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other person  in  the event that the excise tax required
by Section 4999(a) of the Code is  imposed on such disqualified individual (a
"Parachute Gross Up  Payment"). Section 3.01(m) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule  sets forth, calculated as of the date of this Agreement, (i) the
"base  amount" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code)
for  each Primary Company Executive and each other disqualified individual
(defined  as set forth above) who holds any Company Stock Options or Company
Restricted  Shares that will vest in connection with any Merger Action and
(ii) the  Company's reasonable, good faith estimate of the maximum amount
that could be  received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property, and including  the amount of any tax gross-up) by each Primary
Company Executive as a result  of  any Merger Action.

 

 

(n) _Taxes._ (i) Each  of the Company and its Subsidiaries has (A) duly filed
with the appropriate  taxing authorities all material tax returns required to
be filed by it for  all  periods ending on or prior to the Effective Time,
and (B) duly paid in full  or  made adequate provision in accordance with
GAAP for the payment of all material  taxes due, whether or not shown as due
in such tax returns.

 

 

(ii) (A)  No federal, state, local or foreign audits, examinations,
investigations  or  other administrative proceedings (collectively "Audits")
or court proceedings  are presently pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened with  regard to any taxes owed or claimed to be owed by
or on behalf of the Company  or  any of its Subsidiaries, and (B) amounts
finally agreed upon or determined,  as  the case may be, to be owed from any
Audit or court proceedings relating  to  taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have been paid.

 

 

(iii) None  of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be required to
include in  a  taxable period ending after the Effective Time taxable income
attributable  to  income that accrued (for purposes of the financial
statements of the Company  included in the Filed Company SEC Documents) in a
prior taxable period (or  portion of a taxable period) but was not recognized
for tax purposes in any  prior taxable period (or portion of a taxable
period) as a result of  (A) the installment method of accounting, (B) the

SECTION  4.02. _No  Solicitation._ (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it 
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective 
directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, financial
advisor,  attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative
(collectively,  "Representatives") retained by it or any of its Affiliates
to, directly or  indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly  encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which would
reasonably  be  expected to, facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter
into, continue  or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or  furnish to any person any information, or otherwise cooperate
in any way  with,  any Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is agreed  that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence  by  any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be a breach  of this Section 4.02(a) by the Company. The Company shall,
and  shall cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated  all existing discussions or negotiations with any person
conducted heretofore  with respect to any Takeover Proposal and request the
prompt return or  destruction of all confidential information previously 
furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to  obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Takeover  Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith  (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally 
recognized reputation) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead 
to a  Superior Proposal by such party, and which Takeover Proposal was not
solicited  after the date hereof and was made after the date hereof and did
not otherwise  result from a breach of this Section 4.02(a), the Company may,
if its Board  of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel)  that it is required to do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties  to the  stockholders of the Company under applicable law,
and subject to compliance  with  Section 4.02(c), (x) furnish information
with respect to the Company  and its Subsidiaries to the person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its  Representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (which  need  not restrict such person from making
an unsolicited Takeover Proposal) not  less  restrictive of such person than
the confidentiality provisions of the  Confidentiality Agreement; provided
that all such information has previously  been provided to Parent or is
provided to Parent prior to or substantially  concurrent with the time it is
provided to such person, and (y) participate  in discussions or negotiations
with the person making such Takeover Proposal  (and its Representatives)
regarding such Takeover Proposal.

 

 

The  term "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
person  relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
direct  or  indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series
of  transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 15% or more of
the  revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken  as  a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company  or any  of its Subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated  would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or
more of any class of  equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any merger,  consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution,  joint venture, binding share
exchange or similar transaction involving the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or the  stockholders of any person
would own 15% or more of any class of equity  securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or of any resulting  parent  company of the Company,
other than the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

The  term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide offer made by a third
party that if  consummated would result in such person (or its stockholders)
owning, directly  or indirectly, all or substantially all of the shares of
Company Common Stock  then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a
merger or the direct or  indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger)
or all or substantially  all  the assets of the Company, which the Board of
Directors of the Company  determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a  financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
to be (i) more  favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial
point of view  than  the Merger (taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal  and this Agreement (including any changes to the
terms of this Agreement  proposed by Parent in response to such offer or
otherwise)) and  (ii) reasonably capable of being completed, taking into
account all  financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

 

 

(b) Except  as set forth below, neither the Board of Directors of the Company
nor any  committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to  Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to  Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by such  Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of
this Agreement, the Merger  or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) recommend,  adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any  Takeover Proposal (any action described in
this clause (i) being referred  to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation
Change") or (ii) approve or  recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, or allow the Company  or  any of its Affiliates to execute or
enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum  of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition  agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement  or  other similar agreement
constituting or related to, or that is intended to  or  would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than  a  confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)) (an "Acquisition  Agreement").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to  obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company  may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors  of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside  counsel 
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that it is
required  to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders  of the  Company under applicable law; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that no Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made until  after the
fourth business day following Parent's receipt of written notice (a "Notice
of Adverse Recommendation") from the Company advising Parent that the  Board
of Directors of the Company intends to take such action and specifying  the 
reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any Superior
Proposal  that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors
(it being  understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or
any other  material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice
of Adverse  Recommendation and a new four business day period). In
determining  whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Board of Directors  of the Company shall take into account any changes to the
terms of this  Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of
Adverse Recommendation  or otherwise.

(c) In  addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs
(a) and  (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall promptly advise Parent 
orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and 
conditions of any such Takeover Proposal and the identity of the person
making  any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent  fully
informed of the status and details (including any change to the terms 
thereof) of any such Takeover Proposal and any discussions and negotiations 
concerning the material terms and conditions thereof and (ii) provide to 
Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies 
of  all correspondence and other written material relating to any such
Takeover  Proposal exchanged between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(or their  Representatives), on the one hand, and the person making such
Takeover Proposal  (or its Representatives), on the other hand.

 

 

(d) Nothing  contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (x)
taking and  disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) and  14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) making any
disclosure to  the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment
of the Board  of  Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside
counsel) failure  to so  disclose is reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its obligations under  applicable law, including the Board of Directors'
duty of candor to the  stockholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event  shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any
committee thereof take,  or  agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited
by  Section 4.02(b).

review and comment on such document or response and  (ii) shall include in

(b) The  Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement,  establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold  a  meeting of its stockholders (the "Stockholders' Meeting")
solely for the purpose  of obtaining the Stockholder Approval. Subject to 
Section 4.02(b) and 4.02(d), the Company shall, through its Board of 
Directors, recommend to its stockholders adoption of this Agreement and
shall  include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting 
the generality of the foregoing, the Company's obligations pursuant to the
first  sentence of this Section 5.01(b) shall not be affected by (i) the 
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the 
Company  of any Takeover Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by
the  Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof of such
Board  of  Directors' or such committee's approval or recommendation of this

to have occurred if the  Company adjourns or postpones the Stockholders'
Meeting for a reasonable period  of time, each such period of time not to
exceed 10 business days, if (x) at  the time of such adjournment or
postponement Parent shall have received a  Notice  of Adverse Recommendation
and the Stockholders' Meeting is scheduled to occur  within four business
days of the time of delivery of such Notice of Adverse  Recommendation to
Parent or (y) at the time the Board of Directors  announces a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Stockholders' Meeting is  then scheduled to occur
no later than 10 business days from the date of  such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change; provided further that the Company  may not adjourn or
postpone the Stockholders' Meeting pursuant to the preceding  proviso more
than two times or for more than 15 business days in the  aggregate.

 

 

SECTION  5.02. _Access to Information;  Confidentiality._ Insofar as
permitted by applicable law and the  terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Company shall afford to Parent,  and  to Parent's officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and  other Representatives,
reasonable access (including for the purpose of  coordinating integration
activities and transition planning with the employees  of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) during normal business hours and upon  reasonable prior notice
to the Company during the period prior to the Effective  Time or the
termination of this Agreement to all its and its Subsidiaries' properties,
books, Contracts, personnel and records and, during such period,  the 
Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each report, 
schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such 
period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws,  (b)
a copy of each correspondence or written communication with any United 
States Federal or state Governmental Entity and (c) all other information 
concerning its and its Subsidiaries' business, properties and personnel as 
Parent may reasonably request. Except for disclosures expressly  permitted by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement dated August 25,  2006, as amended
from time to time, between Parent and the Company (as it  may be  amended
from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), Parent shall hold,  and
shall cause its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial 
advisors and other Representatives to hold, all information received from 
the  Company, directly or indirectly, in confidence and otherwise in
accordance  with  the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation pursuant
to this  Section 5.02 or information provided or received by any party
hereto  pursuant to this Agreement will affect any of the representations or
warranties  of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement or the
conditions hereunder  to  the obligations of the parties hereto.

SECTION  5.03. _Commercially Reasonable  Efforts._ Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth  in this Agreement, each of the parties
agrees to use its commercially reasonable  efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to  be  done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things  necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most  expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts  to accomplish the
following: (i) the taking of all acts  necessary to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly  as  practicable, (ii) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions,  waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making  of all  necessary registrations and
filings (including filings with Governmental  Entities) and the taking of all
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval  or waiver from, or to avoid
an action or proceeding by, any Governmental  Entity  and (iii) the
obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers  from third
parties; provided that none of the Company, Parent or Sub shall  be 
required to make any payment to any such third parties or concede anything 
of  value to obtain such consents. In connection with and without  limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable 
after the date of this Agreement, duly file with the U.S. Federal Trade 
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice the 
notification and report form (the "HSR Filing") required under the HSR Act
and  with the applicable Canadian Governmental Entities the filings (the
"Canadian  Filings") required under the Competition Act (Canada) and the
Investment Canada  Act (Canada) (collectively, the "Canadian Competition
Laws"), in each case with  respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The HSR  Filing and the Canadian Filings shall be in substantial
compliance with the  requirements of the HSR Act and the Canadian Competition
Laws, as  applicable. Each party shall cooperate with the other party to
the  extent necessary to assist the other party in the preparation of its
HSR  Filing  and the Canadian Filings, to request early termination of the
waiting period  required by the HSR Act and, if requested, to promptly amend
or furnish  additional information thereunder. The Company and Parent shall 
furnish to each other's counsel such necessary information and reasonable 
assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with its 
preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary in connection with 
the  HSR Filing and the Canadian Filings and with any inquiry or
communication  with  or from any Governmental Entity in connection
therewith. The Company  and its Board of Directors shall (1) take all action
necessary to ensure  that no state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes  applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and (2) if any state
takeover statute or  similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of  the  other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, take all action necessary  to  ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement  may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by  this  Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation  on  this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require  Parent, the
Company or any Subsidiary to agree to, or proffer to, divest  or hold 
separate any assets or any portion of any business of Parent, the Company  or
any  of their respective Subsidiaries and neither the Company nor any of
its  Subsidiaries shall, without Parent's written consent, agree to, or
proffer to,  divest or hold separate any assets or any portion of its
business;  _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, at Parent's
request, the  Company or any Subsidiary shall agree to, or proffer to, divest
or hold separate  any assets or any portion of its business so long as such
divestiture or  holding  separate shall occur no earlier than, and be
conditioned upon the occurrence  of,  the consummation of the Merger.

soon as practicable following the date  of this Agreement, the Board of

administering the Company Stock Plans)  shall  adopt such resolutions or
take such other actions as may be required to effect  the following:

 

 

(i) adjust  the terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options, whether
vested or unvested,  as necessary to provide that the Company Stock Options
will become fully  exercisable and may be exercised before the Effective Time
at such applicable  time or times as specified in the Company Stock Plans,
and, at the Effective  Time, each Company Stock Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective  Time shall be canceled and the holder
thereof shall then become entitled  to  receive, in full satisfaction of the
rights of such holder with respect thereto,  as soon as practicable following
the Effective Time, a single lump sum cash  payment equal to the product of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common  Stock  for which such Company
Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised  and (B) the excess,
if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise  price  per share of
such Company Stock Option;

 

 

(ii) adjust  the terms of all outstanding Company Restricted Shares as
necessary to provide  that each Company Restricted Share outstanding
immediately prior to the  Effective Time will vest in full and be converted
into the right to receive  the  Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01(c);

 

 

(iii) make  such changes to the Company Stock Plans or any other Company
Benefit Plan  or  Company Benefit Agreement as the Company and Parent may
agree are appropriate  to  clarify that if the Closing occurs during the
2007 fiscal year prior to December  15, 2007, or during the 2008 fiscal year
prior to December 15, 2008, the  Company's non-employee directors immediately
prior to the Effective Time will  each be paid, on the Closing Date, an
amount in cash equal to (A) $60,000  multiplied by (B) a fraction, (I) the
numerator of which is the number of  months  that have fully elapsed in the
year in which the Closing occurs through the  Closing Date _plus_ one and
(II) the denominator of which is 12;  and

 

 

(iv) make  such other changes to the Company Stock Plans as the Company and
Parent may  agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger.

 

 

(b) All  amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.04(a) shall be subject to
any  required withholding of taxes and shall be paid without interest as
soon  as  practicable following the Effective Time.

Company Stock  Plan, Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement shall
have any right  thereunder to acquire any Capital Stock of the Company, the
Surviving  Corporation or their Subsidiaries or any other equity interest
therein  (including "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights).

 

 

(d) Prior  to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary in order  to  cause any dispositions of shares of Company Common
Stock (including derivative  securities with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock) resulting from  the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is subject  to  the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect  to  the Company to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange  Act.

 

 

SECTION  5.05. _Indemnification; Advancement of Expenses;  Exculpation and
Insurance._ (a) Parent shall cause the  Surviving Corporation to assume the
obligations with respect to all rights  to  indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities  for  acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time now existing  in  favor of the current or
former directors or officers of the Company as provided  in the Company
Certificate, the Company Bylaws or any indemnification Contract  between such
directors or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect  on the
date hereof), without further action, as of the Effective Time and  such 
obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and 
effect  in accordance with their terms.

 

 

(b) In  the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns  (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not
the  continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger  or  (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and  other assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause  proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving  Corporation shall expressly assume the obligations
set forth in this  Section 5.05.

(c) Parent  shall obtain, at the Effective Time, prepaid (or "tail")
directors' and  officers' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or  prior to the Effective Time covering each person currently
covered by the  Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
(a complete and  accurate copy of which has been heretofore delivered to
Parent) for six years  from the Effective Time, on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts  no  less favorable than those of such policy in effect
on the date of this  Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying
its obligation  under this Section 5.05(c), Parent shall not be obligated to
pay more than  $1,000,000 in the aggregate to obtain such coverage. It is
understood  and agreed that in the event such coverage cannot be obtained for
$1,000,000  or  less in the aggregate, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a
policy providing  such coverage as may be obtained for such $1,000,000
aggregate  amount.

 

 

(d) The  provisions of this Section 5.05 (i) are intended to be for the
benefit  of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her

in substitution  for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such person  may have by contract or otherwise.

(iii) (A) prior  to the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval, a Takeover
Proposal shall have  been made to the Company or shall have been made
directly to the stockholders  of  the Company generally or shall have
otherwise become publicly known or any  person shall have publicly announced
an intention (whether or not conditional)  to make a Takeover Proposal, (B)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by  either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but only if a  vote to obtain the Stockholder
Approval or the Stockholders' Meeting has not  been held) or Section
7.01(b)(iii) and (C) within 12 months after such  termination, the Company
enters into a definitive Contract to consummate,  or  consummates, the

(c) The  Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in  Section 5.06(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by  this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent
would not enter  into  this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails
promptly to pay the  amount due pursuant to Section 5.06(b), and, in order to
obtain such  payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company  for the Parent Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to
Parent its costs  and  expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit,  together with interest on the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee from the  date  such payment was required to be made
until the date of payment at a rate  equal  to 2% plus the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment  was required to be made
(the "Default Rate").

 

 

SECTION  5.07. _Public Announcements._ Except with  respect to any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with  the  terms of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other  before
issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment  upon, 
any press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall
not issue  any  such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation,  except as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable  law,  court process or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any  national securities exchange or national
securities quotation  system. The parties agree that all formal Company
employee  communication programs or announcements with respect to the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the forms mutually
agreed to by  the  parties (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld
or  delayed). The parties agree that the initial press release to be  issued
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall  be 
in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

 

 

SECTION  5.08. _Stockholder Litigation._ The  Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or  settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its  directors relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and  no  such settlement shall
be agreed to without Parent's prior written  consent.

SECTION  5.09. _Employee  Matters._ (a) Except as otherwise provided in
any  applicable collective bargaining agreement, from the Effective Time
through  the  first anniversary of the Effective Time, the employees of the
Company employed  primarily in the United States who remain in the employment
of the Surviving  Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the "Continuing
Employees") shall receive  employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the  employee benefits provided to such
Continuing Employees immediately prior  to the  Effective Time; _provided_
that neither Parent nor the Surviving  Corporation nor any of their
Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to issue,  or  adopt any plans or
arrangements providing for the issuance of, shares of  Capital  Stock,
warrants, options, stock appreciation rights or other rights in respect  of
any shares of Capital Stock of any entity or any securities convertible  or 
exchangeable into such Capital Stock pursuant to any such plans or
arrangements;  _provided_ _further_ that no plans or arrangements of the
Company or  any of its Subsidiaries providing for such issuance shall be
taken into account  in determining whether employee benefits are
substantially comparable in  the  aggregate. Any change in benefits that is
adopted prior to the  Effective Time but becomes effective on or after the
Effective Time and any  other change in benefits (including changes in
vendors, co-payments, deductibles  and life-time maximums) that would have
been made by the Company or its  Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of
business during calendar year 2007  (or  2008, if the Closing occurs after
December 31, 2007) to reflect market  conditions of the provision of those
benefits shall be deemed to have been  in  effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of this  Section 5.09(a).

 

 

(b) Parent  shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize the service of
each  Continuing Employee as if such service had been performed with Parent
(i)  for  purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not
benefit accrual)  under Parent's defined contribution plan, (ii) for purposes
of eligibility  for vacation under Parent's vacation program, (iii) for
purposes of  eligibility and participation under any health or welfare plan
maintained  by  Parent (other than any post-employment health or post-
employment welfare  plan)  and (iv) unless covered under another arrangement
with or of the Company,  for benefit accrual purposes under Parent's
severance plan (in the case of each  of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv),
solely to the extent that Parent  makes such plan or program available to
employees of the Surviving Corporation,  and except as would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period  of  service), but not for
purposes of any other employee benefit plan of  Parent.

 

 

(c) Except  to the extent set forth in paragraph (m) of Section 4.01(a) of
the Disclosure  Schedule, nothing contained herein shall be construed as
requiring, and the  Company shall take no action that would have the effect
of requiring, Parent  or  the Surviving Corporation to establish, maintain
or continue any specific  plans  or to continue the employment of any
specific person. Furthermore,  except to the extent set forth in paragraph
(m) of Section 4.01(a) of the  Disclosure Schedule, no provision of this
Agreement shall be construed as  prohibiting or limiting the ability of
Parent or the Surviving Company to  amend,  modify or terminate any plans,
programs, policies, arrangements, agreements  or  understandings of Parent,
the Company or the Surviving  Company. Without limiting the scope of Section
8.07, nothing in this  Section 5.09 shall confer any rights or remedies of
any kind or description  upon  any Continuing Employee or any other person
other than Parent, the Company  and  their respective successors and
assigns.

(d) With  respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which
Continuing Employees  are eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall  cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) use
reasonable efforts to waive all  limitations as to preexisting conditions and
exclusions with respect to  participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees to the  extent such conditions and exclusions
were satisfied or did not apply to  such  employees under the welfare plans
of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior  to  the Effective Time and (ii)
provide each Continuing Employee with credit  for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in  satisfying any analogous
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements incurred  in  the same year as the
Effective Time to the extent applicable under any such  plan.

 

 

(e) With  respect to the employees of the Company who are employed primarily
outside  the  United States, following the Effective Time, Parent and its
Subsidiaries  will  provide such employees with employee benefits in
accordance with applicable  law.

 

 

(f) As  soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company  shall amend the Company Benefit Plans listed in paragraph (m) of
Section  4.01(a)  of the Disclosure Schedule or take such other actions as
necessary to reflect  the terms set forth in such paragraph.

 

 

SECTION  5.10. _Cooperation with Respect to  Financing._ The Company shall
provide, and shall cause its  Subsidiaries and its and their officers and
employees to provide, on a  reasonably timely basis all reasonable
cooperation in connection with the  arrangement of any financing to be
consummated by Parent in connection with  the  transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  5.11. _Cooperation with Respect to Governmental  Entities._ The
parties shall, through their counsel, keep each  other informed with respect
to communications with, to and from Governmental  Entities regarding the
transactions contemplated hereunder and shall through  their counsel afford
each other a reasonable opportunity to participate in  all  communications
and meetings with Governmental Entities and to have input  into  all filings
and submissions to Governmental Entities regarding the transactions 
contemplated hereunder.

 

 

SECTION  5.12. _Convertible Notes._ Each of the  Company, Parent and Sub
shall take each action required to be taken by such  party pursuant to the
Indenture dated as of March 26, 2007, between the Company  and Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association in connection with the  Merger. The Company shall
comply with the terms of the instruments  relating to the Convertible Notes
as in effect as of the date of this  Agreement.

SECTION  5.13. _Severance  Matters._ (a) Parent and Sub covenant and agree
that,  except as otherwise set forth in Schedule 5.13(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule,  on  or before the date which is 60 days after the date of this
Agreement, with  respect to each person listed on Schedule 5.13(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule  (the "Officer and Other Employee List"), Parent will
provide to the Company a date on which it expects to terminate such person's
employment with the Company  (the termination date for such person being
referred to herein as such person's "Officer and Other Employee Termination
Date") with each Officer and Other  Employee Termination Date to be (a) no
later than the date which is six months  after the Closing Date (it being
understood that such Officer and Employee  Termination Date may be expressed
in the number of months (not to exceed  six  months) after the Closing Date
for which such employee's services will be  required) and (b) determined by
Parent in good faith based on Parent's  reasonable expectation as to the
amount of time for which Parent will require  such person's services after
the Closing in connection with the transition to  Parent's ownership of the
Company. In addition, except as set forth  in Schedule 5.13(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule, Parent will cause the Company  to  pay to each person
on the Officer and Other Employee List the severance pay  entitled to him or
her from the Company on the earlier of the Officer and  Other  Employee
Termination Date for such person or such person's earlier termination  of
employment with the Company; _provided_ that, as a condition to  receiving
any such severance pay, each such person may be required by Parent  to 
continue his or her service with the Company up to such person's Officer and 
Other Employee Termination Date (unless such person is earlier terminated  by
the  Company or Parent (other than for cause)) and to also sign a waiver and
release  of claims against the Company, Parent and their affiliates for any
claims  incurred prior to such person's termination. For the avoidance of 
doubt, except as set forth in Schedule 5.13(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, 
each  employee who is included in the Officer and Other Employee List shall
be  entitled to receive a severance payment on or prior to such person's
Officer and  Other Employee Termination Date so long as the employee agrees
to continue  and  does continue his or her service with the Company up to
such Officer and  Other  Employee Termination Date (unless earlier
terminated by the Company or Parent  (other than for cause)) and signs a
waiver and release of claims in a form  reasonably acceptable to Parent.

 

 

(b) Parent  and Sub covenant and agree that on or before the date which is 30
days after  the  date of this Agreement, with respect to each person listed
on Schedule  
5.13(b) of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Accounting and IT List"), Parent 
will provide to the Company (i) a list of those persons on the Accounting 
and IT  List which Parent reasonably and in good faith expects the Company or
Parent  will continue to employ following six months after the Closing Date
and who  will  be offered permanent employment with the Company or Parent
(all other persons  on  the Accounting and IT List, the "Accounting and IT
Terminated Employees") and  (ii) the date on which it expects to terminate
each Accounting and IT Terminated  Employee's employment with the Company
(the termination date for such Accounting  and IT Terminated Employee being
referred to herein as such Accounting and  IT  Terminated Employee's
"Accounting and IT Termination Date") with each such  termination date to be
(a) no later than the date which is six months after  the  Closing Date (it
being understood that each Accounting and IT Termination  Date  may be
expressed in the number of months (not to exceed six months) after  the 
Closing Date for which such employee's services will be required) and (b) 
determined by Parent in good faith based on Parent's reasonable expectation
as  to the amount of time for which Parent will require such Accounting and
IT  Terminated Employee's services after the Closing in connection with the 
transition to Parent's ownership of the Company. In addition, Parent  will
cause the Company to pay to each Accounting and IT Terminated Employee  the 
severance pay entitled to him or her from the Company on the earlier of the 
Accounting and IT Termination Date for such person or such person's earlier 
termination of employment with the Company; _provided_ that, as a condition 
to receiving any such severance pay, each such person may be required by 
Parent  to continue his or her service with the Company up to such person's
Accounting  and IT Termination Date (unless such person is earlier terminated
by the  Company  or Parent (other than for cause)) and to also sign a waiver
and release of  claims against the Company, Parent and their affiliates for
any claims incurred  prior to such person's termination. For those employees
on the  Accounting and IT List who are not Accounting and IT Terminated
Employees,  the  Company may inform such employees that Parent has indicated
to the Company  that  Parent desires to retain their services on a permanent
basis after the  Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, each employee who is
included in  the Accounting and IT List and who is designated as an
Accounting and IT  Terminated Employee shall be entitled to receive a
severance payment so long  as  the employee agrees to continue and does
continue his or her service with  the  Company up to such person's
Accounting and IT Termination Date (unless earlier  terminated by the Company
or Parent (other than for cause)) and signs a waiver  and release of claims
in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent.

it shall have power to  indemnify under said Section from and against any and
all of the expenses,  liabilities, or other matters referred to in or covered
by said  Section. Such indemnification shall be mandatory and not 
discretionary. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be  deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled 
under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors 
or  otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to
action  in  another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue
as to a person  who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent
and shall inure  to  the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators
of such a  person. Any repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH shall
not  adversely affect any right to indemnification of any persons existing
at  the  time of such repeal or modification with respect to any matter
occurring  prior  to such repeal or modification.

The  Corporation shall to the fullest extent permitted by the General
Corporation  Law  of the State of Delaware advance all costs and expenses
(including, without  limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by
any director or officer  within 15 days of the presentation of same to the
Corporation, with respect  to any one or more actions, suits or proceedings,
whether civil, criminal,  administrative or investigative, so long as the
Corporation receives from  the  director or officer an unsecured undertaking
to repay such expenses if it  shall  ultimately be determined that such
director or officer is not entitled to  be  indemnified by the Corporation
under the General Corporation Law of the State  of  Delaware. Such
obligation to advance costs and expenses shall be mandatory,  and  not
discretionary, and shall include, without limitation, costs and expenses 
incurred in asserting affirmative defenses, counterclaims and cross  claims.
Such undertaking to repay may, if first requested in writing  by the
applicable director or officer, be on behalf of (rather than by) such 
director or officer, provided that in such case the Corporation shall have 
the  right to approve the party making such undertaking.

 

 

_EIGHTH_ : Unless  and except to the extent that the Bylaws of the
Corporation shall so require,  the election of directors of the Corporation
need not be by written  ballot.
