Non-controlling Party advised of the status of such Third Party Action and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the
Controlling Party with such information as it may have with respect to such Third Party Action (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or
other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such Third Party Action. The fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party with respect to a Third Party
Action shall be considered Damages for purposes of this Agreement if (i) the Indemnified Party controls the defense of such Third Party Action pursuant to the terms of this Section 7.3(a) or (ii) the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such
defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes (based on the advice of counsel) that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests or different defenses available with respect to such Third Party Action. The
