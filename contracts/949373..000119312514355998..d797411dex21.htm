representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE OFFER AND THE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME_

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer._

 

(a) Subject to the following sentence, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to), as promptly as practicable and in no event later than five
business days after the date of this Agreement, with prior notice to the
Company, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act)
the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to (and of Parent to cause Purchaser
to) accept for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted under applicable Laws) of the conditions set forth in
Annex B (the "Tender Offer Conditions"), and no other conditions. The initial
expiration date of the Offer shall be 12:00 midnight (Eastern Time) at the end
of the day on the date that is 20 business days after the date on which the
Offer was commenced (determined as provided in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act) (the initial "Expiration Time" and any expiration time and date
established pursuant to an extension of the Offer in accordance with this
Agreement, also an Expiration Time). Purchaser expressly reserves the right
(i) to increase the Offer Price and (ii) to waive any condition to the Offer
(to the extent permitted under applicable Laws) or modify the terms of the
Offer, except that, without the prior written consent of the Company,
Purchaser shall not (A) reduce the number of Shares subject to the Offer, (B)
reduce the Offer Price, (C) waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (D) add to the
Tender Offer Conditions or amend or modify any Tender Offer Condition in any
manner adverse to the holders of Shares, (E) except as otherwise provided in
this Section 1.1, extend the Expiration Time, or (F) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer,  _provided_ , that nothing in this clause
(F) shall limit Purchasers ability to provide additional cash consideration
in addition to the Offer Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) Purchaser
may, without the consent of the Company, (i) extend the Expiration Time for
one or more consecutive increments of not more than 20 business days each (the
length of such period to be determined by Parent or Purchaser), if at any
otherwise scheduled Expiration Time any Tender Offer Condition has not been
satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted under applicable Laws), (ii)
extend the Expiration Time for the minimum period required by any rule,

 



2  regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer, or (iii)
make available a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act and (y) Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) extend the Expiration Time at the request of the Company for one
or more consecutive increments of not more than 20 business days (the length
of such periods to be determined by Parent) if at any otherwise scheduled
Expiration Time any Tender Offer Condition has not been satisfied or waived
(to the extent permitted under applicable Laws); _provided_ that in the case
of any extension of the Expiration Date pursuant to either (x) or (y) above,
such extension shall in no event extend of Expiration Date to a time later
than, the earlier of (1) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms and (2) the Termination Date. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) accept for payment all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable after the
Expiration Time (the time and date on which Purchaser accepts such Shares for
payment, the "Acceptance Time"), and pay for such Shares as promptly as
practicable following the Acceptance Time. Parent shall (or shall cause
Purchaser or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
to) provide or cause to be provided to a paying agent (which shall be a
reputable bank or trust company) selected by Parent (the "Paying Agent") on a
timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term "business day" shall have the meaning provided in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act, and the term "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any
Person, any other Person of which at least a majority of the securities or
ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a
majority of the board of directors or other Persons performing similar
functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such Person and/or
by one or more of its Subsidiaries.

(b) On the date on which the Offer is commenced, Parent and Purchaser shall
file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 and Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents
included therein, together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the "Offer Documents"), shall make all deliveries, mailings and
telephonic notices required by Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, and shall
cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to
the extent required by the United States federal securities Laws and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder (collectively, the
"Securities Laws"). Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Offer Documents to
comply in all material respects with the Securities Laws. Parent and Purchaser
shall deliver copies of the proposed forms of the Offer Documents (including
any amendments or supplements thereto) to the Company within a reasonable
time prior to the dissemination or filing thereof for review and comment by
the Company and its counsel. Parent and Purchaser shall respond promptly to
any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer or the Offer
Documents. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by the Securities Laws. Parent and
Purchaser shall amend or supplement the Offer Documents and cause the Offer
Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to
be disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Securities Laws and subject to the terms

 



3  and conditions of this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall provide the
Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform
them of any oral comments, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
the receipt of such comments and shall give the Company a reasonable
opportunity under the circumstances to review and comment on any written or
oral responses to such comments. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion
in the Offer Documents a description of the Board Actions and the Company
Recommendation as it may be amended or modified, and until but not after it
is withdrawn, in each case as permitted by this Agreement. The Company shall
promptly furnish to Parent and Purchaser all information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries and the Companys stockholders that may be
required or reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated
by this Section 1.1(b).

Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) On the date the Offer Documents are first filed with the SEC, the Company
shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments,
supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9"), which, subject to
Section 6.1(b), shall contain the Company Recommendation and a description of
the other Board Actions. Parent shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
disseminated to the holders of Shares along with the Offer Documents, in
accordance with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act and the Securities Laws.
The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects
with the Securities Laws. The Company shall deliver copies of the proposed
form of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendments or supplements thereto)
to Parent within a reasonable time prior to the dissemination or filing
thereof for review and comment by Parent and its counsel. The Company shall
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to
the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by the Securities Laws. The Company
shall amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and cause the Schedule 14D-9, as
so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Securities Laws. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with copies
of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the
Company or its counsel receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall give
Parent a reasonable opportunity under the circumstances to review and comment
on any written or oral responses to such comments. Parent and Purchaser shall
promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent, Purchaser
and the Offer that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with
any action contemplated by this Section 1.2(a).

 

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished to Purchaser (i) a list of the names and addresses of the
record holders of Shares as of the most recent practicable date, as well as
mailing labels containing such names and addresses and (ii) security position
lists, computer files and any other information identifying the beneficial
owners of Shares, in each case as of the most recent practicable date which
the Company or its transfer agent have in their possession or control or can
obtain without

 



4  unreasonable effort or expense. The Company shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to Purchaser such additional information (including updates to the
items provided pursuant to the preceding sentence) and such other assistance
as Purchaser may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record
and beneficial owners of Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable
Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent
and Purchaser and their agents shall hold in confidence the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 1.3 _Company Directors_. In the event that the Closing does not occur
within two business days of the Acceptance Time (but only for so long as
Parent, Purchaser and their Affiliates beneficially own at least a majority of
the outstanding Shares), the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate
with one another to cause the appointment to the Company Board of that number
of directors designated by Purchaser, rounded up to the nearest whole number,
as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on the board of
directors of the Company (giving effect to the directors elected or
designated by Purchaser pursuant to this sentence) _multiplied_ _by_ the
percentage of the outstanding Shares (determined on a fully diluted basis)
that are then beneficially owned by Purchaser and its Affiliates. In the
event that Purchasers designees are elected or appointed to the board of
directors of the Company pursuant to this Section 1.3, then, until the
Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall allow at least two members of the
board of directors of the Company to consist of individuals who were members
of the board of directors of the Company on the date hereof (the "Existing
Directors"). If at any time prior to the Effective Time when Purchasers
designees constitute a majority of the board of directors of the Company, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Existing Directors shall be required to
(and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the board of
directors of the Company and no other action on the part of the Company,
including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required
to) (i) amend, modify or terminate this Agreement on behalf of the Company,
(ii) exercise or waive any of the Companys rights or remedies under this
Agreement, (iii) extend the time for performance of Parents or Purchasers
obligations under this Agreement or (iv) enforce any obligation of Parent or
Purchaser under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the terms
"beneficial ownership" (and its correlative terms) and "Affiliate" shall have
the meanings provided in Rule 13d-3 and Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act,
respectively. 

Section 1.4 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate
corporate existence of Purchaser shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger under the DGCL (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall be governed by
Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall be effected on the Closing Date without a
meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 251(h) of
the DGCL; provided that if, notwithstanding such express election to cause the
Merger to be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL, the Merger may not be
effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL for any reason, then the
parties hereto shall take all actions necessary to cause the consummation of
the Merger as promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time in a
manner that is not adverse to the stockholders of the Company.

 



5 Section 1.5 _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times
Square, New York, New York, as soon as practicable following the Acceptance
Time, on a date to be specified by the parties hereto, which shall be no
later than the first business day following the day on which the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied only at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall
be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement or at such other
place or on such other date and time as Parent and the Company may mutually
agree (the date on which the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date").

Section 1.6 _Effective Time_. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company and
Parent will cause a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the
DGCL (the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as is
specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed to by the Company and
Parent in writing, being the "Effective Time") and shall make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL (if any).

ARTICLE III

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;_

 

 _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company or Purchaser:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i) Shares owned by
Parent, Purchaser or any other Affiliate of Parent that is directly or
indirectly wholly owned by the ultimate parent of Parent, (ii) Shares owned by
the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company
and (iii) any Shares the holder of which has (A) demanded and perfected such
holders right to dissent from the Merger and to be paid the fair value of
such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and (B) as of the
Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters rights
("Dissenting Shares") (each of such Shares described in clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii), an "Excluded Share" and collectively, the "Excluded Shares")) shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price
(the "Per Share Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all of the
Shares (other than the Excluded Shares) shall cease to be outstanding, shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and thereafter any Shares
represented by a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") and any
uncertificated Shares represented by book-entry (the "Book-Entry Shares") (in
each case, other than the Excluded Shares) shall represent only the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(b) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of the Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding and automatically be
cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor, subject to any rights
the holder thereof may have under Section 3.2.

 

(c) _Purchaser_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 3.2 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each
Dissenting Share shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, but the holder thereof, if such holder
complies in all respects with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenters
Rights"), shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the Dissenters Rights; _provided_ , _however_ _
_,__ that if any such

 



7  holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to dissent under the Dissenters Rights, then the right of such holder
to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to
receive, the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest thereon and
subject to any applicable withholding Taxes specified in Section 3.3(f).

(b) The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent and its counsel of any
demands, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company for
Dissenters Rights with respect to any Shares, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in, and direct ( _provided_ _,_ that such direction may
not result in a binding obligation on the part of the Company that is
effective prior to the Effective Time), all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such
demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds
necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments under Section 3.1(a) (such
cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Paying Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America
in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or the equivalent by Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion,
or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category
granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a
combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall
have a maturity exceeding three months. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and
any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 3.1(a) shall be
promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (at Parents
election).

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within five business days thereafter) the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (or, in the
case of "street-holders," deliver to the Depository Trust Company)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of Excluded
Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form, reasonably acceptable
to the parties hereto, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 3.3(e)) or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in
Section 3.3(e)) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit

 



8  of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 3.3(e)) or Book-
Entry Shares to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall solely be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount
in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 3.3(f)) equal to (x) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the
Certificate as provided in Section 3.3(e)) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by
(y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check or wire
(pursuant to instructions set forth in the letter of transmittal) for any cash
to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares may
be issued to such transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant
to this Article III.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (at
Parents election). Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has
not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
3.3(f)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates as provided in Section 3.3(e)) or Book-Entry Shares,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall
be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount delivered to any
Governmental Entity pursuant to and in compliance with applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Person" shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or
other entity of any kind or nature.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount and upon such reasonable terms as may be required by
Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue a check or wire (pursuant to instructions set forth in the letter of
transmittal) in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



9 (f) _FIRPTA; Withholding Rights_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent at the Closing a certificate,
substantially in the form provided for in Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and
1.897-2(h) of the Treasury Regulations, establishing that the Company is not a
"United States real property holding corporation" within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), and has not been such a United States real property holding
corporation within the five year period ending on the Closing Date, and a
copy of notice provided to the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") in accordance
with the provisions of Section 1.897-2(h)(2) of the Treasury regulations. Each
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it reasonably
determines in good faith it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be.

 

(g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or to such Book-Entry Shares.

 

Section 3.4 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Prior to, and effective as of, the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all necessary action to accelerate the vesting of each
outstanding option to purchase Shares under the Stock Plans (each, a "Company
Option"), that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Option, vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
total number of Shares subject to the Company Option times (y) the excess, if
any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share
under such Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment as provided in Section 3.3(f). In the event that the
exercise price per Share under any Company Option, as adjusted, is equal to or
greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment therefor and shall have no
further force or effect.

(b) _Treatment of Other Awards Under Stock Plans_. At the Effective Time,
each outstanding award of a right (other than awards of Company Options)
entitling the holder thereof to Shares or cash equal to or based on the value
of Shares, including any restricted stock units, (a "Share Unit") issued
under the Stock Plans that is outstanding or payable as of

 



10  immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall
be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, a cash
payment equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares subject to such Share
Unit and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment as provided in Section
3.3(f). At the Effective Time, each holder of a Share Unit shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.4(b).

 

(c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section
3.4(a) and Section 3.4(b). The Company shall take all actions necessary to
ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the
Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Options,
Share Units or otherwise.

Section 3.5 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the number of issued and
outstanding Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares changes as a result of a reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Offer Price and the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of Shares the
same economic effect as contemplated by Article III prior to such change;
_provided_ that nothing in this Section 3.5 shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

ARTICLE IV

any of its Subsidiaries. The Company is not party to any agreement
granting registration rights to any Person.

(c) Section 4.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) each of
the Companys Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company in each
such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person or
Persons in each such Subsidiary and (ii) the Companys or its
Subsidiaries capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect
ownership interest in any other Person (other than securities in a publicly
traded company held for investment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and consisting of less than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of such
Person). Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of each of the Companys Subsidiaries and each share of capital
stock or other equity interests set forth on Section 4.2(c)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and owned free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge,
security interest, claim or other Encumbrance (each, a "Lien"). The Company
does not own, directly or indirectly, any voting interest in any Person that

Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Each Company Option (i) has an exercise price per Share equal to or
greater than the fair market value of a Share on the effective date of such

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries
have no material indebtedness for borrowed money and (ii) there are no

similar instruments issued for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

Section 4.3 _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness Opinion_. The Company
has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part
of the Company are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, other than in the case of the
Merger the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the
Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization,

 



14  execution and delivery hereof by Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) (the
"Bankruptcy and Equity Exception"). The board of directors of the Company has
received the opinion of Stifel, Nicolaus and Company, Incorporated to the effect
that, as of the date of the opinion, and subject to the assumptions and
qualifications set forth therein, the Offer Price and Per Share Merger
Consideration to be received by holders of the Shares in the Offer and the
Merger is fair from a financial point of view to such holders, a copy of
which opinion will be delivered to Parent, solely for informational purposes,
as promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement. The
board of directors of the Company has duly and unanimously adopted
resolutions, which have not subsequently been rescinded or modified in any
way, adopting the Board Actions. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Shares is the only vote of the holders of any
class or series of Company capital stock that, absent Section 251(h) of the
DGCL, would have been necessary under applicable Law and the Companys
certificate of incorporation and by-laws to adopt, approve or authorize this
Agreement and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby in their capacity as stockholders of the Company.

Section 4.4 _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts_.

(a) No notices, reports, filings consents, waivers, registrations, approvals,
orders, permits or authorizations (each an "Approval") are, as applicable
required to be made or obtained by the Company from, any federal, state,
local, multinational or foreign governmental, administrative or regulatory
(including stock exchange) authority, agency, commission, body, court or
other legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity (each a
"Governmental Entity"), in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, other than
(i) any Approvals required (A) under the HSR Act, (B) under applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act (including filing of the Schedule 14D-9
in connection with the Offer), (C) under applicable requirements of the
NASDAQ Global Market ("NASDAQ") or (D) under applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii)
the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of
the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL and (iii) such other
Approvals which the failure to make or obtain, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (i) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation
or by-laws of the Company or the comparable governing documents of any of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) assuming that the Approvals referred to in Section
4.4(a) are duly obtained or made, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, a material breach or violation of, any Law to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is subject or (iii) with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, a breach or violation of, a termination, cancellation or modification
(or provide a right of termination, cancellation or modification) or default
under, the payment of additional fees, the creation, change or acceleration
of any rights or obligations

 



15  under, any requirement to provide notice to, or require consent or approval
from, the other party thereto, or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, pursuant to any
Contract binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the

forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), since January 1, 2013 (the
forms, statements, reports and documents filed or furnished since January 1,
2013 and those filed or furnished subsequent to the date of this Agreement,
including any amendments thereto, the "Company Reports"). No Subsidiary of the
Company is required to file, or files, any form, report or other document
with the SEC. Each of the Company Reports, as of the respective date of its
filing or being furnished complied (or, if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of such amended or
superseded filing) or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley
Act"), and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the
Company Reports. As of their respective dates of filing (and, in the case of
any Company Report that is a registration statement, as of its effective date)
(or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, on the date of such amended or superseded filing), the Company
Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC
subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

 

(b) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Except as
permitted by the Exchange Act, including Section 13(k)(2) and Section 13(k)(3)
thereof or the rules of the SEC, since December 31, 2011, neither the Company
nor any of its Affiliates has made, arranged or modified any extensions of
credit in the form of a personal loan to any executive officer or director of
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries is a party to,
or has any commitment to become a party to, (i) any joint venture, off-

relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the Securities
Act)), and including similar collaboration, participation or off-set
arrangements or obligations, where the result, purpose or effect of such

Financial Statements, or (ii) any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship with, or ownership or other economic interest in, any variable
interest entity.

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it is required to file or submit, or files
or submits, under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act are recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms. The Company maintains internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the
Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in
providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that
could have a material effect on its financial statements. The Company has
disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer
and its chief financial officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to the
Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Companys board of
directors (A) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and has identified for the Companys auditors and
audit committee of the Companys board of directors any material weaknesses in
internal control over financial reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

 

(e) Each of the consolidated financial statements included in or incorporated
by reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) (the "Company Financial Statements") (i) complies in all material
respects with the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the Exchange
Act and the Securities Act, (ii) has been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied, in all material respects, on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the Company Financial Statements or in
the notes thereto and subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnote disclosure) and (iii)
fairly presents, or, in the case of any Company Financial Statements filed
after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows (and changes in financial position, if any) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date and for the periods referred to in
the Company Financial Statements. Each required form, report and document
containing financial statements that has been filed with or submitted to the
SEC after December 31, 2011 was accompanied by the certificates required to be
filed or submitted by the Companys chief executive officer and chief
financial officer pursuant to the

 



17  Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, at the time of filing or submission of each such
certificate, such certificate was true and accurate and complied in all
material respects with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

(f) After December 31, 2011 through the date of this Agreement, to the
knowledge of the Company (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any director, officer, employee, auditor or accountant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has received any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, that the Company or
its Subsidiaries have engaged in illegal or fraudulent accounting or auditing
practices, and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported to the board of directors of the Company or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Company any evidence of
a material violation of Securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation, relating to periods after December 31, 2011, by the Company or any
of its officers, directors, employees or agents. As of the date of this
Agreement, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no SEC inquiries or

threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any malfeasance by any executive officer of the
Company.

Section 6.2 _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, nor shall it authorize or permit
their respective Representatives directly or indirectly to:

 

(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage, induce or assist any inquiries or
the making, submission, announcement or consummation of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal;

 

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide or furnish any information or data
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than to notify a
Person of the provisions of this Section 6.2), or afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books, records or personnel of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser, or
any of their respective Affiliates, designees or Representatives) that could
reasonably be expected to initiate, solicit, encourage, induce or assist the
making, submission or commencement of any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

 



39 (iii) approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar

or oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other

(iv) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

 

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, if the Company has
not breached this Section 6.2, the Company may (A) participate in discussions
regarding such Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms of such
Acquisition Proposal, (B) provide information (which may include non-public
information) in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives
from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms not more favorable to such other Person than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and which shall not prohibit the
Company from complying with the terms of this Section 6.2, and prior to or
concurrently delivers to Parent any such information to the extent not
previously provided to Parent and (C) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal of the type described in clause (B)
above, if and only to the extent that, prior to taking any action described
in clauses (B) and (C) above, the board of directors of the Company has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) that (x) failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law and (y) based on the information then available, such Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal.

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

"Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any proposal, indication of interest or offer
relating to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to a merger, joint
venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer,
exchange offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction or series of related transactions
involving the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries (as such term is
defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act and (ii) any
acquisition by any Person of, or proposal or offer, which if consummated
would result in any Person becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or
indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions, 10% or more of the
total voting power or of any class of equity securities of the Company or
those of any of its Subsidiaries, or the acquisition, purchase or disposition
of the business or 15% or more of the consolidated assets (including equity
securities of its Subsidiaries), revenues, net income or earnings of the
Company and its Subsidiaries outside the ordinary course of business, in each
case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

"Superior Proposal" means a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that would result in any Person (or its stockholders) becoming the
beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 80% of the assets (on a
consolidated basis) of the Company and its Subsidiaries or more than 80% of
the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the board
of directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation
with 

 



40  its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into
account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory, timing and
other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal, the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, the
availability of financing, and any conditions to consummation relating to
financing, regulatory approvals or other conditions beyond the control of the
party having the right to invoke the condition) and other aspects of the
Acquisition Proposal that the board of directors of the Company deems relevant
(i) is more favorable to the Companys stockholders (other than Parent and
its Affiliates) than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after
taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent and any other information provided by Parent pursuant to Section
6.2(c)) and (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated.

"Representatives" means, with respect to any Person, such Persons officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants
and other advisors or representatives.

 

(c) _No Change of Recommendation; No Other Agreements_. Neither the board of
directors of the Company, nor any committee thereof shall: 

(i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, (B)
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation, (C) publicly approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable any Acquisition Proposal or (D) publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing (any action or omission described in this clause (i) being referred
to as a "Change of Recommendation"); or

 

(ii) authorize, approve, recommend, declare advisable or permit (or publicly
propose to authorize, approve, recommend, declare advisable or permit) the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or agreement
that requires the Company to abandon or terminate this Agreement, the Offer
or the Merger, or any agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other
than this Agreement or a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
6.2(a) entered into in compliance with and subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 6.2(a)) (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement").

 

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing or otherwise set forth in this
Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Acceptance Time, the board
of directors of the Company may make a Change of Recommendation (and, solely
with respect to a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.3(b)) only if the board of directors of the Company has determined
in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel) that (x) failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y)
if such action relates to any Acquisition Proposal, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such action may be made pursuant to this Section 6.2(c) or Section 8.3(b)
until after at least four business days following Parents receipt of notice
from the Company (as may be extended

 



41  or renewed pursuant to this paragraph, the "Notice Period") advising that
the board of directors of the Company intends to take such action and the
basis therefor, including in the case of any Acquisition Proposal all
necessary information under Section 6.2(f) (which notice shall not constitute
a Change of Recommendation); _provided_ , _further_ that (i) during the Notice
Period, the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to enter into
any Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (ii) the Company shall, and shall cause
its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel to, negotiate with
Parent in good faith during the Notice Period (to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate) to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement that obviate the need of the board of directors of the Company to
make a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.3(b), including in the case of a Superior Proposal, by such Superior
Proposal no longer constituting a Superior Proposal, (iii) following the end
of the Notice Period, the board of directors of the Company shall
have considered in good faith any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent and any other information provided by Parent and shall have
determined (after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) that if such changes were to be given effect that failure to
make a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.3(b) would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and, in the case of clause (y) above, any such Superior
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal and (iv) in the
event of material modifications to the financial terms (including any
modifications to the form, amount or timing of payment of consideration) or
any other material terms of any Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each
case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in the first proviso of this paragraph and a new Notice Period
under this paragraph shall commence, during which time the Company shall be
required to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.2(c) anew with
respect to such additional notice, including clauses (i) through (iv) of this
proviso. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that a notice is
required under this Section 6.2(c) (in connection with a termination pursuant
to Section 8.3(b)) relates to a Superior Proposal for which the requisite
notice or additional notice has been given pursuant to this Section 6.2(c)
(in connection with a Change of Recommendation), no new or additional notice
or Notice Period will be required for such termination pursuant to Section
8.3(b).

 

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under United States federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure does
not reaffirm the Company Recommendation or has the substantive effect
of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, such
disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and Parent shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.4 (it
being understood that any "stop, look or listen" communication that contains
only the information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall
not be deemed to have the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely
modifying the Company Recommendation or otherwise deemed to violate the
Companys obligations under this Section 6.2(d)).

(e) _Existing Discussions and Agreements_. The Company agrees that it will,
and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives
to, immediately cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company also agrees that

 



42  (i) it will promptly request each Person that has executed a confidentiality
agreement prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with such Persons
consideration of a transaction involving, or the acquisition of, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (or any portion thereof) to return or destroy all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person or its
Representatives by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not release any party from, or
terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under,
any confidentiality or standstill provision in any agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and (iii) the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement, including by (x)
obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the
United States of America or of any state having jurisdiction and (y) taking
all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore
granted to any Person (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates) under the
provisions of any such agreement.

 

(f) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating,
in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material
terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including copies of any
written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and
terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto and,
in no event later than 24 hours after receipt, copies of any additional or
revised written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements)
and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change
in the Companys intentions as previously notified. The Company agrees that it
and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date hereof that prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with this Section 6.2(f). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing or Section 6.2(a), the Company shall notify
Parent in advance of beginning to provide information to any Person relating
to an Acquisition Proposal or beginning discussions or negotiations with any
Person regarding an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(g) Any violations of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.2 by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Section 6.2 by the Company.

Section 6.3 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 

(a) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as soon as practicable. In furtherance of, and not in
limitation of the foregoing, (i) each of Parent and the Company agree to make
an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the

 



43  HSR Act with respect to the Merger as soon as practicable after the date
hereof and in any event no later than ten business days after the date hereof

and to use their reasonable best efforts to supply as soon as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be reasonably
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this Section 6.3
(which may include divestitures, which shall be the sole responsibility of
Parent to accomplish, as practicable and subject to appropriate
cooperation obligations under this Section 6.3) necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
(including any extensions thereof) as soon as practicable (including by
requesting early termination of the waiting period thereunder) and (ii) each
of Parent and the Company agree to file as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary, proper and advisable notices, reports
and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary, proper and
advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in order to consummate the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
Agreement, including this Section 6.3(a), shall require either party, or
permit the Company, to undertake any efforts, or to take or consent to any
action, if such efforts, action or consent would be reasonably likely to
result in a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Parent shall have the
right to direct all matters with any Governmental Entity consistent with its
obligations hereunder; _provided_ , that, subject to reasonable limitations
limiting access to outside counsel, Parent and the Company shall (i) deliver
to each others antitrust counsel copies of all documents and information
reasonably required for the preparation and submission of filings to any
Governmental Entity related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any material oral or
written communication with any Governmental Entity regarding any such filings
or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii)
have the right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult with the other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in
connection with, any filing made with, or written materials submitted to or
other communication with any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv)
not independently participate in any meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving the other party hereto prior notice of the meeting and,
to the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Entity, the opportunity
to attend (which, at the request of any of the parties, shall be limited to
outside antitrust counsel only). In exercising the foregoing rights, each of
the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.
Neither the Company nor Parent shall extend any waiting period under the
Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Neither the Company nor Parent
shall take any action that would, or would be reasonably likely to,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Parent shall pay all filing fees required
in connection with filings under the Antitrust Laws.

 



44 (b) _Antitrust Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to
this Section 6.3, each of the Company and Parent agree to promptly provide to
each and every federal, state or foreign Governmental Entity with jurisdiction
over enforcement of the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other
United States federal or state or foreign or supranational Laws that are
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition (collectively, "Antitrust Laws") non-privileged
information and documents that are necessary, proper and advisable to permit
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) _Information_. Subject to reasonable limitations limiting access to
outside counsel, the Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other,
furnish the other promptly with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d)  _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and as required by any Governmental
Entity, and subject to reasonable restrictions limiting access to outside
counsel, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices,
correspondence, or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor Parent
shall permit any of its officers or any other Representatives or agents to
participate in any meeting or engage in any substantive communication with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the
other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat. Each of the Company and Parent shall, to the extent practicable, give
the other reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or communication and in
the event one party is prohibited by Law or a Governmental Entity from
participating in or attending any such meeting or engaging in any such
communication, keep such party reasonably apprised with respect thereto.

Section 6.4 _Access and Reports_. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents officers and other
"your Representatives" (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
reasonable access during normal business hours throughout the period prior to
the Effective Time, to its employees, properties, books, contracts and
records and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested; _provided_
that such access shall be conducted under the supervision of appropriate
personnel of the Company and in such a manner so as not to interfere with the

affect the remedies available to Parent;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would

of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have
used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
inspection or disclosure, (ii) to disclose any information to the extent it
would cause a loss of privilege to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or

such information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such
jeopardy or contravention). All requests for information made pursuant to this

in which case, such party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the
circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other party to

investors or those attending industry conferences and make internal
announcements to employees so long as such statements are consistent with

promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and in compliance
with applicable Laws, Parent and the Company shall develop a joint plan for
communication to the Companys employees, independent contractors, customers,
suppliers and other strategic Persons about this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to making any written or
oral communications to the employees or independent contractors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit
matters that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication,
Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any
such mutually agreeable communication.

Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the fullest extent permitted
under Delaware law.

(b) As of the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation (with the
election being at Parents option) shall have purchased a tail policy to the

Company which tail policy shall be effective for a period from the Effective
Time through and including the date six years after the Closing Date (a "Tail
Policy") with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Effective Time, and which Tail Policy shall contain coverage
and amounts at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the coverage
currently provided by Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance policies (in the aggregate); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend, for the
entire Tail Policy, in excess of three times the annual premium currently paid
by the Company for such insurance; and, _provided_ , _further_ that, if the
premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy or policies with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other

or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation

Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

hereby, (b) any Actions commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of
its Subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the

(i) in the case of the Company, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) has materially impaired, or would
reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of such party (or, in
the case of Parent, Purchaser) to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, or (iii) would cause, or
would reasonably be expected to cause, the failure of any condition precedent
to the Companys or Parent and Purchasers obligations to consummate the Offer
and the Merger, in each case within three business days of an executive
officer of such party

 



49  becoming aware of the occurrence of such fact, event or circumstance. Each
such notification shall include a certification of an officer of the Company,
Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, that such notification is being delivered
in accordance with this Section 6.12. No such notification shall be deemed to
supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule for the purpose of (x)
determining the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by
the parties hereto in this Agreement, or (y) determining whether any of the

this Agreement by each officer or director of the Company who is subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to equity securities of the
Company.

Section 6.14 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) During the one year period following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide each employee
of the Company and any Subsidiary who continues to be employed by the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof (the "Continuing Employees")
with compensation (including, as applicable, base salary, bonus plans
(based on bonus opportunity rather than actual bonus payments), severance
benefits, other employee benefits (except for retention benefits), health and
welfare benefits and benefits under any plan intended to be qualified within
the meaning of section 401(a) of the Code ("401(k) Plan")) that is at least
substantially comparable in the aggregate to that provided to Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement. Nothing in
this Section 6.14 shall (i) create any right in any Continuing Employee to
continued employment by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary
thereof or (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary
thereof to continue any Company Benefit Plan or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination of any Company Benefit Plan after the Effective
Time. Nothing in this Section 6.14 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a right in any employee to employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation and
the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment,
subject to the terms and conditions of employment agreements, severance plans
and change of control plans.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing:

 

(i) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
and instruct its Subsidiaries to, as applicable, assume the liability for
such accrued personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Continuing
Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance
with the practice and policies of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries.

 



50 (ii) To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, benefit
accrual, vesting or allowances (including paid time off) under any severance,
health or welfare benefit plan or 401(k) Plan of Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation, then Parent shall ensure that such severance, health or welfare
benefit plan and 401(k) plan shall, for purposes of eligibility, benefit
accrual, vesting and allowances (including paid time off), credit Continuing
Employees for service with the Company prior to the Effective Time to the same
extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the
corresponding severance, health or welfare benefit plan or 401(k) Plan of the
Company. With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or
the Surviving Corporation made available to Continuing Employees in the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
there to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and
give effect, in determining any deductibles and maximum out of
pocket limitations, to claims incurred, amounts paid by, and amounts
reimbursed to, Continuing Employees under similar plans maintained by the
Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(iii) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to, honor, in accordance with its terms, each Company Benefit
Plan and all obligations thereunder, including any rights or benefits arising
as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
combination with any other event, including termination of
employment). Parent hereby agrees and acknowledges that the consummation of
the Merger constitutes a change of control or a change in control, as the case
may be, for all purposes under any plan, agreement or arrangement set forth in
Section 4.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(iv) With respect to the annual bonus for which any employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is eligible under any of the Companys annual
incentive plans with respect to any year, if any, prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall administer each such plan (including the payment of all
amounts owed thereunder at the ordinary time) in accordance with its terms
consistent with past practices in the ordinary course of business.

termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Offer and the Merger
pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement shall become void and of no
effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto (or of
any of its Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , and
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, that (i) no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages to
the other party hereto resulting from any

 



53  willful and material breach of this Agreement and (ii) the provisions set
forth in Section 6.10 (Expenses), this Section 8.5, Article IX and the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by (x) Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or (y) Parent
pursuant to Section 8.4(d) and in connection with either clause (x) or (y):

Acquisition Proposal or consummates a transaction contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal (provided that for purposes of this clause (B), the
references to "10%" and "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall
be deemed to be a reference to "50%") (any such agreement or consummation, an
"Acquisition Event"), in each case whether or not such Acquisition Proposal
is the same as the original Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (A)
above,

 

then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee within two business
days of consummation of such Acquisition Event;

 

(ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b), then the Company shall pay to
Parent the Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with such termination; or

(any termination contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), a "Termination
Fee Trigger"), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee within
two business days of such termination.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Termination Fee" shall mean $12,000,000. No
Acquisition Proposal made by a Person shall be deemed to have been "clearly
withdrawn," in the event that the Company later agrees within the 12-month
period specified in Section 8.5(b)(i)(B) to or consummates an Acquisition
Event with such Person or an Affiliate thereof. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, (x) in no event shall the Company be required
to pay the fee referred to in this Section 8.5(b) on more than one occasion
and (y) the parties hereto agree that the payment of the Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and Purchaser with
respect to this Agreement in the event any such payment becomes due and
payable and is paid, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee, the Company
(and the Companys Affiliates and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives) shall have no further
liability to Parent and Purchaser under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall not be relieved or released from any liabilities or
damages arising out of its willful and material breach of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that

 



54  the aggregate amount of any damages determined by a court to be payable by
the Company pursuant to the foregoing proviso shall be reduced by the amount
of any Termination Fee previously paid to Parent pursuant to this Section
8.5(b).

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section
8.5(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay
the Termination Fee and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Purchaser
commences a suit that results in a Judgment against the Company for the
Termination Fee (or a portion thereof), the Company shall pay Parent its costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate
published in the Money Rates section of The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made. All payments under Section
8.5(b) shall be made promptly by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by the party receiving such payment.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND

UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO

in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by such
party. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this

hereto), the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Support Agreement and the
letter agreement, dated September 18, 2014, between Parent and the Company
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, with respect to
the subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF PARENT,
PURCHASER NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND
EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE

AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE
DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY
DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE
FOREGOING.

 

Section 9.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.9
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance), Parent, Purchaser and
the Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other parties
hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and
this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right
to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties
hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under
Section 6.9 shall not arise unless and until the Acceptance Time occurs. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.3 without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 

Section 9.9 _Obligations of Parent and the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires Purchaser or another Affiliate of Parent to take any action, Parent
shall be liable for any failure of such Person to take such action. Whenever
this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective
Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action.

 



58 Section 9.10 _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined
in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

Section 9.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be
invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Entity declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent
possible.

Section 9.12 _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and
headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part
of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of
the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a
Section, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of, Annex to
or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of like import used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. Terms defined in the singular shall
also include the plural and vice versa. A reference in this Agreement to $ or
dollars is to U.S. dollars. 

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement.

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation
of law or otherwise;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Parent may designate,
by written notice to the Company, another of its Affiliates to be a
Constituent Corporation in lieu of Purchaser, in which event all references
herein to Purchaser shall be deemed references to such other Affiliate,
except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to
Purchaser as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and
warranties made with respect to such other Affiliate as of the date of such
designation and (b) Parent and Purchaser may assign all or any of their
respective rights and obligations hereunder to a lender as collateral, in each
case after providing written notice thereof to the Company prior to
such designation or assignment; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such
designation or assignment shall not materially impede or delay the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of the
stockholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in
violation of this Agreement is void.

 

Section 9.14 _JAB Obligation_. JAB Holdings BV, a Dutch _Besloten Vennootschap
met beperkte aansprakelijkheid_  ("JAB") hereby agrees to cause Parent to
perform

 



59  its payment obligations under this Agreement. JAB, the Company, Parent and

(iii) (x) (a) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in

contained in this Agreement other than those specified in the foregoing
clauses (a) and (b) (disregarding all qualifications and exceptions contained
therein regarding materiality or a Material Adverse Effect or any similar
standard or qualification), shall not be true and correct, except where the
failure of any such representation or warranty to be so true and correct
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, in the case of each of clauses (a), (b) and
(c), as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Acceptance Time as though
made on and as of such date (unless any such representation or warranty is
made only as of a specific date, in which event such representation or
warranty shall be true, complete and correct as of such specific date) or (y)
Parent shall not have received at the Acceptance Time a certificate signed on
behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company to the
effect that the conditions set forth in this clause (iii) have been satisfied;

 

(iv) the Company shall not have performed in all material respects all

B-1 (v) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any change,
state of facts, circumstance, event or development (including the incurrence

otherwise) that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is reasonably
likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect;

(vi) a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,

(viii) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

The foregoing conditions (except for the Minimum Tender Condition) may be
waived by Parent or Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time
to time, subject in each case to the terms of this Agreement.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser,

rise to the assertion of any such conditions and may be waived (to the extent
permitted by this Agreement and applicable Law) by Parent or Purchaser in

(except for the Minimum Tender Condition), in each case, subject to the terms
of the Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The

rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.
