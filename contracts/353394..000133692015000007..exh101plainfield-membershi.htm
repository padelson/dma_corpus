made without regard to materiality. The Independent Accountants shall only
decide the specific items under dispute by the Parties and their decision for
each Disputed Adjustment Amount must be within the range of values assigned to
each such item in the Preliminary Closing Statement and the Statement of
Adjustment Objections, respectively. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants shall be paid by Seller, on the one hand, and by Buyer, on the
other hand, based upon the percentage that the amount actually contested but
not awarded to Seller or Buyer, respectively, bears to the aggregate amount
actually contested by Seller and Buyer. The Independent Accountants shall make
a determination as soon as practicable within thirty (30) days (or such other
time as the Parties shall agree in writing) after their engagement, and their
resolution of the Disputed Adjustment Amounts and their adjustments, if any,
to the Preliminary Closing Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon
Seller and Buyer. For the sake of clarity, any amounts not disputed by Seller
pursuant to a timely delivered Statement of Adjustment Objections and any
amounts that were timely disputed by Seller but resolved by Buyer and Seller
pursuant to Section 2.4(c) shall not be subject to review by the Independent
Accountants.

(e) Final Closing Statement and Adjustments. As used in this Agreement, the
"Final Closing Statement" shall mean (i) the Preliminary Closing Statement if
no Statement 

of Adjustment Objections is delivered to Buyer during the Adjustment Review
Period, or (ii) the Preliminary Closing Statement, as adjusted by (A) the
written agreement of Seller and Buyer following discussions during the
Adjustment Resolution Period pursuant to Section 2.4(c) and/or (B) the
determination of any Disputed Adjustment Amounts by the Independent
Accountants in accordance with Section 2.4(d). Based on the Final Closing
Statement, the Closing Payment shall be adjusted as follows, with all of such
adjustments being combined into a single net adjustment to the Closing
Payment:

(i) if the actual Cash set forth in the Final Closing Statement exceeds the
estimated Cash included in the Estimated Net Adjustment Amount, the Closing
Payment shall be adjusted upwards by the amount of such excess, and if the
actual Cash set forth in the Final Closing Statement is less than the
estimated Cash included in the Estimated Net Adjustment Amount, the Closing
Payment shall be adjusted downwards by the amount of such shortfall;

(ii) if the actual Indebtedness set forth in the Final Closing Statement is
less than the estimated Indebtedness included in the Estimated Net Adjustment
Amount, the Closing Payment shall be adjusted upwards by the amount of such
shortfall, and if the actual Indebtedness set forth in the Final Closing
Statement exceeds the estimated Indebtedness included in the Estimated Net
Adjustment Amount, the Closing Payment shall be adjusted downwards by the
amount of such excess; and

(iii) if the actual Net Working Capital set forth in the Final Closing
Statement exceeds the estimated Net Working Capital included in the Estimated
Net Adjustment Amount, the Closing Payment shall be adjusted upwards by the
amount of such excess, and if the actual Net Working Capital set forth in the
Final Closing Statement is less than the estimated Net Working Capital
included in the Estimated Net Adjustment Amount, the Closing Payment shall be
adjusted downwards by the amount of such shortfall.

(f) Payment of Post-Closing Adjustment. Except as otherwise provided herein,
payment of any post-Closing adjustment to the Closing Payment determined
pursuant to Section 2.4(e), together with interest calculated as set forth
below, shall (i) be due within ten (10) Business Days of determination of the
Final Closing Statement, and (ii) be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account as is directed by Buyer or Seller, as the case
may be. The amount of any post-Closing adjustment to the Closing Payment shall
bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of
payment at a rate of three percent (3%) per annum, calculated daily on the
basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed until payment,
without compounding.

(g) Special Adjustment for Incomplete Capital Expenditures. To the extent any
capital expenditure item listed under Part B of Section 6.2(m) of the
Disclosure Schedules is not fully completed as of the Closing Date, the Target
Cash Amount shall be adjusted upwards by an amount equal to the estimated cost
to complete such capital expenditure item. Any such estimated cost to complete
an incomplete capital expenditure item shall be 

calculated by Seller and delivered to Buyer with the Estimated Closing
Statement, but shall be subject to Buyer's review and approval, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(h) Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Any payment made pursuant to this Section
2.4 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the Parties for
Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

Section 2.5 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the purchase and sale of the LRE Membership Interest contemplated hereby shall
take place at a closing (the "Closing") to be held at 10:00 a.m., Virginia
time, on the third (3rd) Business Day after the last of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article VI has been satisfied or waived (other than any
condition which, by its nature, is to be satisfied on the Closing Date)
(provided that if the last such condition to Closing has been satisfied or
waived within five (5) Business Days of the last day of a calendar month and
the Parties are able to effectuate the Closing on the last Business Day of
such calendar month, then the Closing shall occur on the last Business Day of
such calendar month) at the offices of Seller in Reston, Virginia, or at such
other time or on such other date or at such other place as Seller and Buyer
may mutually agree upon in writing (the day on which the Closing takes place
being the "Closing Date").

Section 2.6 Earn-Out. Subject to the provisions of this Section 2.6, following
the Closing, Seller shall be entitled to receive additional payments (each, an
"Earnout Payment") from PRE based on PRE's generation of Free Cash Flow in any
Earnout Year in excess of the applicable Annual Threshold Amount for such
Earnout Year. Any such Earnout Payment shall be determined and paid in
accordance with this Section 2.6.

(a) Earnout Payment Calculation. For each Earnout Year, the Earnout Payment
calculation shall be:

[30% x (FCF - ATA)] + SA

Where:

FCF = Free Cash Flow for such Earnout Year

ATA = Annual Threshold Amount for such Earnout Year

| 
---|--- 

SA

|

= Cumulative Shortfall Amount (if any) from the immediately preceding Earnout
Year. 

If such calculation produces a positive amount, such amount shall be the
amount of the Earnout Payment for such Earnout Year, and any prior existing
Shortfall Amount shall be extinguished. If such calculation produces a
negative amount, such amount shall become the then current Shortfall Amount.
PRE shall, and Buyer shall cause PRE to, pay Seller the Earnout Payment, if
any. Exhibit I sets forth a sample calculation of the Earnout Payment and
Shortfall Amount.

(b) Initial Determination and Review. Buyer shall cause to be prepared for
each Earnout Year audited financial statements of PRE, including a balance
sheet of PRE as of 

December 31 of such Earnout Year and the related statements of income, changes
in members' equity and cash flow for such Earnout Year. Within thirty (30)
days after PRE's or Buyer's receipt of such audited financial statements for
each Earnout Year, but in any event no later than ninety (90) days after the
end of each Earnout Year, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a copy of such audited
financial statements and, based thereon, PRE's calculation of (i) the Free
Cash Flow for such Earnout Year and (ii) any Earnout Payment due to Seller for
such Earnout Year (collectively, the "Earnout Statement"). Seller shall have
thirty (30) days (the "Earnout Review Period") from the date of delivery to it
of the Earnout Statement to review the Earnout Statement. During the Earnout
Review Period, Seller and Seller's accountants shall have reasonable access to
the books and records of PRE and, to the extent applicable, Buyer and to the
personnel of, and work papers prepared by, PRE and Buyer and/or their
accountants, in each case solely to the extent that such books, records,
personnel and work papers relate to the Earnout Statement, and Buyer shall
respond promptly to reasonable requests by Seller for documents or information
to the extent such documents and information are relevant to Seller's review
of the Earnout Statement; provided, however, that such access and requests by
Seller shall be during normal business hours and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of PRE or Buyer.

(c) Objection and Negotiated Resolution. On or prior to the last day of the
Earnout Review Period, Seller may object to the Earnout Statement, or any part
thereof, by delivering to Buyer a written statement setting forth Seller's
objections in reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and
the basis for Seller's disagreement therewith (the "Statement of Earnout
Objections"). If Seller fails to deliver the Statement of Earnout Objections
to Buyer before the expiration of the Earnout Review Period, the Earnout
Statement and the associated determination of the Earnout Amount, or the
determination that no Earnout Amount is due, shall be deemed to have been
accepted by Seller and shall be final and binding upon the Parties. If Seller
delivers the Statement of Earnout Objections to Buyer before the expiration of
the Earnout Review Period, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve Seller's objections within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the
Statement of Earnout Objections (the "Earnout Resolution Period"), and, if the
same are so resolved within the Earnout Resolution Period, the Earnout
Statement, as modified by the agreement of Seller and Buyer, and the
associated determination of the Earnout Amount (if any) shall be final and
binding upon the Parties.

(d) Dispute Resolution Process. If Seller and Buyer fail to reach an agreement
with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of Earnout
Objections before the expiration of the Earnout Resolution Period, then any
amount remaining in dispute ("Disputed Earnout Amounts") shall be submitted
for resolution to the Independent Accountants who, acting as experts and not
arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Earnout Amounts only and make any
related adjustments to the Earnout Statement. The Parties agree that all
adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. The Independent
Accountants shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the Parties
and their decision for each Disputed Earnout Amount must be within the range
of values assigned to each such item in the Earnout Statement and the
Statement of Earnout Objections, respectively. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountants shall be paid by Seller, 

on the one hand, and by Buyer, on the other hand, based upon the percentage
that the amount actually contested but not awarded to Seller or Buyer,
respectively, bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by Seller and
Buyer. The Independent Accountants shall make a determination as soon as
practicable within thirty (30) days (or such other time as the Parties shall
agree in writing) after their engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed
Earnout Amounts and their adjustments, if any, to the Earnout Statement shall
be conclusive and binding upon the Parties. For the sake of clarity, any
amounts not disputed by Seller pursuant to a timely delivered Statement of
Earnout Objections and any amounts that were timely disputed by Seller but
resolved by Buyer and Seller pursuant to Section 2.6(c) shall not be subject
to review by the Independent Accountants.

(e) Payment. PRE shall pay, and Buyer shall cause PRE to pay, any Earnout
Payment due to Seller within thirty (30) days after final determination of
such Earnout Payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.6,
such payment to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such bank account as is directed by Seller by written notice to Buyer.
Commencing on the first day after such thirty (30)-day period, any such
Earnout Payment, to the extent unpaid, shall bear interest at the rate of
three percent (3%) per annum, calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day year
and the actual number of days elapsed until payment, without compounding.

(f) Cap on Earnout Payments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 2.6
to the contrary, the aggregate amount of Earnout Payments payable to Seller
(exclusive of interest, as applicable) shall not exceed $25,000,000.

(g) Prepayment. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 2.6 to the
contrary, Buyer may elect in its sole discretion, by written notice to Seller
(a "Prepayment Notice"), to pay Seller a one-time cash payment (a
"Prepayment") in full satisfaction of Buyer's obligations under this Section
2.6 with respect to any future Earnout Payments; provided, however, that such
Prepayment shall not relieve PRE and Buyer of their obligations under this
Section 2.6 with respect to any Earnout Payment for any Earnout Year that has
ended prior to the date of delivery to Seller of the Prepayment Notice. The
amount of such Prepayment, if elected by Buyer, shall be determined as
follows: (i) if the Prepayment Notice is delivered to Seller after the Closing
Date and before the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Prepayment
shall be $8,125,000; (ii) if the Prepayment Notice is delivered to Seller on
or after the second anniversary of the Closing Date and before the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Prepayment shall be $7,875,000; (iii) if
the Prepayment Notice is delivered to Seller on or after the third anniversary
of the Closing Date and before the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Prepayment shall be $7,500,000; and (iv) if the Prepayment Notice is delivered
to Seller on or after the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Prepayment shall be $7,250,000. Any Prepayment shall be due and payable to
Seller within thirty (30) days after the Prepayment Notice is delivered to
Seller, following which the amount of such Prepayment shall bear interest at a
rate of three percent (3%) per annum, calculated daily on the basis of a
365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding. 

(h) Lender Restrictions on Payment.

(i) If Buyer or PRE repays all or any part of the Note through refinancing
with one or more arm's-length commercial lenders, then Buyer and Seller
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of the loan agreements for such
refinancing (the "Loan Agreements") shall be permitted to include reasonable
and customary restrictions on the payment of any Earnout Amount or Prepayment
when due. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts in negotiating any such Loan Agreement to avoid lender
restrictions on the payment of any Earnout Payment or Prepayment when Buyer is
not in default under such Loan Agreement. If, pursuant to the provisions of
any Loan Agreement, Buyer or PRE is prohibited from paying any Earnout Amount
or Prepayment when due, then, then subject to the provisions of Section
2.6(h)(ii), such Earnout Amount or Prepayment shall accrue interest from such
due date until the date on which such Earnout Amount or Prepayment is paid at
a rate of eight percent (8%) per annum, calculated daily on the basis of a
365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding.

(ii) If, PRE has delivered a Prepayment Notice to Seller but, pursuant to the
provisions of any Loan Agreement, PRE is prohibited from paying any Prepayment
when due, then Seller may elect in its sole discretion, by written notice
delivered to Buyer within fifteen (15) days after the later of (i) Seller's
receipt of such Prepayment Notice or (ii) Seller's first receipt of written
notice that such Prepayment cannot be made due to restrictions under any Loan
Agreement, to void Buyer's Prepayment election under such Prepayment Notice.
In such event, the provisions of this Section 2.6 shall continue to apply to
all applicable Earnout Years as if such Prepayment Notice had never been given
by PRE, and, unless otherwise agreed by Seller in writing, PRE may not further
elect under Section 2.6(g) to make a Prepayment until such time as PRE is no
longer prohibited under the Loan Documents from actually paying such
Prepayment.

(i) Obligations Survive Sale of Facility. Following the Closing, any direct or
indirect sale, transfer, assignment or other disposition of the Facility,
whether by sale of Assets or sale of Ownership Interests (whether by direct
sale, merger, reorganization or other form of transaction), other than any
foreclosure or similar action by Parent under the Security Agreement, the
Pledge Agreement or the Mortgage, shall not relieve Buyer of its obligations
under this Section 2.6 unless the acquirer of such Assets or Ownership
Interests agrees in writing with Seller (in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Seller) to assume and fully discharge such obligations.

(j) Termination of Obligations. Buyer's obligations under this Section 2.6
shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) Seller having been paid an
aggregate of $25,000,000 in Earnout Payments (exclusive of interest, as
applicable), (ii) Buyer having paid to Seller the applicable Prepayment
(including any accrued interest thereon, as applicable), or (iii) Buyer having
satisfied its Earnout Payment obligations under this Section 2.6 with respect
to all Earnout Years. 

(k) Assignment of Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, Seller may at any time assign its rights under this Section 2.6
to one or more of its Affiliates.

Section 2.7 Purchase Price Allocation.

(a) Buyer and Seller shall negotiate with a view to completing no later than
the Closing Date the drafting of a schedule that allocates the Base Price and
the liabilities of the Acquired Companies that are considered assumed for
federal income tax purposes (plus other relevant items) among the Assets of
the Acquired Companies. Following the Closing Date, in the event of an
adjustment to the Base Price pursuant to Section 2.4 or the payment of any
Earnout Payment pursuant to Section 2.6, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate with
a view to completing (within thirty (30) days after the date of such
adjustment or payment) the drafting of a revised schedule that allocates such
adjustment or payment, together with any prior allocation determined pursuant
to this Section 2.7 among the Assets of the Acquired Companies. Any allocation
schedule described above in this Section 2.7(a) shall be reasonable and shall
be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. Buyer and Seller
shall endeavor in good faith to resolve any disagreement in connection with
the negotiation and drafting of any allocation schedule contemplated by this
Section 2.7(a).

(b) If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement as to
allocations by the expiration of the applicable target date or time noted in
Section 2.7(a), and do not agree to extend the period for such negotiated
determination of the allocation in question, then they shall submit the open
allocation issue(s) to the Independent Accountants who, acting as experts and
not arbitrators, shall examine each of Buyer's and Seller's proposed
allocation(s), including reasons therefor and any relevant backup
documentation provided in respect thereof, and shall determine the
allocation(s) to be made. The Independent Accountants shall only decide the
specific allocation items under dispute and their decision for each allocation
item must be within the range of values assigned to each such item in the
respective submissions of Buyer and Seller. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountants shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer. The
Independent Accountants shall make a determination as soon as practicable
within thirty (30) days (or such other time as Buyer and Seller shall agree in
writing) after their engagement under this Section 2.7(b), and their
determination of the allocation(s) in question shall be conclusive and binding
upon Seller and Buyer. For the sake of clarity, any allocation item not
disputed by Buyer or Seller shall not be subject to review or determination by
the Independent Accountants.

(c) The Parties (as applicable) agree to file their respective applicable Tax
Returns, reports, and forms, including IRS Form 8594, in a manner consistent
with the Purchase Price allocation (including any amendment thereto) as
determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.7,
and no Party shall (i) take any position in any Tax Return, report, or form,
including any amendment thereto, or (ii) reach any settlement or agreement in
respect of any audit which is inconsistent with such allocation unless such
inconsistency is mandated by applicable Law. If such inconsistency is mandated
by applicable Law, the Party taking such position shall provide prompt written
notice to 

each other Party of such inconsistency and its effect on the Parties' agreed
upon allocation of the Purchase Price.

Section 2.8 Determination of PIK Interest Deferral Amount for Credit
Agreement. For purposes of Sections 2.03 and 2.04 of the Credit Agreement, the
amount of PIK Interest (as that term is defined in the Credit Agreement) whose
payment may be deferred by PRE from the payment due twelve (12) months after
the date of the Credit Agreement to the payment due eighteen (18) months after
the date of the Credit Agreement shall be determined as follows based on the
original principal amount of the Note, as determined pursuant to Section
2.3(a)(ii):

If Note Principal Amount Is: PIK Interest Deferral Amount is:

$81,000,000 or greater $1,000,000

$80,000,000 to $80,999,999.99 $1,200,000

$79,000,000 to $79,999,999.99 $1,400,000

$78,000,000 to $78,999,999.99 $1,700,000

Less than $78,000,000 $2,000,000

attorney-client or other privilege; or (z) contravene any applicable Law,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. In addition, Seller shall provide Buyer for the period commencing
on the date of this Agreement until the Closing or the earlier termination of
this Agreement with a conference room, cubicles or other suitable space

its Representatives to, abide by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
with respect to any access or information provided pursuant to this Section
5.2. From the date hereof until the Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer with

copies of all notices, financial statements, reports, and other material
correspondence or items delivered to any counterparty under any Material
Contract.

Closing, Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to supplement or
amend the Disclosure Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising or
of which it becomes aware after the date hereof (each a "Schedule

indemnification or termination rights contained in this Agreement or of
determining whether or not the conditions set forth in Section 6.2 have been
satisfied.

Section 5.4 Resignations. Seller shall deliver to Buyer written resignations

provisions of NDA, information provided to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.
Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the NDA shall terminate with
respect to confidential information relating solely to the Acquired Companies;
provided, however, from and after the Closing Seller will hold, and will cause
its Affiliates and Representatives to hold, in strict confidence from any
other Person all information and documents relating to the Facility and the

available other than as a result of Seller's breach of this Section 5.5, (ii)
that is required to be disclosed pursuant to applicable Law or Governmental
Order, or (iii) whose disclosure is reasonably necessary for Seller to
exercise its rights or perform its covenants and obligations under this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the NDA and the provisions of the
first sentence of this Section 5.5 shall nonetheless continue in full force
and effect.

reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals from all Governmental Authorities that

delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement. Each Party shall cooperate fully with each other Party and its
Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals. The Parties shall not willfully take any action that
will have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any
required consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. If required by the
HSR Act and if the appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act has not been
filed prior to the date hereof, each Party agrees to make an appropriate
filing pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated

between Seller or the Acquired Companies with Governmental Authorities in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, any disclosure
which is not permitted by Law or any disclosure containing confidential

advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it being the intent that the
Parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good
faith the views of one another, in connection with any such analyses,

arguments, and proposals. Each Party shall give reasonable advance notice to
each other Party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or

Contest in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other
document received from any Governmental Authority in respect of any such
asserted Tax Contest.

(ii) In the case of a Tax Contest that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
of any Acquired Company, Seller shall have the sole right, at its expense, to
direct and control, through counsel of its own choosing, the conduct of such
Tax Contest. If Seller elects to direct and control any such Tax Contest,
Seller shall within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice of the Tax
Contest notify Buyer of its intent to do so, and Buyer shall cooperate and
shall cause each Acquired Company (as applicable) to fully cooperate, at
Seller's expense, in each phase of such Tax Contest. If Seller elects not to
control the conduct of such Tax Contest, Buyer or any Acquired Company (as
applicable) may assume control of such Tax Contest, at Buyer's sole expense.
However, in such case, (A) Seller shall have the right to participate jointly
(but not control) with Buyer at its sole cost and expense in the conduct of
such Tax Contest, (B) in any event, Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably
informed with respect to the conduct of such Tax Contest, including providing

notice of the Tax Contest notify Buyer of its intent to do so, and Buyer shall
cooperate and shall cause each Acquired Company (as applicable) to fully
cooperate, at Seller's expense, in each phase of such Tax Contest. If Seller
elects not to direct such Tax Contest, Buyer or any Acquired Company (as
applicable) may assume control of such Tax Contest, at Buyer's sole expense.
However, in such case, neither Buyer nor any Acquired Company may settle or
compromise any asserted liability without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In any event,
Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed with respect to the conduct of
such Tax Contest, including providing copies of any correspondence with the
applicable Governmental Authority, and Seller may participate, at its own
expense, in the Tax Contest. 

(h) Cooperation and Exchange of Information. Seller and Buyer shall provide
each other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably
may request of the other in filing any Tax Return pursuant to this Section

shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof,
together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax authorities.

(i) Conduct Affecting Pre-Closing Taxes. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law or with the written consent of Seller, Buyer covenants and
agrees that it shall not, nor shall it cause any Acquired Company or any other
Affiliate to, file any claim for a Tax refund, change any method of Tax
accounting, settle or compromise any federal, state, local or foreign Tax
liability regarding any Acquired Company, or make or change any Tax election
with respect to any Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or for any
Straddle Tax Period, in each case that may result in any increased Tax
liability of, or loss of Tax benefits or attributes by, Seller or by any
Acquired Company in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or for the portion
of any Straddle Tax Period for which Seller is liable for Taxes pursuant to
Section 5.12(b).

(j) State Tax Credits. If any State of Connecticut Tax credits are awarded to
any of the Acquired Companies prior to Closing, no such tax credits will be
used, transferred or sold by such Acquired Company before Closing and shall be
solely for the account of the Acquired Companies and, subject to completion of
the Closing, Buyer.

transfer the LRE Membership Interest, the PRE Holdings Membership Interest,

Membership Interest, the PRE Holdings Membership Interest, the PRE Membership
Interest, or the Facility to be assigned or transferred, directly or
indirectly to any Person other than a Qualified Person;

(iii) Buyer shall not, nor shall Buyer cause or permit any Acquired Company or
any direct or indirect assignee or transferee of the LRE Membership Interest,
the PRE Holdings Membership Interest, the PRE Membership Interest, or the
Facility to, become a Person other than a Qualified Person;

(iv) Buyer shall cause any transferee or assignee of the Facility permitted
under this Section 5.13 to enter into a written agreement to be jointly liable
with PRE for any Recapture Event; and 

(v) any transfer or assignment of a direct or indirect interest in any Person
or in the Facility in violation of this Section 5.13 shall be void ab initio
and have no force or effect.

(l) During the portion of the Recapture Period that follows the Closing Date,
for as long as the Facility is operated during such period of time, Buyer
shall, and shall cause each Acquired Company and any direct or indirect
assignee or transferee of the LRE Membership Interest, the PRE Holdings
Membership Interest, the PRE Membership Interest, or the Facility to, operate
the Facility as an "open-loop biomass" facility in accordance with Section
1603 of the ARRA and related Treasury guidance, with no less than 100% of the
electricity being produced from biomass (other than auxiliary fuel for start-
up and stabilization) as described in Section 1603 of the ARRA and related
Treasury guidance.

such reports. During the portion of the Recapture Period that follows the
Closing Date, Buyer agrees that any owner (including an owner for purposes of
the ARRA and/or federal income Tax) of the Facility for Federal income tax
purposes shall be at all times a Qualified Person. During the portion of the
Recapture Period that follows the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Seller in
writing of any assignment or transfer of a direct or indirect interest in
Buyer, PRE, PRE Holdings or LRE (other than an interest that is owned entirely
through a Higher Tier Owner), or any assignment or transfer of the Facility,
within five (5) Business Days after its occurrence, which notice shall include
reasonable details thereof so as to permit Seller to confirm that such
assignment or transfer would not trigger a Recapture Event. During the portion
of the Recapture Period that follows the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) cause
PRE to remain an entity disregarded as being separate from its owner for
federal income Tax purposes, and (ii) not cause or permit PRE to be dissolved,
liquidated, wound up or terminated (provided that such prohibition shall not
restrict the change of PRE's domicile to a different U.S. state so long as
such change does not entail the termination of PRE as a legal entity).

(n) For purposes of this Section 5.13, (i) any interest in an entity (which
includes the LRE Membership Interest, the PRE Holdings Membership Interest and
the PRE Membership Interest) or property shall be interpreted broadly and
shall include any portion of such interest and include an equity or profits
interest, (ii) any assignment or transfer shall be interpreted broadly and
shall include any assignment, transfer or other disposition for ARRA or
federal income Tax purposes (including the entering into a lease that is
treated as a disposition, such as a capital lease), and (iii) the terms
assignee and transferee shall be interpreted broadly and shall include any
actual, nominal, or beneficial holder.

VII, including any limitations contained therein, Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Tax
liabilities or other Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, any
Seller Indemnified Party based upon or arising out 

of any breach by Buyer of any of its covenants, representations or warranties
in the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.13.

Section 5.14 Casualty.

loss or other event or circumstance during the Interim Period (a "Casualty

following such event, notice thereof and, to the extent reasonably possible

(b) If the Restoration Cost does not exceed $11,250,000, prior to Closing,
Seller shall, or shall cause PRE to, in either case at Seller's sole cost and
expense, repair such Casualty Loss to bring the Facility to a condition
reasonably comparable to its prior condition consistent with Good Industry
Practices. There shall be no reduction in the amount of the Purchase Price in
respect thereof.

(c) If the Restoration Cost is greater than $11,250,000, (a "Major Casualty
Loss"), within sixty (60) days after the date of the occurrence of such
Material Casualty Loss, Buyer may elect, by written notice to Seller, to
terminate this Agreement without further liability to any Party hereunder;
provided, that if such sixty (60) day period extends beyond the Drop Dead
Date, then the Drop Dead Date may be extended by Buyer until the end of such
sixty (60) day period.

(d) Repairs to be conducted by Seller or PRE to remedy a Casualty Loss
pursuant to Section 5.14(b) shall not extend the Drop Dead Date as long as

or Buyer's election and written notice to the other, the Drop Dead Date may be
extended by up to thirty (30) days to permit the completion of such repairs.

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.14 shall limit any of Buyer's remedies under
this Agreement to the extent that a Casualty Loss has had or could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(f) In the case of Section 5.14(b), (i) any insurance proceeds obtained by
Seller or any Acquired Company, either before or after Closing, in respect of
such Material Casualty Loss shall be for the sole account of Seller and shall
not be taken into account in the calculation of the Net Adjustment Amount;
(ii) following the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause PRE to, cooperate
reasonably with Seller with respect to the pursuit of any insurance claim of
any Acquired Company with respect to such Casualty Loss; (iii) such
cooperation shall include any insurance claim that is pending as of the

Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date; provided, however, that any Tax
liability, or portion thereof (including any Recapture Event contemplated by
Section 5.13), shall not constitute a liability of Seller under this Section
7.2(d) to the extent the same is caused by Buyer's breach of any provision of
Section 5.13.

Section 7.3 Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article VII, Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates (which would include, following any foreclosure by Seller under the
Pledge Agreement, PRE) and Representatives, and all heirs, executors, personal
representatives, successors and assigns of the foregoing (collectively, the
"Seller Indemnified Parties") against, and shall hold the Seller Indemnified
Parties harmless from and against, any and all Losses incurred or sustained
by, or imposed upon, any Seller Indemnified Party based upon, arising out of,
with respect to or by reason of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Buyer contained in this Agreement; or

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 7.4 Certain Limitations. The Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party making a claim under this Article VII is referred to as the
"Indemnified Party," and the Party against whom such claims are asserted under
this Article VII is referred to as the "Indemnifying 

Party". The indemnification provided for in Section 7.2 and Section 7.3 shall
be subject to the following limitations:

(ff) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
indemnification under Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.3(a), as the case may be,
(i) until the aggregate amount of all Losses for which indemnification is
sought under Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.3(a) exceeds an amount equal to zero
point seven five percent (0.75%) of the Base Price, as finally adjusted in
accordance with Section 2.4, (the "Deductible"), at which time the
Indemnifying Party shall only be liable for indemnification under Section
7.2(a) or Section 7.3(a) for Losses in excess of the Deductible.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible shall not apply to any claim for
indemnification under Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.3(a) with respect to fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct, and to any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representation or warranty contained in the Seller Specified
Representations, the Buyer Specified Representations or the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.15, as applicable.

(gg) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which an Indemnifying Party shall
be liable pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.3(a) as the case may be,
shall not exceed an amount equal to twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) of the
Base Price, as finally adjusted in accordance with Section 2.4; provided,
however, that such limitation shall not apply to any claim for indemnification
under Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.3(a) with respect to fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct, and to any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty contained in the Seller Specified
Representations or the Buyer Specified Representations, as applicable.

(hh) The aggregate amount of all Losses for Special Indemnification Matters
for which Seller shall be liable pursuant to Section 7.2(c) shall not exceed
an amount equal to $35,000,000.

(ii) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 7.2 or Section 7.3
in respect of any Losses shall be limited to the net amount of any Losses that
remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds (net of any costs of
collection, deductible, retroactive premium adjustment, reasonably foreseeable
premium increases, reimbursement obligation or other out-of-pocket costs
directly related to the insurance claim in respect of Losses) and/or any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment (net of any costs or
expenses) actually received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
from any Person other than the Indemnifying Party with respect to the matter
in respect of which the indemnification claim under Section 7.2 or Section 7.3
was made. The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to recover under insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other
similar agreements for any Losses. To the extent a Buyer Indemnified Party
receives any such net insurance proceeds or any such indemnity, contribution
or other similar payment from any Person other than Seller after Seller has
satisfied its indemnification obligations under Section 7.2 with respect to a
claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party, Buyer shall, or shall cause such Buyer
Indemnified Party (if not Buyer) to, pay to Seller an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) the full amount of the indemnification payment made by the Buyer
Indemnified Party in respect of such claim or (ii) the full amount 

of such net insurance proceeds and/or such indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment received by such Buyer Indemnified Party or Affiliate thereof.
To the extent a Seller Indemnified Party receives any such net insurance
proceeds or any such indemnity, contribution or other similar payment from any
Person other than Buyer after Buyer has satisfied its indemnification
obligations under Section 7.2 with respect to a claim by a Seller Indemnified
Party, Seller shall, or shall cause such Seller Indemnified Party (if not
Seller) to, pay to Buyer an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the full amount
of the indemnification payment made by the Seller Indemnified Party in respect
of such claim or (ii) the full amount of such net insurance proceeds and/or
such indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by such Seller
Indemnified Party or Affiliate thereof.

(jj) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect
damages; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to Claims
brought by any third party.

(kk) Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses.

(ll) Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, (i) Seller
shall have no right to seek contribution from any Acquired Company with
respect to all or any part of any of the Seller's indemnification obligations
under this Article VII, and (ii) for the purpose of determining the amount of
the Losses resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of a representation,
warranty, or covenant of Buyer or Seller, any "materiality" or "Material
Adverse Effect" qualifiers or words of similar import contained in such
representation, warranty or covenant giving rise to the claim of indemnity
hereunder shall in each case be disregarded and without effect (as if such
standard or qualification were deleted from such representation or warranty).

(mm) The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made herein,
together with the indemnification provisions herein, are intended among other
things to allocate the economic cost and the risks inherent in the
transactions contemplated hereby between the Parties and, accordingly, a Party
shall be entitled to the indemnification or other remedies provided in this
Agreement by reason of any breach of any such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement by another Party notwithstanding whether any employee,
representative or agent of the Party seeking to enforce a remedy knew or had
reason to know of such breach.

(nn) Payments due to Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Article VII may be
accomplished in whole or in part, at the option of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, by the Buyer Indemnified Parties setting off any amount owed to
Seller or its Affiliates by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) under this Agreement, but excluding any amount owing by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) under the Credit
Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage, the Pledge Agreement or the Security
Agreement. To the extent setoff is made by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in
satisfaction or partial satisfaction of an indemnity obligation under this
Article VII that is disputed by Seller, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
place the disputed set off amount into an escrow 

account with a nationally recognized escrow agent pursuant to an escrow
agreement agreed by the Parties and upon settlement of the applicable claim or
claims or a subsequent determination by judgment, as applicable, that all or a
portion of such indemnity obligation was not owed to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall cause such escrow agent to pay
Seller the amount that was set off and not owed together with interest from
the date of setoff until the date of such payment.

Section 7.5 Indemnification Procedures.

(n) Third-Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding
made or brought by any Person who is not a Party or an Affiliate of a Party or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third-Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. Such notice by
the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent practicable, describe the Third-
Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any
Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's cost and expense and by the
Indemnifying Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in
good faith in such defense; provided that such Claim does not involve (i) a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party or its selected counsel,
on the one hand, and the Indemnified Party, on the other hand, (ii) any
defenses that the Indemnified Party could make in good faith that the
Indemnifying Party could not make in good faith or otherwise under applicable
Law or rules of professional conduct, (iii) any request by the Third Party for
an injunction (whether temporary or permanent) or other remedy in equity which
if successful could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the business,
assets or operations of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies). In the event that the Indemnifying Party is permitted to assume
the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to Section 7.5(b), it shall have
the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend,
appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the
name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have
the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of any
Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Party's right to control the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects
not to compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim or fails to promptly notify
the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 7.5(b), pay,
compromise, defend such Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and
all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third-Party Claim.
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in
connection with the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including making
available (subject to the provisions of Section 5.5) 

records relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing, without expense
(other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses) to the
defending Party, management employees of the non-defending Party as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third-Party
Claim.

(o) Settlement of Third-Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
provided in this Section 7.5(b). If a firm offer is made to settle a Third-
Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or
other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in
customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from
all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third-Party Claim and
the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within ten
(10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may continue
to contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and in such event, the maximum
liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third-Party Claim shall not
exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to
consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third-Party Claim upon the
terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third-Party Claim. If the
Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 7.5(a), it shall
not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(p) Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct
Claim in reasonable detail the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after
its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such thirty-day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

Section 7.6 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

Section 7.7 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 9.11 and except for fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
claims for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation set forth herein, and any and all claims relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this Article VII. In furtherance of the foregoing and except for
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful 

misconduct, each Party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under
Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein,
and any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it may
have against the other Parties and their Affiliates and each of their
respective Representatives arising under or based upon any Law, including any
Environmental Laws, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article VII. Nothing in this Section 7.7 shall limit any
Person's right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person
shall be entitled pursuant to Section 9.11.

Section 7.8 Special Indemnification Procedures.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in Sections 7.5(a) or Section 7.5(b) to the
contrary, Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall manage all Claims and Losses
relating to Special Indemnification Matters ("Special Indemnification Work").
Buyer will take all such actions as it determines are reasonably necessary to
resolve the Special Indemnification Work, including but not limited to filing
or amending Permit applications, installing additional equipment, negotiating
and entering into settlement or other binding agreements, and reporting,
investigating, remediating, and correcting circumstances and conditions;
provided, however, that any such settlement or other agreement for which
Seller shall have indemnification liability under this Article VII shall be
subject to Seller's prior written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(b) Buyer will keep Seller apprised of the progress and performance of the
Special Indemnification Work, and will promptly provide Seller with copies of
all draft and final environmental reports, studies, surveys, test data and
reports, assessments, cost estimates, correspondence (either received by, or
generated on behalf of, the Buyer) and all other information available to it
relating to the Special Indemnification Work. Buyer will provide Seller with
five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to review and comment in advance
on any work plans, investigations and other environmental remediation
activities, and shall incorporate all reasonable comments of Seller in such
final submissions.

(c) Buyer will permit Seller to attend pre-scheduled phone calls and meetings
with Governmental Authorities or other third parties, and to visit and inspect
the property, in a manner that will not cause unreasonable interference with
the Buyer's operations.

by the Drop Dead Date; or

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 shall not

part of, this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim
herein.

Section 9.4 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only
and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 9.5 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in

Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that

waiving. No waiver by any Party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in
respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such
written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether
occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement
shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege.

forth herein with respect to such Party. No past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of any Party or of any
Affiliate of any Party, or any of their successors or permitted assigns, shall
have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of any Party under this
Agreement or for any claim or action based on, in respect of or by reason of
the transactions contemplated hereby.
