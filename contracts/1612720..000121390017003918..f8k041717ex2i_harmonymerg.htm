NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the Parties agree as follows:

  



  

Article I 
  
  _BLOCKER RESTRUCTURING AND MERGERS_

  



  

1.1 _Indirect Blocker Restructuring_. Prior to the Blocker Effective
Time (as defined below) the Halcyon Blocker Manager and the general partner
of Blocker Five shall have caused the Indirect Blocker Restructuring, as
defined on _Schedule B_ attached hereto, to have been completed.

  



  

1.2 _Blocker Mergers_. At the Blocker Effective Time, and subject to
and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and subject to the
applicable provisions of the DGCL, the DLLCA and the DRUPA, each Blocker
Company shall be merged with and into Parent, the separate limited liability
company or limited partnership existence, as applicable, of each Blocker
Company shall cease and Parent shall be the surviving corporation in each
such Blocker Merger. Parent as the surviving corporation after the Blocker
Mergers is hereinafter in this _Article I_ also referred to as the " _Blocker
Surviving Corporation._ "

  



  

1.3 _Blocker Effective Time_. Subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Parties hereto shall cause the
Blocker Mergers to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "
_Blocker Companies Certificate of Merger_ ") in respect of the Blocker
Mergers with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, the DLLCA and the DRUPA (the time
of such filing, or such later time as specified in the Blocker Companies
Certificate of Merger in respect of the Blocker Mergers being the " _Blocker
Effective Time_ ").

  



  

1.4 _Effect of the Blocker Mergers_. At the Blocker Effective Time,
Parent shall continue in existence as the Blocker Surviving Corporation and,
without further transfer, succeed to and possess all rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of each Blocker Company, and all of the assets and
property of whatever kind and character of each Blocker Company shall vest in
Parent, as the Blocker Surviving Corporation, without further deed;
thereafter, Parent, as the Blocker Surviving Corporation, shall be liable for
all of the liabilities and obligations of each of the Blocker Companies, and
any claim or judgment against any of the respective Blocker Companies may be
enforced against Parent as the Blocker Surviving Corporation in accordance
with Section 259 of the DGCL.

  



  

1.5 _Governing Documents_. From and after the Blocker Effective Time,
(i) the Certificate of Incorporation of Parent shall be amended and restated
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ and (ii) the Bylaws of Parent
shall be amended and restated in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_.

  



  

1.6 _Directors and_ Officers. From and after the Blocker Effective
Time, the officers and directors of the Blocker Surviving Corporation
shall be as set forth on _Schedule 7.1(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

1.7 _Effect on Securities_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Blocker Effective Time, by virtue of the Blocker Mergers
and this Agreement and without any further action on the part of Parent, the
Blocker Owners or the holders of any of the securities of Parent, the
following shall occur:

  



  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(a) _Conversion of Blocker Membership Interests_.

  



  

(i) All of the outstanding Blocker Membership Interests immediately
prior to the Blocker Effective Time, will be automatically cancelled and
extinguished and be converted, collectively, into the right to receive (A) at
Closing, subject to _Section 2.8_, the Blocker Shares, and (B) the Blocker
Contingent Shares.

  



  

(ii) The Blocker Shares and the Blocker Contingent Shares shall be paid
to the Blocker Owners in the respective proportions set forth on  _Schedule
2.5(a)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(b) _No Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock will be issued by virtue of the Blocker Mergers or the
Transactions, and each Blocker Owner who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such Blocker
Owner) shall receive from Parent, in lieu of such fractional share, one (1)
share of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(c) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that each Blocker Owner is entitled to receive as a
result of the Blocker Mergers and as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement
shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into shares of Parent Common Stock), extraordinary
cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof until the Blocker
Effective Time.

  



  

(d) _Transfer of Ownership_. All securities issued upon the surrender
of securities of a Blocker Company in accordance with the terms hereof, shall
be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such securities.

  



  

1.8 _Issuance of Parent Common Stock_. At the Blocker Effective Time,
upon delivery of a Member/Blocker Owner Acknowledgment Agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_, Parent shall
issue, or cause to be issued, to each Blocker Owner the number of Blocker
Shares to which such holder is entitled as set forth on _Schedule
2.5(a)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, in book-entry form (to the
extent possible), for which their Blocker Membership Interests are
exchangeable at the Blocker Effective Time, as adjusted pursuant to _Section
1.7(b)_ and _Section 1.7(c)_, less such Blocker Owner's proportionate share
of the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the escrow as provided in
_Section 2.8_ below.

  



  

1.9 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the Parties hereto that (i)
each of the Blocker Mergers shall constitute a tax-free reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the regulations thereunder and
(ii) the Merger together with the Blocker Mergers shall constitute a tax-free
transaction pursuant to Section 351(a) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder, and in each case none of the Parties hereto shall take any
position to the contrary on any Tax return.

  



  

   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

1.10 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after
the Blocker Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest Parent, as applicable,
with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of each of the Blocker Companies, each of
the Blocker Owners or the Blocker Managers, as applicable, is fully
authorized in the name of its respective Blocker Company or otherwise to
take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such
action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

  



  

1.11 _Blocker Four Merger Condition_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, the merger of
Blocker Four with and into Parent (the " _Blocker Four Merger_ ") shall only
occur if, no less than five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, the Halcyon
Blocker Manager delivers to Parent a joinder to the Blocker Side Letter
executed by each of the Blocker Four Owners (the " _Blocker Four Merger
Condition_ ").

  



  

(b) So long as the Blocker Four Merger Condition has not been
satisfied:

  



  

(i) all references in this Agreement to (A) the "Blocker Companies"
shall exclude Blocker Four, (B) the "Blocker Entities" shall exclude Blocker
Four, (C) the "Blocker Mergers" shall exclude the Blocker Four Merger and (D)
the "Blocker Owners" shall exclude the Blocker Owners of Blocker Four listed
on _Schedule 3.3_ of the Blocker Disclosure Schedule; and

  



  

(ii) the Indirect Blocker Restructuring shall be as set forth on
Schedule B-1 attached hereto.

  



  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, if the Blocker Four Merger Condition is
not satisfied, as of immediately prior to the Closing, the Blocker Aggregator

(a) _Conversion of the Company Membership Interests_.

  



  

(i) All of the Company Membership Interests issued, outstanding and
vested immediately prior to the Effective Time or issued and

will be automatically cancelled and extinguished and be
converted, collectively, into the right to receive (A) at Closing, subject to
_Section 2.8_, the Company Shares, and (B) the Company Contingent Shares.

  



  

(ii) All issued Company Membership Interests under the Company's
Incentive Plan (" _MIP_ ") that, absent this _Section 2.5(a)(ii)_, would
otherwise be unvested immediately following the Effective Time, will be
automatically cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right to
receive (A) at Closing, an economically-equivalent number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Restricted Closing Shares_ ") and (B) following the
Closing and continuing for so long as any Restricted Shares remain subject to
the transfer and forfeiture restrictions set forth below and subject to
applicable securities laws and stock exchange rules, in the event that any
additional shares of Parent Common Stock are issued, an additional number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Restricted Post-Closing Shares_ ", and
together with the Restricted Closing Shares, the " _Restricted Shares_ "; the
Restricted Shares, together with the Closing Shares and the Contingent
Shares, the " _Merger Consideration_ ") such that, following such issuance,
the percentage of Parent Common Stock held by each holder of Restricted
Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.5(a)(ii)_ remains unchanged, in each case
that are subject to transfer and forfeiture restrictions that are
substantially similar to the transfer and forfeiture restrictions as were

of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such Member) shall receive
from Parent, in lieu of such fractional share, one (1) share of Parent Common
Stock.

  



  

(c) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The numbers of shares of
Parent Common Stock that the Members are entitled to receive as a result of
the Merger and as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement shall be adjusted
to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into shares of Parent Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividend,

shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock occurring on

each holder of the Company Membership Interests the number of Company Shares
and Restricted Closing Shares to which such holder is entitled as set forth on

(to the extent possible), for which their Company Membership Interests are
exchangeable at the Closing, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ and
_Section 2.5(c)_, less such holder's proportionate share of the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to the escrow as provided in _Section
2.8 _below. Any Restricted Post-Closing Shares to be issued pursuant to
_Section 2.5(a)(ii)_ shall be (i) issued within five (5) business days of a
holder of Restricted Shares becoming entitled thereto, with no additional
authorization required after the Closing from the board of directors of
Parent and (ii) allocated among the holders of Restricted Shares in
the respective proportions set forth on _Schedule 2.5(a)(iii)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

agreement contained in _Section 6.3_ or _Section 7.23_ hereof has been made
and Escrow Shares allocable to the Blocker Owner or Blocker Owners Affiliated

with such Blocker Entity shall be reduced accordingly. Any Escrow Shares held
in the escrow account following the Escrow Termination Date in respect of an
unresolved claim for indemnification, if not applied as indemnification with

and Blocker Owners as promptly as practicable following such resolution in
the same proportions as are set forth on _Schedule 2.5(a)(iii) _of the
Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , that, to the extent a claim for
indemnification relating to (A) the inaccuracy or breach of any

contained in _Section 6.3_ or _Section 7.23_ hereof has been made and

the contrary herein, following the Closing, the Escrow Shares shall be the
sole remedy of Parent, its Affiliates and all Parent Indemnitees for the

of Parent shall appoint a committee (the " _Committee_ ") consisting of one
or more of its then members to act on behalf of Parent to take all necessary
actions and make all decisions pursuant to the Escrow Agreement on behalf of

directors of Parent or, after the consummation of the Merger, a majority of
those Persons who served on Parent's board of directors immediately prior to
the Closing Date, shall appoint as a successor member of the Committee some
other Person who would qualify as an " _independent_ " director of Parent and

Except as set forth in the letter dated as of the date of this Agreement
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company prior to or in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure
Letter_ "), Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:

  



  

5.1 _Organization and Qualification_.

  



  

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or limited
liability company duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite
corporate or limited liability company power and authority to own, lease and
operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except as would not be material to Parent. Parent and each
of its Subsidiaries is in possession of all Approvals necessary to own, lease
and operate the properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted. Complete and correct copies of
the Parent Charter Documents and each of its Subsidiaries, as amended and
currently in effect, have been heretofore delivered to the Company. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of
its Charter Documents.

  



  

(b) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
to do business as a foreign corporation or limited liability company and is
in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary. Each jurisdiction in which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is so qualified or licensed is listed on _Schedule
5.1(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter.

  



  

5.2 _Parent Subsidiaries_. Parent has no direct or indirect

obligations or liabilities of any nature whatsoever. Merger Sub does not
have any assets or properties of any kind, does not now conduct and has never
conducted any business, and has and will have at the Closing no obligations
or liabilities of any nature whatsoever, except for such obligations as are
imposed under this Agreement. Merger Sub is a newly-formed entity that has

upon the conversion of the Parent Preferred Stock or any
outstanding convertible notes, debentures or securities (" _Parent

Preferred Stock subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms
and conditions specified in the instrument pursuant to which they are
issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. All outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock and all
outstanding Parent Warrants have been issued and granted in compliance in all
material respects with (x) Applicable Legal Requirements, and (y) all
requirements set forth in any applicable Parent Contracts.

  



  

(c) There are no subscriptions, options, warrants, equity securities,
partnership interests or similar ownership interests, calls,
rights (including preemptive rights), commitments or agreements of any
character to which Parent is a party or by which it is bound
obligating Parent to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered
or sold, or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, or cause the repurchase,
redemption or acquisition of, any shares of capital stock, partnership
interests or similar ownership interests of Parent or obligating Parent to
grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of or enter into any such subscription,
option, warrant, equity security, call, right, commitment or agreement.

  



  

(d) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, there are no registration
rights, and there is no voting trust, proxy, rights plan, anti-takeover plan
or other agreements or understandings to which Parent is a party or by which
Parent is bound with respect to any equity security of any class of
securities or convertible securities of Parent.

  



  

(e) Except as provided for in this Agreement, as a result of the
consummation of the Transactions, no shares of capital stock,
warrants, options or other securities of Parent are issuable and no rights in
connection with any shares, warrants, options or other securities of Parent
accelerate or otherwise become triggered (whether as to vesting,
exercisability, convertibility or otherwise).

  



  

(f) No outstanding share of Parent Common Stock or convertible
securities of Parent is unvested or subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other similar condition under any applicable agreement with
Parent.

  



  

(g) (i) The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued by Parent in
connection with the Merger (including any Contingent Shares that may
be issued), upon issuance in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
will be duly authorized and validly issued in compliance in all material
respects with (A) Applicable Legal Requirements, and (B) all requirements set
forth in any applicable Parent Contracts, and (ii) such shares of Parent
Common Stock (including any Contingent Shares that may be issued) will

5.4 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub has requisite corporate power and authority to: (a) execute, deliver and
perform this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which each of
them is a party, and each ancillary document that it has executed or
delivered or is to execute or deliver pursuant to this Agreement, and (b)
carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder and, to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which each of them is a
party, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions (including the Merger) have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub
(including the approval by its board of directors), and no other proceedings
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement
or the other Transaction Agreements to which each of them is a party or to
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, other than approval of the
Parent Stockholder Matters. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements to which each of them is a party have been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other Parties hereto,
constitute the legal and binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with their terms,
except insofar as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally or by principles governing the availability of equitable
remedies.

  



  

5.5 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

  



  

(a) Neither the execution, delivery and performance by Parent and
Merger Sub of this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements to
which each of them is a party, nor (assuming approval of the Parent
Stockholder Matters is obtained) the consummation of the Transactions shall:
(i) conflict with or violate Parent's or Merger Sub's Charter Documents, (ii)
conflict with or violate any Applicable Legal Requirements, or (iii) result
in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or materially impair
Parent's or Merger Sub's rights or alter the rights or obligations of any
third party under, or give to others any rights of consent, termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
Lien (other than any Permitted Lien) on any of the properties or assets
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Parent Contracts,
except, with respect to clauses (ii) or (iii), as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  



  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub, or the other Transaction Agreements to which either or both are a party,
does not, and the performance of their obligations hereunder and thereunder
will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or
filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity, except (i) for the
filing of the Certificates of Merger in accordance with the DLLCA, the DRUPA
and the DGCL, (ii) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, blue sky laws, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other
jurisdictions in which Parent is qualified to do business, (iii) for the
filing of any notifications required under the HSR Act and the expiration of
the required waiting period thereunder, and (iv) where the failure to obtain
such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings
or notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, or prevent consummation
of the Merger.

5.6 _Compliance_. During the period since its incorporation or

currently, in violation of any Applicable Legal Requirements with respect to

each of its Subsidiaries have not been and are not currently being

(a) Parent has timely filed all required registration statements,
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to
be filed by it with the SEC since March 23, 2015 (collectively, as they have
been amended since the time of their filing and including all exhibits
thereto, the " _Parent SEC Reports_ "). None of the Parent SEC Reports, as of
their respective dates, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or

other Governmental Entity is conducting any investigation or review of any
Parent SEC Report. The audited financial statements of Parent (" _Parent

in the case of Parent Financial Statements filed following the date hereof
will comply with, the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, (y) were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto and except with respect to
unaudited statements as permitted by Form 10 Q of the SEC) and Regulation S-X
or Regulation S-K, as applicable, in the case of interim financial
statements, to normal recurring year-end adjustments (the effect of which will
not, individually or in the aggregate, be material) and the omission of notes
to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, as
applicable, and (z) fairly present, and in the case of Parent Financial
Statements filed following the date hereof, will fairly present (subject, in
the case of the unaudited interim financial statements included therein, to
normal year-end adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes), in all
material respects the financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of
the respective dates thereof and the results of their operations and cash
flows for the respective periods then ended.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15 under the Exchange Act).

alerting Parent's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
to material information required to be included in Parent's periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act.

declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend on, or other
distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) in respect of, any of
Parent's capital stock, or any purchase, redemption or other acquisition by
Parent of any of Parent's capital stock or any other securities of Parent or
any options, warrants, calls or rights to acquire any such shares or other
securities, (c) any split, combination or reclassification of any of Parent's
capital stock, (d) any granting by Parent of any increase in compensation or

into any currently effective employment, severance, termination or
indemnification agreement or any agreement the benefits of which are
contingent or the terms of which are materially altered upon the occurrence
of a transaction involving Parent of the nature contemplated hereby, (e)
any material change by Parent in its accounting methods, principles or
practices, except as required by concurrent changes in U.S. GAAP (or any
interpretation thereof) or Applicable Legal Requirements, (f) any change in

(whether or not set forth in a written document) covering any active or
former employee, director or consultant of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is under common
control with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of Section 414 of
the Code, with respect to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has material
liability, and neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transactions will (a) result in any payment (including
severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise)
becoming due to any stockholder, director or employee of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (b) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such benefits.

party to any collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract
applicable to persons employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and

5.13 _Business Activities_. Since its organization, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has conducted any business activities other than
activities (i) in connection with its organization or (ii) directed toward the
accomplishment of a business combination. Except as set forth in the Parent
Charter Documents, there is no agreement, contract, commitment or Order
binding upon Parent or its Subsidiaries or to which Parent or its

effect of prohibiting or materially impairing any business practice of it or
its Subsidiaries, any acquisition of property by it or its Subsidiaries or

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed all Returns
required to be filed by Parent and each of its Subsidiaries with any Tax

reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in
_Article_ _VIII_ to be satisfied, (b) the obtaining of all necessary actions,

consents, approvals or waivers from third parties required as a result of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, including the consents referred
to on _Schedule 4.5_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (it being understood,
for the avoidance of doubt, that nothing herein shall require the Company in
connection therewith to incur any liability or expense or subject itself, any
of its Subsidiaries or the business of the foregoing to any imposition of any
limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own
or exercise control of their assets, properties and or membership
interests), (d) the defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations
or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have
any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (e) the execution or delivery of
any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate, and to fully
carry out the purposes of, the Transactions. This obligation shall include,

shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
use its commercially reasonable efforts to enable the Merger and the other
Transactions to be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the
Company to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its Affiliates of
shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, the
imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their
business or to own or exercise control of their respective assets, properties
and capital stock or membership interests, or the incurrence of any liability
or expense.

  



  

7.7 _No Parent Securities Transactions_. Neither the Company nor any of
its controlled Affiliates, directly or indirectly, shall engage in any
transactions involving the securities of Parent prior to the time of the
making of a public announcement regarding all of the material terms of the
business and operations of the Company and the Transactions. The Company shall
use its best efforts to require each of its officers, directors and
employees, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to require each of
its agents, advisors, contractors, associates, clients, customers and
representatives, to comply with the foregoing requirement.

  



  

   

 | 51|

7.8 _No Claim Against Trust Fund_. All parties to this Agreement other
than Parent and Merger Sub (collectively, the " _ND Parties_ ") hereby waive
all right, title, interest or claim of any kind against Parent to collect from
the Trust Fund any monies that may be owed to them by Parent for any reason
whatsoever, including but not limited to a breach of this Agreement by Parent
or any negotiations, agreements or understandings with Parent (whether in the
past, present or future), and will not seek recourse against the Trust Fund
at any time for any reason whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of _Section 10.1(b)_ (but
only if the Transactions have failed to close by the date specified
therein because of Parent's or Merger Sub's breach of an obligation herein),
_Section 10.1(d)_ or _Section 10.1(i)_, and Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries completes a business combination with another company, the ND
Parties shall not be prohibited from filing and pursuing a claim for damages
in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions following consummation
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of an alternative business combination,
in each case against Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person that
is party to such alternative business combination or any Affiliate thereof.
Furthermore, Parent and Merger Sub shall not execute any definitive agreement
related to such business combination that (a) attempts to prevent the ND
Parties from so filing or pursuing any such claim, or (b) permits the Person
that survives such combination not to assume Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligation for damages in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.
This paragraph will survive this Agreement and will not expire and will not
be altered in any way without the express written consent of Parent and the
Company.

  



  

7.9 _Disclosure of Certain Matters_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, the
Blocker Entities, and the Company will promptly provide the other
Parties with prompt written notice of any event, development or condition of
which they have knowledge that (a) is reasonably likely to cause any of the
conditions set forth in _Article_ _VIII_ not to be satisfied, or (b) would
require any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement. The Blocker
Entities, the Company and Parent shall have the obligation to supplement or
amend the Blocker Disclosure Letter, the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Parent Disclosure Letter, respectively, being delivered concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement with respect to any matter hereafter
arising or discovered which, if existing or known prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth on the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, respectively. The
obligations of each of the Blocker Entities, the Company and Parent to amend
or supplement the Blocker Disclosure Letter, Company Disclosure Letter and
the Parent Disclosure Letter, respectively, shall terminate on the Closing
Date. No such amendment or supplementation shall be effective for purposes of
_Sections 8.2(a)_, _8.3(a)_ , _10.1(d)_ and _10.1(e)_ and, in the case of
the Blocker Entities, _9.1_.

  



  

7.10 _Securities Listing_. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to

date hereof until the Closing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to keep the Company Common Stock and Company Warrants listed for trading on
Nasdaq. After the Closing, Parent and the Company shall use commercially

respective Party Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,

respective Party Representatives) concerning any merger, purchase of ownership
interests and/or assets of Parent, recapitalization or similar business

will also provide notice to the Representative) if it or, to its knowledge,
any of its or its Party Representatives receives any inquiry, proposal, offer
or submission with respect to a Company Business Combination or Parent
Business Combination, as applicable (including the identity of the Person

provision of this Agreement alleged to have been breached. Parent and Merger
Sub shall include with the Notice of Claim a copy of all papers served or
received with respect to such Third Party Claim.

  



  

(b) _Defense_. The Representative shall have the right, at its option
(subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.2(c)_ below) and at its
own expense, by written notice to Parent (which notice shall not constitute an
admission or agreement that indemnification is owed to the Parent Indemnitees
hereunder), to assume the entire control of, subject to the right of Parent to
participate (at its expense and with counsel of its choice) in, the defense,
compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim as to which such Notice of
Claim has been given, and shall be entitled to appoint a recognized and
reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent to be the lead counsel in
connection with such defense. If the Representative is permitted and elects to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim: (i) the Representative shall
diligently and in good faith defend such Third Party Claim and shall
keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of such defense; provided,
however, that Parent shall have the right to approve any settlement, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; and (ii)
Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate fully in all respects with the
Representative in any such defense, compromise or settlement thereof,
including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, and Parent and
Merger Sub shall as promptly as practicable make available to the
Representative all pertinent information and documents under its control.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the contrary herein, in
the event that the Representative provides prior written notice to Parent of
any settlement or compromise of, or offer to settle or compromise, any third-
party claim and Parent or Merger Sub withholds its consent to such settlement
or compromise then, in the event indemnification is ultimately determined to
be owing to a Parent Indemnitee hereunder, in no event shall
indemnification be provided to the Parent Indemnitees in respect of such
matter in an amount greater than the monetary amount contained in
such settlement or compromise of, or offer to settle or compromise, any
third-party claim.

  



  

(c) _Limitations of Right to Assume Defense_. The Representative shall
not be entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees and
expenses of counsel retained by Parent if the Third Party Claim relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation.

  



  

   

 | 63| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Other Limitations_. Failure to give prompt Notice of Claim or to
provide copies of relevant available documents or to furnish
relevant available data shall not constitute a defense (in whole or in part)
to any Third Party Claim by a Parent Indemnitee against the Representative
and shall not affect the Representative's duty or obligations under this
_Article IX_ , except to the extent (and only to the extent that) such
failure shall have adversely affected the ability of the Representative to
defend against or reduce its liability or caused or increased such liability
or otherwise caused the Losses for which the Representative is obligated to
be greater than such Losses would have been had Parent given the
Representative prompt notice hereunder. So long as the Representative is
defending any such action actively and in good faith, Parent and Merger Sub
shall not settle such action. Parent and Merger Sub shall as promptly as
practicable make available to the Representative all relevant records and
other relevant materials required by them and in the possession or under the
control of Parent and Merger Sub, for the use of the Representative and its
representatives and advisors in defending any such action, and shall in other
respects give reasonable cooperation in such defense.

  



  

(e) _Failure to Defend_. If the Representative fails to defend such
Third Party Claim actively and in good faith within thirty (30) days after
receiving a Notice of Claim, Parent will (upon further written notice) have
the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third
Party Claim as it may determine in its reasonable discretion, provided that
the Representative shall have the right to approve any settlement, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(f) _Cooperation_. If the Representative undertakes to defend against
any Third Party Claim, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, representatives and advisors to, fully cooperate with
the Members and the Representative and their respective counsel in the
investigation, defense and settlement thereof, including by providing access
to each other's relevant business records and other documents and employees
(it being understood that the costs and expenses of the Parent Indemnitees
relating thereto shall be considered Losses to the extent it is ultimately
determined that indemnification in respect thereof is owing under
the indemnification provisions hereof).

  



  

(g) _Parent Indemnitee Rights_. Anything in this _Section 9.2_ to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Representative shall not, without the written
consent of the Committee, settle or compromise any action or consent to the
entry of any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to each of the Parent Indemnitees
of a full and unconditional release from all liability and obligation in
respect of such action without any payment by any Parent Indemnitee.

  



  

   

 | 64| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) _Tax Claims_. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.2_ to
the contrary, if a claim shall be made by any Taxing authority, which, if
successful, might result in an indemnity claim hereunder, then such
indemnified party shall give notice to the indemnifying party in writing of
such claim and of any counterclaim the indemnified party proposes to assert (a
" _Tax Claim_ "); provided, however, the failure to give such notice shall
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.
The Representative shall exclusively control all Tax Claims which relate to
Tax returns of the Company for a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on
or before the Closing Date reflecting Taxes that flow through to a Tax return
of a holder of Company Membership Interests. The applicable Blocker Owner or
Blocker Manager shall exclusively control all Tax Claims which relate solely
to Blocker Returns; _provided_ that such Blocker Owner or Blocker Manager
shall not settle or compromise any such claim without the consent of Parent,
not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. With respect to all
other Tax Claims not described in the preceding two sentences, Parent, on the
one hand, and the Representative (together with the applicable Blocker Owner
or Blocker Manager, if such Tax Claim involves a Blocker Company), on the
other hand, shall jointly participate in any such proceedings and shall not
settle or compromise any such claim without the consent of the other, not to
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

  



  

9.3 _Insurance and Contractual Rights to Indemnification_. To the
extent that any Losses that are subject to indemnification pursuant to this 
_Article IX_ are recoverable pursuant to contractual indemnification rights or
other reimbursement arrangements or pursuant to insurance, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the maximum recovery under such insurance;
_provided_ that Parent shall nevertheless be entitled to bring a claim for
indemnification under this _Article IX_ in respect of such Losses and the
time limitations set forth in _Section 9.4_ hereof for bringing a claim of
indemnification under this Agreement shall be tolled during the pendency of
such insurance claim. If Parent has received the payment required by this
Agreement from the Representative in respect of any Loss and later receives
proceeds from insurance, contractual indemnification rights or
other reimbursement arrangements or other amounts in respect of such Loss,
then it shall hold such proceeds or other amounts in trust for the benefit of
the Representative and shall pay to the Representative, as promptly as
practicable after receipt but in any event within two (2) business days, a
sum equal to the amount of such proceeds or other amount received, up to the
aggregate amount of any payments received from the Representative pursuant to
this Agreement in respect of such Loss. Notwithstanding any other provisions
of this Agreement, it is the intention of the Parties that no insurer or any
other third party shall be (i) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled
to receive in the absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions, or (ii)
relieved of the responsibility to pay any claims for which it is obligated.

  



  

9.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein:

  



  

(a) _Survival; Time Limitation_. The covenants and agreements of the
Parties contained in this Agreement which were required to be performed prior
to the Closing shall not survive the Closing. The covenants and agreements of
the Parties contained in this Agreement which are required to be performed
after the Closing shall survive the Closing until performed for the period
explicitly specified therein and the representations and warranties of the
Parties under this Agreement will survive the Closing for the period that ends
on the date that is one (1) year after the Closing Date (the " _Survival
Periods_ ").

  



  

(b) Any indemnification claim made by Parent Indemnitees prior to the
termination of the applicable Survival Period shall be preserved (but solely
to the extent of the stated amount of such claim) despite the subsequent
termination of such period and any claim set forth in a Notice of Claim sent
prior to the expiration of such period shall survive until final resolution
thereof. No claim for indemnification under this _Article IX_ shall be
brought after the end of the applicable Survival Period.

  



  

   

 | 65| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Deductible_. No indemnification shall be payable under _Article
IX_ unless and until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses exceeds
$5,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event a Parent Indemnitee may
claim indemnification for Losses in excess of such Deductible, but in no
event in excess of the Escrow Shares.

  



  

(d) _Calculation of Losses_. The amount of any Losses subject to
indemnification under _Article IX_ shall be calculated net of (i)
any recoverable third party insurance proceeds or contractual indemnification
rights or other reimbursement arrangements, and (ii) any Tax benefit realized
in the year of the Losses by the applicable Parent Indemnitee or its
Affiliates arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence or payment of
any such Losses. No Parent Indemnitee may recover indemnification in respect
of any matter to the extent (v) such matter was reflected in the Financial
Statements, (w) a Parent Indemnitee could have, with commercially reasonable
efforts, mitigated or prevented such Loss (or any part thereof), (x) such Loss
(or any part thereof) results from or is increased by the action or inaction
of any Parent Indemnitee or any Affiliate thereof, (y) such Loss (or any part
thereof) arises, or is increased, as a result of a change after the Closing in
any accounting principle, method or policy or (z) that Parent, Merger Sub,
any of their respective Affiliates, or any of its or their respective
officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors (A) had knowledge at
or before the Closing of the facts as a result of which such Loss (or any
part thereof) arose or (B) was provided access to, at or before the Closing, a
document disclosing such facts.

  



  

(e) _Post-Closing Periods_. The Parent Indemnitees shall not have any
right to indemnification with respect to, or based on, Taxes to the
extent such Taxes are attributable to Tax periods (or portions thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date.

  



  

9.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Parent, on behalf of itself and the other
Parent Indemnitees, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that, from and
after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Indemnitees
with respect to any and all claims arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the Transactions shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article IX_ , subject to the limitations set
forth herein, and limited to the Escrow Shares. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing, nothing contained in this _Article IX_ shall in any way impair,
modify or otherwise limit any Party's (i) rights under the Blocker Side
Letter or (ii) ability to bring a Legal Proceeding based upon actual and
intentional fraud, it being understood that a mere breach of a representation
and warranty does not constitute fraud and that the representations and
warranties have been drafted to allocate risk among the Parties, _provided_
that in any event the maximum aggregate amount that may be recovered by a
Parent Indemnitee shall not exceed the Merger Consideration and no Member
shall be liable for more than its respective proportion of the Merger
Consideration as set forth on _Schedule 2.5(a)(iii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

  



  

   

 | 66| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

9.6 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Escrow Shares transferred to
a Parent Indemnitee for indemnification under _Article IX_ shall be deemed to
be an adjustment to the Merger Consideration, except as otherwise required by
Applicable Legal Requirement.

  



  

9.7 _Representative Capacities; Application of Escrow_. The Parties
acknowledge that the Representative shall have no personal responsibility
in his capacity as Representative, and that all recovery by any Parent
Indemnitee in respect of any matter relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be limited to the Escrow Shares. Out-of-pocket expenses of
the Representative for attorneys' fees and other costs shall be reimbursed in
accordance with the terms of the Member/Blocker Owner Acknowledgment
Agreement. The Parties further acknowledge that all actions to be taken by
the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be taken on their
behalf by the Committee in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent, pursuant to a joint written direction of the
Parties or a final and non-appealable order of a Governmental Entity directing
the taking of such action, may apply all or a portion of the Escrow Shares,
as appropriate, to satisfy claims for indemnification pursuant to this
_Article IX_. The Escrow Agent will hold the remaining portion of the Escrow
Shares until final resolution of all claims for indemnification or disputes
relating thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Representative shall have no liability to the Company or any Member
thereof, any Blocker Entity, any Party hereto or any Parent Indemnitee for any
action taken or omitted to be taken hereunder, unless such liability is
determined by a judgment or a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the willful misconduct of the Representative. The Surviving
Company shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Representative for all
losses, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and
costs of investigation) arising out of or in connection with, the performance
by the Representative of its duties and obligations under this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement, unless such liability is determined by a judgment or a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the willful misconduct
of the Representative.

  



  

9.8 _Mitigation_. A Parent Indemnitee shall use its commercially
reasonably efforts to mitigate Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by it
arising out of any matter for which it may be entitled to indemnification
hereunder; _provided_ that no Parent Indemnitee shall be required to take any
action or refrain from taking any action that is contrary to any Applicable
Legal Requirement or applicable contract binding on it or any Affiliate
thereof.

the purpose of extending the date by which Parent is required to have
completed a business combination (July 27, 2017 or such later date to which
the Company gives its prior written consent, the " _Outside Date_ "); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this

failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the
Merger to occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act
constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

curable by the Company prior to the Closing, then Parent must first provide

11.3 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and each other
document executed in connection with the Transactions, and the
consummation thereof, may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same document and shall
become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of

executed by a Party shall be deemed to meet the requirements of the previous
sentence.

  



  

11.4 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and
the documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties hereto
as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto (a) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to

Parent and the Company dated March 8, 2017 (the " _Letter of Intent_ ") is
hereby terminated in its entirety and shall be of no further force and effect

Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions); and (b) other than the
provisions of _Section 7.13_ and _Section 11.17(e)_, and the rights, at and
after the Effective Time, of Persons pursuant to the provisions of _Section

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

11.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement,
or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto. The Parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  



  

11.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, prior to the Closing, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the
exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United
States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

11.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal law of the State of Delaware regardless of
the law that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of law thereof.

hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the
courts of the State of Delaware or the federal courts located in the State of
Delaware in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions, agrees that process may be served upon them in
any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such Persons
and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which
they might otherwise have to such manner of service of process. Each Party
and any Person asserting rights as a third party beneficiary may do so only
if he, she or it hereby waives, and shall not assert as a defense in any legal
dispute, that (a) such Person is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above named courts for any reason, (b) such Legal Proceeding may
not be brought or is not maintainable in such court, (c) such Person's
property is exempt or immune from execution, (d) such Legal Proceeding is
brought in an inconvenient forum or (e) the venue of such Legal Proceeding is
improper. EACH OF THE PARTIES AND ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD
PARTY BENEFICIARY MAY DO SO ONLY IF HE, SHE OR IT IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIMS OR
COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM RELATING THERETO. IF THE SUBJECT MATTER
OF ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL IS
PROHIBITED, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARY SHALL ASSERT IN SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE A NONCOMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. FURTHERMORE,
NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL
SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE WITH A SEPARATE ACTION OR
OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED.

their respective Affiliates, and even though Prior Counsel may have

Agreement, the transactions contemplated by the foregoing or any dispute
arising in connection with the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Privileged Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be attorney-client
privileged and that the Privileged Communication and the expectation of
client confidence relating thereto belong solely to each Member, shall be
controlled by the Representative on behalf of the Members, and shall not pass
to or be claimed by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or any of their
Affiliates.

_multiplied by_ ($900,000,000 _divided by_  $1,000,000,000))) _plus_ (0.25
_multiplied by_ ($10.218 _multiplied by_ ($800,000,000 _divided by_
$1,000,000,000)));

  



  

(iii) Which is equal to (i) $100,000,000, _divided by_ (ii) ((0.75
