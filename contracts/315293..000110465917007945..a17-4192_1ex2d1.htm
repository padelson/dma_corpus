into this Agreement with the common understanding that the Purchased Assets of
the Polish Asset Seller constitute an organized part of the enterprise (Pol.

Polish Tax regulations. Should any tax or legal advice received by the Seller

a revised common approach, which could include an application for an
individual tax ruling by the Polish Asset Seller and/or Buyer (or Designated
Purchaser).

ARTICLE III 
PURCHASE PRICE

 



 

Section 3.1 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the Equity
Interests and Purchased Assets shall be equal to $4,300,000,000 (Four Billion
Three Hundred Million Dollars) (the " ** _Base Purchase Price_** ") _plus_ the
Final Cash Amount _minus_ Final

 



      
 

 



 

Indebtedness _minus_ Final Transaction Expenses Amount _plus_ the Working
Capital Excess or _minus_ the Working Capital Deficit (the Base Purchase
Price, as so adjusted, the " ** _Purchase Price_** "). The Purchase Price
shall be paid pursuant to _ARTICLE IV_ and to Seller Parent as agent for the
account of the Selling Parties.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Allocation of Purchase Price; Transfer Tax Valuation_.

 



 

(a) Within ninety (90) business days following the final determination of the
Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 4.5_ Buyer shall deliver to Seller
Parent a schedule (the " ** _Allocation Schedule_** ") allocating the Purchase
Price (increased to take into account the Assumed Liabilities for federal
income Tax purposes and the liabilities of the Business Subsidiaries, as
appropriate) among the Purchased Assets and the assets of the Business
Subsidiaries, as appropriate. The Allocation Schedule shall be reasonable and
shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
regulations thereunder. If, within forty-five (45) days following delivery of
the Allocation Schedule, Seller Parent notifies Buyer in writing of its good
faith disagreement with the Allocation Schedule, Seller Parent and Buyer shall
reasonably and in good faith endeavor to resolve such disagreement. If the
parties are unable to reach an agreement within sixty (60) days following
Seller Parents notice of disagreement, however, they shall be permitted to
take differing positions with respect to the allocation of the Purchase Price
among the Purchased Assets and the assets of the Business Subsidiaries;
_provided_ that in all events and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, each of Seller Parent and Buyer shall allocate an amount equal to
$75,000,000 of the Purchase Price to the Equity Interests of Aon Hewitt
Intermediaries Inc. If Seller Parent does not notify Buyer of any such
disagreement, the Allocation Schedule shall become final. Seller Parent and
Buyer each agree to file IRS Form 8594, and all federal, state, local and
foreign Tax Returns, in accordance with (i) an agreed-upon Allocation Schedule
if applicable and (ii) the allocation of $75,000,000 of the Purchase Price to
the Equity Interests of Aon Hewitt Intermediaries Inc. Seller Parent and
Buyer each agree to provide the other promptly with any other information
required to complete IRS Form 8594. In the event any adjustment to the
Purchase Price is made pursuant to this Agreement following the determination
of the Allocation Schedule under this _Section 3.2(a)_, the Allocation
Schedule shall be further revised to allocate such adjustment to the Purchased
Assets and the assets of the Business Subsidiaries based upon the item to
which such adjustment is attributable or, to the extent such adjustment cannot
be allocated to a specific asset or jurisdiction, as the parties, acting in
good faith, agree is most appropriate under the circumstances. If the
installment sale rules under Section 453 of the Code apply to any payment
contemplated by _Section 4.7_, the parties agree that the entire amount of
such payment shall be allocable to Class VII assets (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-6).

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent and Buyer shall cooperate in good
faith to agree on the valuation of the Equity Interests and Purchased Assets
to the extent that valuations are needed for purposes of determining the
amount of Transfer Taxes or to the extent a given jurisdiction requires a
separate allocation of the Purchase Price to such jurisdiction prior to the
Closing. If the parties disagree with respect to a proposed valuation, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the issue. To the extent that
applicable law in a given jurisdiction requires agreement by the parties on
the allocation of the Purchase Price or a determination of the amount of
Transfer Taxes due, and the parties are unable to resolve the

 



      
 

 



 

issue prior to the Closing Date, such issue shall be resolved by the Tax
Accountant as promptly as practicable in advance of the Closing Date, and any
such determination by the Tax Accountant shall be final. The cost of the Tax
Accountant shall be borne equally by Seller Parent and Buyer. Where agreement
between the parties is not required by applicable law and the parties cannot
resolve the issue prior to the Closing Date, the parties shall be permitted to
take differing positions with respect to the valuations establishing the
amount of Transfer Taxes or the allocation of Purchase Price to a given
jurisdiction; provided that in all events, each of Seller Parent and Buyer
shall allocate an amount equal to $75,000,000.00 of the Purchase Price to the
Equity Interests of Aon Hewitt Intermediaries Inc.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) each payment made pursuant to
this Agreement shall be made net of any Taxes required by applicable
Requirements of Law to be deducted or withheld from such payment and (b) any
amounts deducted or withheld from any such payment shall be remitted to the
applicable taxing authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid. In the event Buyer determines that amounts
required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement on the Closing Date are subject
to deduction or withholding in respect of Taxes, then Buyer shall notify
Seller Parent of such deduction or withholding at least ten (10) days prior to
the Closing Date and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to reduce or
eliminate any such deduction or withholding; _provided_ that Buyer shall have
no obligation to notify Seller Parent of any deduction or withholding
resulting from the failure to deliver the forms described in _Section
4.4(k)_, and/or _Section 4.4(o)_; _provided_ , _further_ that, except
pursuant to the disclosure under _Section 5.6(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, no such deduction or withholding shall be made with respect to the
sale by Aon Mauritius Holdings of its Equity Interests in Aon HR Services
India Private Limited.

prepare and deliver to Seller Parent a written statement (the " ** _Closing
Statement_** ") setting forth Buyers proposed final calculations of (i) the
Cash Amount as of the open of business on the Closing Date (" ** _Closing Cash
Amount_** "), (ii) Indebtedness as of the open of business on the Closing Date
(" ** _Closing Indebtedness_** "), (iii) Transaction Expenses as of the open
of business on the Closing Date (" ** _Closing Transaction Expenses Amount_**
") and (iv) Net Working Capital as of the open of business on the Closing Date
(" ** _Closing Working Capital_** "). The Closing Statement shall be prepared
in accordance with _Section 4.5_ _(g)_. Seller Parent and Buyer agree that
the purpose of the process set forth in this _Section 4.5_ is solely to
determine the Final Cash Amount, Final Indebtedness, Final Transaction
Expenses Amount and the Final Working Capital in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, and such process is not intended to permit the introduction of
different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies (for the purpose of
determining the Final Cash Amount, Final Indebtedness, Final Transaction
Expenses Amount or the Final Working Capital) in a manner inconsistent with
the Agreed Accounting Principles; rather, this _Section 4.5_ requires that
the calculations of Closing Cash Amount, Final Cash Amount, Closing
Indebtedness, Final Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses Amount, Final
Transaction Expenses Amount, Closing Working Capital and Final Working Capital
be done in a manner consistent with _Section 4.5_ _(g)_.

 



 

(b) Seller Parent shall have forty-five (45) days (the " ** _Review Period_**
") after Buyers delivery of the Closing Statement to review the same. During
the Review Period, Seller Parent and its duly authorized advisors and
representatives shall, upon reasonable notice, have full, complete and
continuing access at all reasonable times, including during regular business
hours, to the personnel, properties, work papers, books and records of the
Business pertaining to or used in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Statement to the extent necessary for Seller Parents confirmation of
the same. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller Parent
and/or a firm of independent public accountants designated by Seller Parent ("
** _Seller Parent s Accountants_**") shall be permitted to discuss with Buyer
and its accountants the Closing Statement and shall be provided copies of the
relevant records and working papers of Buyer and its accountants related to
the Closing Statement. If Seller Parent so disputes any items in the Closing
Statement, Seller Parent may, within the Review Period, deliver one written
notice to Buyer of the same, specifying in reasonable detail the rationale for
each such permitted dispute and the amount(s) in dispute, and, if practicable,
attaching reasonably detailed supporting information and Seller Parents
proposed modifications to the Closing Statement (such notice, the " **
_Dispute Notice_** "). Only disputes with respect to the Closing Statement (as
permitted hereby) are to be addressed in the Dispute Notice, and all other
disputes hereunder shall be subject to _Section 13.3_. The Closing Statement
will be deemed to be accepted by and shall be conclusive for purposes of this
Agreement except to the extent, if any, that Seller Parent shall have
delivered within the Review Period a Dispute Notice. Buyer and Seller Parent
shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement as to any matters properly
identified in a timely delivered Dispute Notice as being in dispute and all
discussions related thereto shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules
of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule (and evidence of such
discussions shall not be admissible or used by any party in any future
proceedings between the

 



      
 

 



 

parties, including any proceedings before or with the Accounting Firm). If
Buyer and Seller Parent fail to resolve all such matters included in the
Dispute Notice within thirty (30) days after Seller Parents timely delivery
of such Dispute Notice to Buyer (the " ** _Resolution Period_** "), then any
matters identified in such Dispute Notice that remain in dispute following the
expiration of the Resolution Period shall, subject to the last sentence of
this _Section 4.5_ _(b)_ , be finally and conclusively determined by KPMG LLP
or such other independent accounting firm that is mutually selected by the
parties (the " ** _Accounting Firm_** ") (it being understood that in making
such determination, the Accounting Firm shall be functioning as an expert and
not as an arbitrator). Each of Seller Parent and Buyer shall execute and
deliver a customary engagement letter as may be reasonably requested by the
Accounting Firm. Seller Parent and Buyer shall instruct the Accounting Firm to
promptly, but no later than thirty (30) days after the deadline set forth in
the Accounting Firm Notice (as the same may be amended by the mutual written
agreement of the Accounting Firm, Buyer and Seller Parent), determine (based
solely on the written presentations of Buyer and Seller Parent timely
delivered to the Accounting Firm in accordance with this _Section 4.5_ _(b)_
and not by independent review) only those matters in dispute and to render a
written report as to the disputed matters and the resulting calculations of
the Final Cash Amount, Final Indebtedness, Final Transaction Expenses Amount
and the Final Working Capital, which report, absent manifest error, shall
thereupon be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto for all purposes
hereunder. Buyer and Seller Parent shall instruct the Accounting Firm that,
within five (5) business days following its acceptance of its appointment as
the Accounting Firm, it shall deliver to Buyer and Seller Parent a written
notice (the " ** _Accounting Firm Notice_** ") setting forth (i) the deadline
for Buyers and Seller Parents submission of the written presentations
referenced in the immediately preceding sentence (which deadline shall in all
events be (A) the same for Buyer and Seller Parent and (B) no sooner than
thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of the Accounting Firm Notice
(unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing among the Accounting Firm, Buyer
and Seller Parent) and no later than sixty (60) days following the date of the
Accounting Firm Notice) and (ii) the format in which Buyer and Seller Parent
are to submit their written presentations (which format shall be reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and Seller Parent). The Accounting Firm shall make its
determination based solely on the basis of (A) a single written presentation
submitted by each of Buyer and Seller Parent no later than the deadline set
forth in the Accounting Firm Notice (as the same may be amended by the mutual
written consent of the Accounting Firm, Buyer and Seller Parent), which the
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to distribute to Buyer and Seller Parent
upon receipt of both such presentations, and (B) one written response of Buyer
and Seller Parent to each such presentation so submitted, which the Accounting
Firm shall be instructed to distribute to Buyer and the Seller Parent upon
receipt of such responses. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm
shall be bound by the provisions of this _Section 4.5_ _(b)_ and _Section
4.5_ _(g)_ and may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by Buyer or Seller Parent, or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by Buyer or Seller Parent. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by the party whose position with
respect to the matter in dispute is furthest from the Accounting Firms final
determination. If, before the Accounting Firm renders its determination with
respect to the disputed items in accordance with this _Section 4.5_ _(b)_ ,
(x) Seller Parent notifies Buyer and the Accounting Firm of its agreement with
any items in the Closing Statement or (y) Buyer notifies Seller Parent and the
Accounting Firm of its agreement with any items in the Dispute Notice, then in
each case such items as so

 



      
 

 



 

agreed shall be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto for all purposes
hereunder immediately upon such notice (and the Person providing such notice
of acceptance shall pay the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm).

 



 

(c) The calculation of the Closing Cash Amount, as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 4.5_, shall constitute the " ** _Final Cash Amount_** " for
purposes of this Agreement. The calculation of the Closing Indebtedness, as
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 4.5_, shall constitute the " **
_Final Indebtedness_** " for purposes of this Agreement. The calculation of
the Closing Transaction Expenses Amount, as finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 4.5_, shall constitute the " ** _Final Transaction Expenses
Amount_** " for purposes of this Agreement. The calculation of the Closing
Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 4.5_, shall
constitute the " ** _Final Working Capital_** " for purposes of this
Agreement. The date on which the Final Cash Amount, Final Indebtedness, Final
Transaction Expenses Amount and the Final Working Capital are finally
determined in accordance with this _Section 4.5_ is hereinafter referred to
as the " ** _Determination Date_**."

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) if Final Working Capital is less than
the Target Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
4.5_, then the amount by which Final Working Capital is less than the Target
Working Capital, expressed as an absolute value, shall be referred to herein
as the " ** _Working Capital Deficit_** " and (ii) if Final Working Capital is
greater than the Target Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 4.5_, then the amount by which Final Working Capital exceeds the
Target Working Capital, expressed as an absolute value, shall be referred to
herein as the " ** _Working Capital Excess_** ").

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the " ** _Post-Closing Adjustment
Amount_** " means the amount, expressed as a positive or negative number or
zero, as applicable, of (i) the Purchase Price (reflecting the Working Capital
Excess or Working Capital Deficit, Final Indebtedness, Final Transaction
Expenses Amount and the Final Cash Amount as finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 4.5_) _minus_ (ii) the Preliminary Purchase Price. If the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then, within five (5) business
days after the Determination Date, Seller Parent shall pay to Buyer an amount
in cash equal to the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified in
writing to Seller Parent by Buyer. If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a
positive number, then, within five (5) business days after the Determination
Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller Parent an amount in cash equal to the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account specified in writing to Buyer by Seller Parent. If the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount is zero, then no payment shall be made pursuant to this
_Section 4.5_.

 



 

(f) Any payment required to be made pursuant to this _Section 4.5_ shall be
made together with interest thereon from the date such payment was required to
be paid pursuant to _Section 4.5(e)_ to (and including) the date of payment
at the rate of interest per annum equal to 30 day LIBOR in effect on the
Closing Date as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_.

 



       
 

 



 

(g) Seller Parents calculation of the Preliminary Purchase Price, the Closing
Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital, Estimated Closing
Working Capital, and Final Working Capital shall be (i) consistent with the
definition of "Net Working Capital," (ii) in a format substantially similar to
the Sample Working Capital Statement, (iii) prepared and determined from the
Books and Records (to the extent applicable), (iv) determined in accordance
with the Agreed Accounting Principles (including GAAP consistently applied,
and, to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the policies, principles and
methodologies applied in connection with the preparation of the audited
combined balance sheet of the Business at December 31, 2015), (v) determined
without giving effect to any purchase accounting or similar adjustments and
(vi) consistent with the provisions of this Agreement relating to the
respective rights and obligations of the parties hereto for the payment or
reimbursement of costs and expenses.

 



 

(h) Except as otherwise required by applicable Requirements of Law, all
payments made pursuant to this _Section 4.5_ shall be treated by the parties
hereto as adjustments to the Purchase Price for income Tax purposes.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Deferred BD Subsidiary Closing_.

 



 

(a) _Deferred BD Subsidiary Closing Generally_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Seller Parent and Buyer agree that written
approval from FINRA pursuant to NASD Rule 1017 (the " ** _FINRA Approval_** ")
is not a condition to the Closing and that no agreement with FINRA or any
other Governmental Body or Governmental Order that has the effect of
restraining or prohibiting the direct or indirect purchase and sale of the
equity interests of the BD Subsidiary (the " ** _BD Equity Interests_** ")
shall cause a failure of the conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1_ , _9.2_ ,
_10.1_ or _10.2_ to be satisfied and (ii) in the event that any of (A) FINRA
Approval has not been received by the parties and the parties have not
received assurance from FINRA in a manner reasonably satisfactory to each of
Seller Parent and Buyer that FINRA does not intend to impose interim
restrictions in accordance with NASD Rule 1017(c)(1) that have the effect of
restraining or prohibiting the direct or indirect purchase and sale of the BD
Equity Interests contemplated hereby (" ** _Interim Restrictions_** ") in each
case by the Closing Date, (B) FINRA has imposed Interim Restrictions or any
other restrictions that would have a material adverse effect on the BD
Subsidiary and have not been waived in writing by Buyer (a " ** _FINRA
Approval Restriction_** "), including without limitation any requirement to
maintain an amount of Regulatory Capital in excess of the amount of Regulatory
Capital required under Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act as of the date hereof
or (C) the RIC Consent has not been received, then, notwithstanding the
occurrence of the Closing, the closing of the direct or indirect purchase by
Buyer of the BD Equity Interests shall be postponed to a date following the
Closing Date that is no later than the first anniversary of the date of this
Agreement (the **" _Outside Deferred Closing Date_ ") **unless otherwise
agreed in writing by Seller Parent and Buyer. Seller Parent and Buyer further
agree that upon the receipt by the parties prior to the Outside Deferred
Closing Date of (1) the FINRA Approval without imposition of any FINRA

in writing by Seller Parent and Buyer, Seller Parent and Buyer shall hold a
closing with respect to the BD Equity Interests (such closing, the " **
_Deferred BD Closing_** " and the date on which such Deferred BD Closing is
actually held is referred to herein as the " ** _Deferred BD Closing Date_**
"); provided that the Deferred BD Closing Date shall occur no later than the
third (3rd) business day after the

 



      
 

 



 

date on which such FINRA Approval has been received by the parties, or at such
earlier time as agreed in writing by Seller Parent and Buyer. For the
avoidance of doubt (x) in the event of any of subparagraphs (A) \- (C) of this
_Section 4.6(b)_, the legal interest in and to the BD Equity Interests shall

to an Affiliate of Seller Parent (other than any Business Subsidiary), (ii)
subject to the applicable provisions of _Sections 7.3_ , Seller Parent and
Buyer shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
FINRA Approval, as applicable, as promptly as practicable and (iii) until the
earlier of the Deferred BD Closing and the Outside Deferred Closing Date,
except (A) as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (B) with the prior
written approval of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) or (C) as may be required to comply with any applicable Requirements
of Law, (1) Seller Parent shall cause such Affiliate to use its reasonable
best efforts (x) to operate the BD Subsidiary in the ordinary course and
substantially as operated immediately prior to the date of this Agreement and
(y) to preserve the goodwill of the suppliers, contractors, licensors,
employees, customers, clients, distributors and others having business
relations with the BD Subsidiary and (2) Seller Parent and Buyer will
cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which Buyer would, in
compliance with Requirements of Law, obtain the benefits and assume the
obligations and bear the economic burdens associated with the BD Subsidiary in
accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) Seller
Parent and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to make any investment in,
or to make any loan or other capital contribution to, the BD Subsidiary,
except to the extent necessary to meet the Regulatory Capital requirements of
the BD Subsidiary in effect on the date hereof or as modified by the SEC or
FINRA after the date hereof through the Deferred BD Closing Date, and (y)
"ordinary course" operations that are "substantially as operated immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement" shall not be the same as prior to the
Closing Date (by sole reason of the transactions consummated on the Closing
Date and the impact thereof) and neither Seller Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any responsibility to, or liability for, failure to
operate the BD Subsidiary in the ordinary course, substantially as operated
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, by reason of any change
solely from the transactions consummated on the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Deferred Closing Mechanics_. At the Deferred BD Closing, Seller Parent
shall cause its applicable Affiliate to deliver to Buyer customary evidence of
ownership of the BD Equity Interests, and Buyer shall pay Seller Parent an
amount equal to the Seller Parents cost to fund the ongoing operations of the
BD Subsidiary from and after the Closing Date until the occurrence of the
Deferred BD Closing (without allocating any corporate level expenses of Seller
Parent or any Subsidiary to the BD Subsidiary), including the amount of any
contribution to capital made by Seller Parent or its Affiliate to the BD
Subsidiary necessary to meet any increase in the Regulatory Capital
requirements of the BD Subsidiary occurring after the Closing Date. Neither
Seller Parent nor any of its Affiliates makes any representation or warranty
of any

 



      
 

 



 

kind whatsoever, whether express or implied, at law or in equity, with respect
to the BD Subsidiary except as set forth in _ARTICLE V_.

 



 

(d) _Winddown_. In the event that either the Deferred BD Closing does not
occur on or before the Outside Deferred Closing Date, then all obligations of
Buyer and its Affiliates and Seller Parent and its Affiliates under this
_Section 4.6_ with respect to the BD Subsidiary shall cease immediately upon
the Outside Deferred Closing Date, and as of such date, Seller Parent, in its
sole discretion, shall have the right to commence the winding down of the BD
Subsidiary in a manner that Seller Parent deems reasonable.

Purchaser) to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated hereby; or

 



 

(ii) require the approval, consent, authorization or act of, or the making by
Buyer (or any Designated Purchaser) of any declaration, filing or registration

Section 6.4 _Investment Intent; Information; Securities Matters_.

 



 

(a) Buyer is acquiring the Equity Interests as an investment for its own
account and not with a view to the distribution thereof in violation of any
federal or state securities laws. Buyer shall not sell, transfer, assign,
pledge or hypothecate any of the Equity

(b) Buyer acknowledges that it has (i) conducted an independent investigation
and verification of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,

merits and risks of this purchase, and (ii) relied solely on the results of
its own independent investigation and verification and the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement (including the Seller
Disclosure Letter), the Buyer Ancillary Agreements and Seller Ancillary
Agreements and any certificates delivered pursuant hereto and thereto; in
making its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Buyer further acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to ask

Parent and its Affiliates with respect to the Business and Persons acting on
and Seller Parents behalf with respect to the Business concerning the terms
and conditions of the purchase of the Equity Interests.

 



 

(c) Buyer has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in
the Equity Interests, and Buyer is capable of bearing the economic risks of
such investment, including a complete loss of its investment in the Equity
Interests. Buyer acknowledges that the Equity Interests have not been
registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities Requirements of
Law, and understands and agrees that it may not sell or dispose of any of the
Equity Interests except pursuant to a registered offering in compliance with,
or in a transaction exempt from, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and any other applicable state, foreign or federal securities
Requirements of Law.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.4_ shall in any
way impair or limit, or be used as a defense against, any claims of, or causes
of action arising from, actual and intentional fraud in respect of making the
representations set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Buyer has delivered to Seller Parent true and complete copies of (i) the
Equity Commitment Letters, pursuant to which the Parents have committed,
subject only to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest the amounts set
forth therein on the date on which the Closing should occur pursuant to
_Section 4.1_ and to which Seller Parent is an express third-party
beneficiary (the " ** _Equity Financing_** "), and (ii) the executed
commitment letter (together with the term sheet and any other annexes,
exhibits, schedules, annexes and other attachments thereto) **,** dated as of
the date hereof (the " ** _Debt Commitment Letter_** " and, together with the
Equity Commitment Letters, the " ** _Financing Commitments_** ") from the
lenders party thereto (the " ** _Lenders_** " or the " ** _Financing
Sources_** "), pursuant to which the Lenders have committed, subject only to
the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend to Buyer the amounts set
forth therein for purposes of funding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " ** _Debt Financing_** " and, together with the Equity
Financing, the " ** _Financing_** "). Buyer has also delivered to Seller
Parent true and complete copies of any fee letter (with only the numerical
amounts, "market

 



      
 

 



 

flex" provisions and other customary threshold amounts and "securities demand"
related provisions provided therein subject to customary redactions (none of
which individually is a condition to the availability of the Debt Financing or
in the aggregate would reduce the amount of the Debt Financing or adversely
affect the availability of the Debt Financing or delay or prevent the Closing
or constitute a condition to funding the Debt Financing on the Closing Date))
relating to the Debt Commitment Letter (any such fee letter, a " ** _Fee
Letter_** "). As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or
other agreements, arrangements or understandings relating to the Debt
Financing (other than the Fee Letter) to which Buyer or Parents or any of
their Affiliates is a party other than the engagement letter referred to in
paragraph 10 of Exhibit D to the Debt Commitment Letter delivered to Seller
Parent prior to the date hereof (the " ** _Engagement Letter_** "), a true and
complete copy of which has been delivered by Buyer to Seller Parent.

 



 

(b) As of the date hereof, assuming the Debt Financing is funded in full in
accordance with the Debt Commitments Letter on the Closing Date, the aggregate
net proceeds from the Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with the
Financing Commitments, together with proceeds of the Equity Financing, will be
sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Buyer for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are
sufficient for the satisfaction when due of all of the obligations of Buyer
and Parents, in each case, under this Agreement and on the Closing Date,
including the payment of the Purchase Price and the payment of any and all
costs and expenses payable by Buyer or Parents on the Closing Date or
otherwise in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (collectively, the " ** _Financing Uses_** ").

 



 

(c) As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and
effect and have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded or, except as
permitted by _Section 7.7_ after the date hereof, otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect; _provided_ that the existence or
exercise of "market flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter, as in effect
on the date of this Agreement, shall not be deemed to constitute a
modification, supplement or amendment of the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the
date hereof, each of the Financing Commitments, in the form delivered to
Seller Parent, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer and, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, each of the other parties thereto, enforceable against
such parties in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Requirements of Law of general
application relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity
principles. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other
Contracts or contractual arrangements (except for the Financing Commitments,
the Fee Letter and the Engagement Letter) relating to the Financing
Commitments. As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _ARTICLE V_, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer under any term of, or a
failure of any condition to the obligations of the Financing Sources to
provide the Financing under, the Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof,
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_ARTICLE V_, the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in
_ARTICLE IX_ and the performance by Seller Parent of its obligations under
this Agreement, Buyer has no reason to believe that it will be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing Commitments
required to be satisfied by it on or prior to the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Date. As of the date hereof, Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees
or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before
the date of this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the
Financing Sources to provide the Financing or other contractual contingencies
related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Financing. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Buyer, there is no fact,
occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions or statements set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect or that
would reasonably be expected to cause the commitments provided in the Debt
Commitment Letter to be terminated or ineffective or any of the conditions
contained therein not to be met.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Certain Arrangements_. Except as set forth in this Agreement,
there are no contracts, agreements, arrangements or understandings between
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any employee of the
Business, on the other hand, relating to the employment of or compensation to
be paid to such employee of the Business following the Closing. Except as set
forth in this Agreement, there are no contracts, agreements, arrangements or
understandings between Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any current or former Business Employee, on the other hand, in any way
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the approval
hereof.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Solvency_. Assuming (v) the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set forth in _ARTICLE IX_, (w) the performance by Seller Parent of
its obligations under this Agreement, (x) the accuracy and completeness of the
representations and warranties of the Seller Parent in _ARTICLE V
_(disregarding any references to knowledge, Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualifiers), (y) that the Financial Statements fairly present the consolidated
financial conditions of the Business as at the end of the periods covered
thereby and the consolidated results of earnings of the Business for the
periods covered thereby and (z) any financial forecasts of the Business made
available to Buyer as of the date hereof have been prepared in good faith upon
assumptions that were reasonable at such time (it being understood that the
Seller Parent is not making any representation and warranty with respect
thereto as a result of such assumption in this clause (z)), immediately after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Financing, Buyer (i) shall be able to pay its debts as they become due,
(ii) shall own property which has a fair saleable value greater than the
amounts required to pay its debts (including a reasonable estimate of the
amount of all contingent liabilities) and (iii) shall have adequate capital to
carry on its businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no
obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors of the Business.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
the Parents have delivered to Seller Parent their duly executed Guarantees.
Each Guarantee is in full force and effect and is the valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of the applicable Parent, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general application
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles,
and, as of the date hereof, no event has occurred, which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of
either Parent under either Guarantee.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.9 _No Brokers_. No broker, investment banker or other Person is
entitled to any brokers, finders or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer.

 



 

Section 6.10 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this _ARTICLE VI_, the Buyer
Ancillary Agreements and Seller Ancillary Agreements and any certificates
delivered pursuant hereto and thereto, none of Buyer or any other Person on
behalf of Buyer makes any other express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby.

 



 

ARTICLE VII 
ACTION PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE

 



 

The respective parties hereto covenant and agree to take the following actions
between the date hereof and the Closing Date:

 



 

Section 7.1 _Access to Information_. Subject to Buyers obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, Seller Parent shall and shall cause the Business
Subsidiaries and Selling Parties to afford to the officers, employees and
authorized representatives of Buyer (including independent public accountants
and attorneys) reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable
advance notice, to the offices, properties, officers and other senior
personnel and business and financial records (including computer files,
retrieval programs and similar documentation) of the Business to the extent
Buyer shall reasonably deem necessary in order to operate the Business after
the Closing and shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Buyer or its
authorized representatives such additional information concerning the Business
as shall be reasonably requested; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of Seller
Parent, the Business Subsidiaries or any Selling Party shall be required to
violate any Requirements of Law, Governmental Order or obligation of
confidentiality to which Seller Parent, the Business Subsidiaries or any
Selling Party is subject or to waive any privilege which any of them may
possess in discharging obligations pursuant to this _Section 7.1_; _provided_
, _further_ , none of Seller Parent, the Business Subsidiaries or any Selling
Party shall be required to furnish or otherwise make available to Buyer
competitively sensitive information relating to areas of the Business in which
Buyer or its Affiliates compete against any of them; and, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that neither Buyer nor any of its officers, employees, agents or
representatives shall have access to any personnel of the Business (other than
officers and other senior personnel) or any other businesses of Seller Parent
or the Selling Parties without Seller Parents prior written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld. If any material is withheld by Seller
Parent, the Business or any of the Selling Parties pursuant to the provisos to
the preceding sentence, the applicable party shall, to the extent permitted by
Requirements of Law, inform Buyer of such fact and provide a description of
the general nature of what is being withheld, and the parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents necessary, restructure
the form of access, and/or make other arrangements, so as to permit the access
requested. If so reasonably requested by Buyer, Seller Parent and Buyer shall
enter into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to the documents
and information accessed pursuant to this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 7.1_. Buyer agrees that: (A) such investigation shall be conducted
in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operations of
Seller Parent, the Business Subsidiaries and the Selling Parties; (B) all
requests by Buyer for access or availability pursuant to this _Section 7.1_
shall be submitted or directed exclusively to an individual to be designated
by Seller Parent; and (C) Seller Parent, the Business Subsidiaries and the
Selling Parties shall not be required to provide any books and records or
reports based thereon that they do not maintain or prepare in the ordinary
course of their business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of
Seller Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ shall be subject to the right of
Seller Parent to determine, in its discretion, the appropriate timing of the
disclosure of information it deems proprietary commercial information or
privileged information.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Notifications_. Each of Buyer and Seller Parent shall promptly
notify the other if it becomes aware of any action, suit or proceeding that
shall be instituted or threatened against such party to restrain, prohibit or
otherwise challenge the legality of any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other if it becomes
aware of any action, suit or proceeding that may be threatened, brought,
asserted or commenced against any Business Subsidiary, any Selling Party or
Buyer or its Affiliates, as the case may be, that would have been required to
be listed in _Section 5.10(e)_, _Section 5.10(f)_, _Section 5.14_ or
_Section 5.17(f)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter or _Section 6.3_ of the
Buyer Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, if such action, suit or
proceeding had arisen prior to the date hereof. If a party fails to notify the
other parties under this _Section 7.2_, (i) any such non-breaching party
shall only be entitled to seek indemnification for breach of this _Section
7.2_ if and to the extent such non-breaching party is otherwise entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 11.2(a)(i)_, as
the case may be, for breach of a representation and warranty and the limits
(if any) set forth in _Section 11.1(a)_ or _Section 11.2(a)_, as the case
may be, shall apply to any such indemnification and (ii) a failure to comply
with this _Section 7.2_ shall not cause the failure of any condition set
forth in _ARTICLE IX_ or _ARTICLE X_ to be satisfied unless the underlying
change, event or development would independently result in the failure of a
condition set forth in _ARTICLE IX_ or _ARTICLE X_ to be satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.2_, under no
circumstance shall any notification provided under this _Section 7.2_ be
deemed to modify or amend the Seller Disclosure Letter in any manner, nor
shall any such notification be given any effect for any purpose, including for
purposes of determining (x) the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in
_ARTICLE IX_ or _ARTICLE X_, (y) each partys rights to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE XII_ or (z) following the Closing, an
Indemnified Partys right to indemnification under _ARTICLE XI_.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Consents of Third Parties; Governmental Approvals_.

 



 

(a) (i) During the period prior to the Closing Date (or, with respect to the
closing of the sale of the BD Equity Interests, the Deferred BD Closing Date,
if applicable), Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts, and Seller
Parent, upon the request of Buyer, shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Buyer, in attempting to secure any consents and
approvals of any Third Party required to be obtained to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable (" **
_Required Third Party Consents_** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that such
action shall not include any requirement of Seller Parent, the Business
Subsidiaries, any Selling Party or any of their Affiliates to expend money,

 



      
 

 



 

commence or participate in any litigation, offer or grant any accommodation or
undertake any obligation or liability (in each case financial or otherwise) to
any Third Party; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither Buyer nor their
respective officers, employees or authorized representatives may contact any
such Third Party without providing Seller Parent with advance notice and a
reasonable opportunity to participate in any such contact. For the avoidance
of doubt, no representation, warranty or covenant of Seller Parent contained
herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be deemed
not satisfied, based on, in and of itself, (i) the failure to obtain any
Required Third Party Consents or (ii) any action, suit or proceeding commenced
or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any such Required Third Party Consents. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this _Section 7.3(a)_ shall not limit Buyers remedies with
respect to a breach of Seller Parents representations and warranties
contained in _Section 5.3(b)_. Buyer shall consult with and consider in good
faith the views of Seller Parent regarding all matters in connection with
attempting to secure any Required Third Party Consents, and the design and
implementation of the strategy for obtaining such Required Third Party
Consents and the communications related thereto shall be controlled by Seller
Parent.

 



 

(b) Buyer and Seller Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to file as
promptly as practicable and, (x) in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) below, in
any event within fifteen (15) business days after the date hereof and (y) in
the case of clause (iii) below, in any event within thirty (30) days after the
date hereof, (i) with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division

been formed as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) for all purposes under this
Agreement, each of the representations and warranties in _Article V _with

have been made as of the date of formation of such entities and the Closing
Date (and not as of the date of this Agreement), and all references to the
"date hereof" or the "date of this Agreement" contained in such
representations and warranties shall, to the extent they refer to factual
information regarding such entities, shall be deemed to be references to the
date of formation of such entities and (iii) reasonably promptly following the
date of formation of any such entity, Seller Parent shall deliver to Buyer an

Section 7.7 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall cause the Parents to fund the Equity Financing at the Closing
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letters. Buyer
shall use its

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain the Financing as soon as
reasonably practicable (taking into account the anticipated timing of the
Closing Date), on terms and conditions not less favorable to the Buyer than
those described in the Financing Commitments, including any "market flex"
provisions in the Fee Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing
Commitments on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Buyer than those
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, including any "market flex"
provisions in the Fee Letter (without regard to any adverse impact on any of
Buyers credit ratings by any rating agency) (such definitive agreements, the
" ** _Definitive Debt Financing Agreements_** "), (ii) taking into account the
anticipated timing of the Closing Date, satisfy (or obtain a waiver of) on a
timely basis all conditions and comply in all material respects with its
covenants under the Financing Commitments and, if applicable, the Definitive
Debt Financing Agreements, (iii) consummate the Financing prior to or
substantially concurrently with Closing on terms and conditions not less
favorable to the Buyer than those described in the Financing Commitments
(including any "market flex" provisions in the Fee Letter), (iv) to cause the
Lenders and other Financing Sources to fund the Financing on or prior to the
Closing Date and (v) enforce its rights under the Financing Commitments and
the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements. Other than as set forth in _Section
7.7(c)_, prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not agree to any amendments,
modifications or waivers of any condition or other provision under the
Financing Commitments or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements without the
prior written consent of Seller Parent if such amendment, modification or
waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or Equity
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount of the Debt Financing or similar fee) such that Buyer will not
have sufficient cash proceeds to pay the Purchase Price and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses required to be paid by the Buyer and Parents hereunder or in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (B) impose any new or additional condition, or otherwise amend,
modify or expand any existing condition, to the funding or receipt of the Debt
Financing or Equity Financing or (C) reasonably be expected to (x) materially
delay or prevent the Closing, (y) reasonably be expected to make the funding
of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining any of the Financing) materially less likely to occur
or (z) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letters
or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements; _provided_ that (i) Buyer may
amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement (it being understood that
the aggregate commitments of the lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter
prior to such amendment or modification (but not the aggregate commitments
thereunder) may be reduced in the amount of such additional partys
commitment) and (ii) the exercise of "market flex" provisions in the Fee
Letter as in effect on the date hereof shall not be deemed to constitute a
modification, amendment or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter. Buyer shall
use its reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the Financing
Commitments (subject to Buyers right to replace, restate, supplement, modify,
assign, substitute or amend the Financing Commitments in accordance herewith)
until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated. In the
event that all conditions to funding the commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter have been satisfied, Buyer shall use

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders and other Persons to fund the
Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, pay related fees and expenses (including paying all commitment fees
when due) and satisfy all requirements applicable to Buyer related to or
arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby on the
date of Closing. Buyer shall give Seller Parent prompt notice of any breach
(or threatened breach) or default (or threatened default) by any party to any
Financing Commitment or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements of which
Buyer has become aware or any termination of any Financing Commitment or such
definitive agreements.

 



 

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including any "market flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter (other than solely and directly as a result of Seller
Parents breach of any provision of this Agreement, or failure to satisfy the
conditions set forth in _ARTICLE IX_), Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of
such event but no later than the third (3rd) business day immediately
preceding the Termination Date, arrange and obtain from the same or
alternative sources of debt financing, which may include one or more of a
senior secured debt financing, an offering and sale of notes, or any other
financing or offer and sale of other debt securities, or any combination
thereof, in an amount sufficient to satisfy the Financing Uses, on terms and
conditions (including any "market flex" provisions) that are at least as
favorable to Buyer in the aggregate and as to certainty of funding as those
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and promptly notify Seller Parent of
the foregoing; provided that Buyer shall not be required to arrange or obtain
any alternative financing having terms and conditions (including "market flex"
provisions) less favorable to Buyer in the aggregate than those contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter. The new debt commitment letter and fee letter
entered into in connection with such alternative financing are referred to,
respectively, as a " ** _New Debt Commitment Letter_** " and a " ** _New Fee
Letter_**." In the event Buyer enters into any such New Debt Commitment
Letter, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall mean
the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified
pursuant to _clause (ii)_ below, and (ii) any reference in this Agreement to
the "Debt Commitment Letter" (and any definition incorporating the term "Debt
Commitment Letter," including the definition of Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements) shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter and any Fee
Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee
Letter, as the case may be, at the time in question and any New Debt
Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter to the extent then in effect.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall, and shall cause its representatives to, promptly following a
written request from Seller Parent, provide reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing, including by providing copies of all
drafts of the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall (i) furnish Seller Parent complete,
correct and executed copies of any amendments to any Financing Commitments
reasonably promptly upon (but not later than one day after) its execution and
(ii) give Seller Parent prompt written notice (A) of any default or breach by
any party under any of the Financing Commitments or the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements of which Buyer becomes aware, (B) of any termination of
either of the Financing Commitments, and (C) of the receipt of any written
notice or other written communication from any Lender or Parent with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to any default, breach, termination or repudiation by any party to any
Financing Commitment, any Definitive Debt Financing Agreement or of any
provision thereof.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing, at Buyers sole expense, Seller Parent shall, and
shall cause its controlled Affiliates (including each of the Selling Parties
and the Business Subsidiaries) to, in each case, use their reasonable best
efforts to provide, or use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
their respective personnel and representatives (including legal and accounting
representatives and management of the Business) to provide, to Buyer such
cooperation as is customary in connection with the arrangement of debt
financing for transactions that are substantially similar to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and reasonably requested by Buyer in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or any high yield bonds being

high yield bonds being issued in lieu of all or a portion of the Debt
Financing, and materials for rating agency presentations, including business
and financial projections reasonably requested by Buyer and (B) furnishing
consents of accountants for use of their unqualified audit reports in any
materials relating to the Debt Financing or any high-yield bonds being issued
in lieu of all or a portion of the Debt Financing, in each case, required in

Buyer and required under the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements, (A) obtaining customary documents reasonably requested
by Buyer or its Financing Sources relating to the repayment of the existing
indebtedness of the Business Subsidiaries (if any) and the release of related
liens (if any), including customary payoff letters and (B) promptly and, in
any event, at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing
all documentation and other information required by bank regulatory
authorities under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act, relating to any of the
Business Subsidiaries, in each case as reasonably requested by Buyer at least

Section 8.1 _Use of Names_. Other than (i) as set forth in _Section
2.1(b)(vii)_, subject to _Section 2.1(c)_, and (ii) any Trademark owned by
any Business Subsidiary (unless any such Trademark would be an Excluded
Trademark were it owned by any Asset Seller, in which case ownership of such
Trademark shall be subject to the plan of reorganization as detailed in
_Schedule 7.6_ and shall not be conveyed to Buyer or any Designated
Purchaser), Seller Parent is

 



      
 

 



 

not conveying ownership rights to any of the Trademarks of Seller Parent, any
Selling Party or any Affiliate of a Selling Party (collectively, the " **
_Retained Names and Marks_** "). Other than as expressly authorized under the
Transitional Trademark License Agreement, Seller Parent is not granting Buyer
or its Affiliates (including the Business Subsidiaries after the Closing) a
license to use, and after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Business Subsidiaries after the Closing) shall not use in any manner, the
Retained Names and Marks (including the names "Aon" and "Hewitt") or any word
(or other indicia of origin of goods or services) that is confusingly similar
to such Trademarks. At or within sixty (60) days following the Closing, Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Business Subsidiaries to, change each Business
Subsidiarys name to any name that does not include any of the Retained Names
and Marks (including the names "Aon" or "Hewitt") and is not confusingly
similar to, or that uses or incorporates, any of the Retained Names and Marks
(including the names "Aon" or "Hewitt"). Buyer acknowledges that a material
violation of this _Section 8.1_ would cause Seller Parent and its Affiliates
irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated for by money damages.
Buyer therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or threatened material
violation of this _Section 8.1_, Seller Parent, each Selling Party and their
respective Affiliates shall be entitled, in addition to other remedies that
they may have, to seek a temporary restraining order and to seek preliminary
and final injunctive relief against Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer to
prevent any violations of this _Section 8.1_, without the necessity of
posting a bond. Other than as expressly authorized under the Transitional
Trademark License Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Business
Subsidiaries after the Closing) shall not use, without the prior written
consent of Seller Parent, any of the Retained Names and Marks (or any name,
mark or other indicia of origin of goods or services confusingly similar
thereto) in any manner whatsoever, including in any (i) advertising or
promotional materials or (ii) stationery, business cards, business forms and
other similar items included in the Business Subsidiaries assets and
properties or the Purchased Assets, in each case that contain anywhere thereon
any of the Retained Names and Marks.

state and local Taxes, as well as all non-U.S. Taxes imposed on, allocated or

Period, a " ** _Pre-Closing Tax Period_** "), together with any interest,
penalty or additions to Tax accruing after the Closing on Taxes described in
this clause (B), (C) any liability imposed on any Business Subsidiary (or any

entered into prior to the Closing, (D) any and all Taxes imposed on any
Business Subsidiary (or any of its Affiliates) or otherwise imposed with
respect to the operation of the Business or the ownership or use of the
Purchased Assets as a result of or in connection with the Pre-Closing
Reorganization and (E) any and all Taxes of any Business Subsidiary (or their
Affiliates) or otherwise imposed with respect to the operation of the Business
or the ownership or use of the Purchased Assets resulting from the failure of
the representations and warranties contained in _Section 5.6(a)(viii)_,
_5.6(c)_ , _5.6(d)(i)_ , _5.6(f)_ or _5.6(i)_ or the failure of Seller
Parent or any Selling Party, and prior to the Closing any Business Subsidiary,

each case, determined without regard to any qualification related to
materiality or Knowledge contained therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that

Code or any similar provisions of state, local or foreign law as a result of
the purchase of the Equity Interests of any Business Subsidiary or that result

activity or transaction that would cause any sale of Equity Interests
contemplated by this Agreement to be treated as a purchase or sale of assets
of any Business Subsidiary for Tax purposes (the Taxes described in this
proviso being referred to as " ** _Excluded Taxes_** "). Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement and for the avoidance of doubt, the
limitations in _Section 11.1_ shall not apply to this _Section 8.2(a)(i)_.

that, if such amount is exceeded, Seller Parent shall bear full
indemnification responsibility for the full amount of such Taxes and other
Losses and Expenses in respect of such Taxes).

 



 

(ii) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall be liable for and pay, and agrees

respect to the Business or the Purchased Assets after the Closing Date, but in
each case, other than Taxes or Losses in respect of Taxes for which Seller
Parent is required to indemnify Buyer and any of its Affiliates (including the
Business Subsidiaries) pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ and (B) Excluded
Taxes.

 



 

(iii) For purposes of _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ , any Taxes imposed with
respect to a Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the portion of such
period ending on the Closing Date and the portion beginning after the Closing
Date (A) in the case of real and personal property Taxes, by apportioning such
Taxes on a per diem basis and (B) in

 



      
 

 



 

the case of all other Taxes, on the basis of a closing of the books as of the
open of business on the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis,
such as property Taxes, shall be apportioned on a daily basis. For purposes of
any amount required to be included under Section 951(a) of the Code with
respect to any taxable period of a Business Subsidiary that is not a United
States Person under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code that includes (but does
not end on) the Closing Date, the taxable year of the relevant Business
Subsidiary giving rise to the income required to be included under Section
951(a) of the Code shall be deemed to close in the same manner as described
above and the amount of income required to be included under Section 951(a) of
the Code to be allocated to the partial period ending at the close of the
Closing Date shall be determined by means of a closing of the books and
records as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

Excise Tax Act (Canada) (and any other similar provincial legislation).
Provided Sheppard Canada Holdings N.S. ULC makes and files such elections, the
Seller Parent agrees that no tax shall be collectible under the Excise Tax Act
(Canada) ("ETA") (or similar VAT legislation in Canada) on Closing in respect
of the sale of the Canadian Purchased Assets to Sheppard Canada Holding N.S.
ULC.

 



 

(i) _Overlap_. To the extent of any inconsistency between this _Section 8.2_
and _ARTICLE XI_, this _Section 8.2_ shall control as to Tax matters.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Employees and Employee Benefits._

 



 

(a) _Transfers of U.S. Business Employees_. Effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, (i) the employment of each U.S.
Business Employee who was not already employed by a Business Subsidiary, other
than any Inactive U.S. Business Employee, along with all liability of Seller
Parent and its Affiliates attributable to each such U.S. Business Employee,
shall be transferred to a Business Subsidiary, and (ii) the employment of each
Retained Employee or Inactive U.S. Business Employee who is employed by a
Business Subsidiary, along with all liabilities attributable to each such
Retained Employee that are not related to the Business, shall be transferred
to Seller Parent or one of its Affiliates (other than a Business Subsidiary).
Upon the Closing, the Business Subsidiaries shall not employ any Retained
Employees.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Continued Employment_. As of the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to, or to
cause an Affiliate of Buyer (including each Business Subsidiary) to, continue
to employ all of the U.S. Business Employees and all other International
Business Employees that are employed by a Business Subsidiary. All of the
Quebec Business Employees (including all such employees on vacation, leave or
other authorized absence) shall continue their employment with Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer in accordance with Requirements of Law. Nothing in this
_Section 8.3_ shall limit the ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to
terminate the employment of any employee (including any U.S. Business
Employee) at any time and for any or no reason.

 



 

(c) _Offers of Employment_. Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer
(including any Business Subsidiary) to offer each Inactive U.S. Business
Employee employment on terms and conditions consistent with this _Section
8.3(c)_ when such Inactive U.S. Business Employee presents himself or herself
to Seller Parent or one of its Affiliates or Buyer or one of its Affiliates
(including any Business Subsidiary) for active employment, so long as such
return occurs on or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date (or
such later time as such employee has reinstatement rights pursuant to
applicable Requirements of Law that would require reinstatement for a longer
duration). Buyer shall reimburse and indemnify Seller Parent and its
Affiliates for all Losses and Expenses associated with such Inactive U.S.
Business Employees employment with, or termination of employment from, Seller
Parent and its Affiliates during such two-year period following the Closing
Date (or if applicable, during a longer period in which such employee has
reinstatement rights pursuant to applicable Requirements of Law). Buyer shall,
or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to, with respect to the
International Business Employees other than any Netherlands Business Employee,
not less than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, or such earlier date
required by applicable Requirements of Law, and, with respect to the
Netherlands Business Employees, not less than seven (7) days following
notification by the Seller Parent or its Affiliates of completion of the works
council process in the Netherlands in accordance with the Dutch Works Council
Act ( _Wet op de ondernemingsraden_ ), offer employment to all International
Business Employees other than the Automatic Transfer Employees and Quebec
Business Employees (including all such employees on vacation, leave or other
authorized absence), to be effective on the Closing Date, (or (i) with respect
to the Netherlands Business Employees, to be effective on the later of the
Closing Date or the date the offer is accepted by the Netherlands Business
Employee, or (ii) with respect to the Canada Business Employees who are not
Quebec Business Employees, to be effective on the Canada Business Employee
Transfer Date), and on terms and conditions consistent with this _Section
8.3_ and applicable Requirements of Law. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each offer of employment provided by Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer to a Canada Business Employee and the continuation of
employment of each International Business Employee employed by a Business
Subsidiary on the Closing Date shall be on terms and conditions of employment
that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the terms and conditions of
employment that such employees enjoyed immediately prior to the Canada
Business Employee Transfer Date. Each such International Business Employee who
accepts such an offer of employment, along with each U.S. Business Employee,
each Quebec Business Employee and each Automatic Transfer Employee who becomes
an employee of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.3_ or
_Section 8.4_, and each Inactive U.S. Business Employee who becomes an
employee of Buyer or one of its Affiliates pursuant to this _Section 8.3(c)_
is referred to herein as a " ** _Continuing Employee_** ". If an offer of
employment to an

 



      
 

 



 

International Business Employee made pursuant to this _Section 8.3(c)_ is at
a job location that increases such International Business Employees commute
by more than 35 miles when compared to the commute from such International
Business Employees residence to the job location to which such employee
reports immediately prior to Closing, and such International Business Employee
becomes entitled to any severance or similar payments or benefits from Seller
Parent or its Affiliates in connection with a related termination of
employment or change in job location, Buyer shall reimburse Seller Parent and
its Affiliates for any and all such payments and benefits.

 



 

(d) For a period of at least one year following the Closing Date, each
Continuing Employee shall be entitled to receive while in the employment of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates total direct compensation of substantially
equivalent value to the total direct compensation provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of this _Section
8.3(d)_, "total direct compensation" means all cash compensation, including
base salary and wages (increased, with respect to Continuing Employees in
India, by the average annual non-performance-based salary increase applicable
for such Continuing Employees job location and increased, with respect to
each U.S. Business Employee, by any annual increase in salary or wage rate
that is communicated to such U.S. Business Employee prior to Closing), salary
premiums (including any performance differentiation award), gratuities and
bonus opportunities, but excluding equity and long-term compensation
incentives. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to continue to employ any
Continuing Employee for any specific period of time following the Closing
Date, subject to applicable Requirements of Law.

 



 

(e) _Buyer Benefit Plans_. For a period of at least one year following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer to, provide
Continuing Employees and, as applicable, their dependents with employee
benefits (other than defined benefit pension benefits, retiree health, retiree
life or other retiree welfare benefits, nonqualified deferred compensation
benefits or equity or equity-based benefits) that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to the employee benefits (other than defined benefit pension
benefits, retiree health, retiree life or other retiree welfare benefits,
nonqualified deferred compensation benefits or equity or equity-based
benefits) provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date under the "employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)
and other material employee benefit arrangements maintained by Seller Parent
or its Affiliates, including paid time off benefits, severance benefits
(including with respect to the terms and conditions under which severance
benefits are payable) and material fringe benefits and perquisites, but
excluding retiree medical benefits (other than the Canadian Supplemental
Benefits) and defined benefit pension benefits; _provided_ , that, for a
period of at least one year following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall
cause an Affiliate of Buyer to, provide the Continuing Employees who are
employed in India on terms and conditions of employment that are no less
favorable than those that were enjoyed by such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the
determination of whether such benefits are substantially comparable shall take
into account, among other things, the aggregate premium costs to the
Continuing Employees of receiving such benefits; provided, however, that any
increase in the premium cost to the Continuing Employees that results from an
ordinary course change associated with (i) annual increases in the cost of
coverage, or (ii) increases in the

 



      
 

 



 

cost of coverage to reflect the relative smaller population of employees of
Buyer and its Affiliates as compared to Seller Parent and its Affiliates, in
either case, where such increase to Continuing Employees costs is consistent
with, and proportional to (including with respect to the portion of any such
increase that is borne by Buyer or its Affiliates and the Continuing
Employees, respectively) such increases, shall not be considered for purposes
of determining whether Buyer or its Affiliates have satisfied their
obligations with respect to the foregoing comparability requirement of this
_Section 8.3(e)_. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 8.3_
shall require Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer to establish or maintain any
retiree welfare benefits of any type or a defined benefit pension plan for the
Continuing Employees or otherwise. During the Transition Services Period (or
the Canada Business Employee Services Period, as applicable), any change in
the benefits provided to Continuing Employees from Seller Parent or its
Affiliates pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement (or the
Canada Business Employee Services Agreement, as applicable) shall not be
considered for purposes of determining whether Buyer or its Affiliates have
satisfied their obligations with respect to the foregoing comparability
requirement of this _Section 8.3(e)_. Buyer agrees that it will, or will
cause its Affiliates to, honor the terms of each retention agreement or plan
set forth on _Section 5.19(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(f) _Buyer Severance Arrangements_. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to
the contrary, following the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to, or to cause its
Affiliates to, provide severance benefits to any Continuing Employee who
experiences an involuntary termination of employment during the one-year
period beginning on the Closing Date in an amount that is at least equal to
the severance benefits that would have been paid to such employee, and in
circumstances in which such severance benefits would have been provided,
pursuant to the terms of Requirements of Law and of the applicable layoff or
severance plan or arrangement maintained by Seller Parent or one of its
Affiliates as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date as applicable to
such Continuing Employee and as set forth on _Schedule 8.3(f)_ , to be
calculated, however, on the basis of the employees compensation and service
(calculated taking into account _Section 8.3(h)_) at the time of the
termination of employment. For purposes of the foregoing, if Buyer or its
Affiliates require an Continuing Employee to relocate more than (i) 50 miles
in the case of a U.S. Business Employee or (ii) 35 miles in the case of an
International Business Employee, and such Continuing Employee resigns, then
such resignation shall be treated as an "involuntary termination of employment
(for reasons other than cause)."

 



 

(g) _Seller Parent Benefit Plans_. Effective as of the Closing Date, except
as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the Canada Business
Employee Services Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement, all
Continuing Employees will cease any participation in, and any benefit accrual
under, any Seller Parent Benefit Plan.

 



 

(h) _Credit for Service_. To the extent that service is relevant for purposes
of eligibility, benefit accrual and vesting (including, in order to calculate
the amount of any paid time off and leave balance (including vacation and sick
days), gratuities, severance and similar benefits, but, unless required by
applicable Requirements of Law, not for purposes of defined benefit pension
benefit accruals) under any retirement plan or other employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement established or maintained by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates for the benefit of the Continuing Employees following the Closing
Date, such plan, program or

 



      
 

 



 

arrangement shall credit such Continuing Employees for service earned on and
prior to the Closing Date with the Business Subsidiaries, any Selling Party,
or any of their Affiliates or any of their predecessors to the same extent
such service was recognized under a corresponding Seller Parent Benefit Plan
for the same purpose immediately prior to the Closing Date and provided that
such credit would not result in a duplication of benefits or compensation.

 



 

(i) _Preexisting Conditions; Coordination_. Following the lapse of the
Transition Services Period (or in respect of Canada Business Employees, the
Canada Business Employee Services Period), Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, with respect to the remainder of the calendar year in which the
Transition Services Period lapses (or the Canada Business Employee Services
Period lapses), use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any waiting
periods and actively at work or evidence of insurability requirements and any
limitations on eligibility, enrollment and benefits relating to any
preexisting medical conditions of Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents under the medical and pharmacy plans maintained by Buyer or on of
its Affiliates in which the U.S. Business Employees or the Canada Business
Employees who are Continuing Employees are eligible to participate (the " **
_Buyer Plans_** "), except to the extent such waiting periods, requirements,
limitations or conditions would have applied to such individual under the
corresponding Seller Parent Benefit Plans or applicable Business Subsidiary
Plans immediately prior to the Closing; and (ii) recognize, for purposes of
annual deductible and out of pocket limits under the Buyer Plans, deductible
and out of pocket expenses paid by such Continuing Employees and their
respective dependents under the Seller Parent Benefit Plans or applicable
Business Subsidiary Plans that are medical and pharmacy plans in the portion
of the calendar year prior to the Closing Date to the extent such Continuing
Employees participate in any such Buyer Plans in such same calendar year.

 



 

(j) _Paid-Time Off_. For a period of at least one year following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide paid-time off
programs for the benefit of Continuing Employees that are at least as
favorable as the paid-time off programs made available to the Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall, or shall cause
its Affiliates to, recognize and provide all accrued but unused paid-time off
of each such Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date in accordance with
applicable Requirements of Law, and if not so required under applicable
Requirements of Law, to the extent such accrued and unpaid time off is
reflected on the Closing Working Capital. Unless required by applicable
Requirements of Law, neither Seller Parent nor its Affiliates shall have any
obligation or liability to pay or provide any payments in respect of paid-time
off for Continuing Employees on or after the Closing Date to the extent such
accrued and unpaid time off is reflected on the Closing Working Capital.

 



 

(k) _Bonuses_. Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, pay to each
Continuing Employee the bonus amounts such Continuing Employee earns for the
2016 calendar year under the bonus programs maintained by Seller Parent or its
Affiliates, as determined in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, and pursuant to the terms of the applicable bonus programs, for
such Continuing Employee pursuant to the terms of such bonus programs, but
only to the extent such amounts have not been paid prior to the Closing Date
and are treated as Closing Indebtedness.

 



       
 

 



 

(l) _Flexible Spending Account Program_. Effective on or before the Closing
Date, Seller Parent will cause one of the Business Subsidiaries to adopt a
cafeteria plan that includes a healthcare flexible spending account program
and a dependent care flexible spending account program (the " ** _Business
Subsidiary FSA_** ") that is substantially similar to Seller Parent Benefit
Plan that includes a healthcare flexible spending account program and a
dependent care flexible spending account program (the " ** _Seller Parent
FSA_** "). Buyer shall, or shall cause the applicable Business Subsidiary or
an Affiliate of Buyer to, maintain the Business Subsidiary FSA for the
remainder of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs for each U.S.
Business Employee that becomes a Continuing Employee who, in the portion of
the calendar year on or prior to the Closing Date, contributed to the Seller
Parent FSA. The beginning balance as of the Closing Date in the Business
Subsidiary FSA for each Continuing Employees healthcare spending account and
dependent care flexible spending account, as applicable, shall be the unused
portion of the Continuing Employees balance in the applicable healthcare
spending account and dependent care flexible spending account under the Seller
Parent FSA. If the aggregate amount withheld from Continuing Employees
compensation under the Seller Parent FSA for the 2017 plan year exceeds the
aggregate amount of reimbursements paid to Continuing Employees prior to the
Closing Date under the Seller Parent FSA for such plan year, Seller Parent
shall transfer (or cause to be transferred) to Buyer within thirty (30) days
after the Closing Date a cash payment equal to such excess, if any. If the
aggregate amount of reimbursements paid to Continuing Employees under the
Seller Parent FSA prior to the Closing Date for the 2017 plan year exceeds the
aggregate amount withheld prior to the Closing Date from Continuing Employees
compensation under the Seller Parent FSA for such plan year, Buyer shall
transfer to Seller Parent within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date a
cash payment equal to such excess, if any. Buyer and Seller Parent intend that
the actions to be taken pursuant to this _Section 8.3(l)_ be treated as an
assumption by Buyer of the portion of the Seller Parent FSA and the elections
made thereunder attributable to such Continuing Employees consistent with
Revenue Ruling 2002-32. Except as otherwise provided in the Transition
Services Agreement, the applicable Business Subsidiary maintaining the
Business Subsidiary FSA shall assume and be solely responsible for all claims
for reimbursement by Continuing Employees under the terms of the Business
Subsidiary FSA, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that
have not been paid in full as of the Closing Date, which claims shall be paid
pursuant to and under the terms of the Business Subsidiary FSA.

 



 

(m) _Defined Contribution Plan Transfers_. Seller Parent and Buyer agree to
(i) cooperate in good faith to cause one of the Business Subsidiaries to adopt
a defined contribution retirement plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code (the " ** _Business Subsidiary 401(k) Plan_**")
and that is substantially similar to the Aon Savings Plan (the " ** _Seller
Parent Savings Plan_** "), which shall be effective on or as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and (ii) on or as soon as
reasonably practicable following the effective date of the Business Subsidiary
401(k) Plan, cause the account balances of the Continuing Employees and
associated liabilities to be transferred from the Seller Parent Savings Plan
to the Business Subsidiary 401(k) Plan. Except with respect to the Aon Stock
Fund, such transfer shall be an in-kind transfer of the assets in the
Continuing Employees accounts under the Seller Parent Savings Plan; provided,
however, that, upon Buyers request, Seller Parent agrees to consider in good
faith the feasibility of liquidating the Continuing Employees account
balances prior to such transfer (taking into account, among other things, the
obligations of Seller

 



      
 

 



 

Parent and its Affiliates under the Transition Services Agreement). The
parties shall consider in good faith whether the foregoing transfer of
Continuing Employees account balances shall be effectuated as a "spin-off",
"trust to trust transfer" or otherwise, provided that any such approach shall
be in compliance with the applicable Requirements of Law. Seller Parent
agrees that (x) such Business Subsidiary 401(k) Plan shall not at any time
prior to the Closing Date (or the transfer of assets described in clause (ii)
above, if later) include the Aon Stock Fund as an investment option and (ii)
no assets held in the Aon Stock Fund or the stock of Seller Parent or any of
its Affiliates shall be transferred from the Seller Parent Savings Plan to the
Business Subsidiary 401(k) Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, (A) the
foregoing shall not preclude assets that have been liquidated from the Aon
Stock Fund and are then in the form of cash or other securities from being
transferred from the Seller Parent Savings Plan to the Business Subsidiary
401(k) Plan, (B) liabilities under any qualified domestic relations orders (as
defined in Section 414(p) of the Code) received with respect to any Continuing
Employees accounts transferred to the Business Subsidiary 401(k) Plan shall
be transferred to and assumed by the Business Subsidiary 401(k) Plan at the
time such assets attributable to such accounts are transferred and (C) any
participant loan promissory notes attributable to Continuing Employees shall
be transferred to the Buyer Subsidiary 401(k) Plan in connection with such
transfer.

 



 

(n) _Seller Parent Deferred Compensation Plans_. From and after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall assume all obligations of Seller Parent and its Affiliates
with respect to benefits currently provided with respect to Continuing
Employees under the Aon Deferred Compensation Plan and the Aon Supplemental
Savings Plan (collectively, the " ** _Seller Parent Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Plans_** "). Buyer shall satisfy such obligations in a manner
consistent with the terms of such Seller Parent Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Plans and Section 409A of the Code. Following the Closing Date,
except as otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement, neither
Seller Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall have any liability for the
Seller Parent Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans with respect to
Continuing Employees under such plans.

 



 

(o) _Business Subsidiary Deferred Compensation Plan_. From and after the
Closing Date, Seller Parent shall assume all obligations of the Business
Subsidiaries with respect to benefits currently provided with respect to any
individual who is not a Continuing Employee under the Hewitt Associates, Inc.
Voluntary Deferral Plan (the " ** _Business Subsidiary Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Plan_** "). Seller Parent shall satisfy such obligations in a
manner consistent with the terms of such Business Subsidiary Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan and Section 409A of the Code. Following the Closing
Date, no Business Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates shall have any
liability for the Business Subsidiary Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans
with respect to any individual that is not a Continuing Employee under such
plan.

 



 

(p) _COBRA_. Following the end of the period that Continuing Employees
continue to receive benefits under the Seller Parent Benefit Plans pursuant to
the terms of the Transition Services Agreement (such period, the " **
_Transition Services Period_** "), Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate
to, provide continuation health care coverage to all Continuing Employees and
their qualified beneficiaries, regardless of when a "qualifying event" occurs,
in accordance with the continuation health care coverage requirements of
Section 4980B of the

 



      
 

 



 

Code and Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA (" ** _COBRA_** ") with respect
to claims incurred at any time on or after the end of the Transition Services
Period. Seller Parent shall be solely responsible for any and all obligations
under COBRA with respect to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9 other than any Continuing Employee with
respect to any period following the Transition Services Period.

 



 

(q) _WARN_. Prior to the Closing, with respect to each facility at which a
Continuing Employee is employed, Seller Parent shall provide to Buyer a true
and correct list of the names of each U.S. Business Employee who experienced,
or will experience, an employment loss or layoff under the WARN Act within the
ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date, and shall update this list up to
and including the Closing Date. Subject to the foregoing, Buyer shall be
responsible for all liabilities or obligations under the WARN Act that are
incurred following the Closing with respect to the Continuing Employees.
Seller Parent shall be responsible for all liabilities or obligations under
the WARN Act and similar provincial, state and local rules, statutes,
ordinances or other Requirements of Law solely resulting from Seller Parents
or its Affiliates actions on or prior to the Closing with respect to all
Business Employees.

 



 

(r) _Workers  Compensation Liabilities_. As of the Closing Date, Buyer will
assume, cause its Affiliate to assume, or reimburse Seller Parent for, all
liabilities and obligations relating to compensation and benefits under any
state workers compensation or similar Requirement of Law payable following
the Closing Date to or with respect to any current or former U.S. Business
Employee who was providing services primarily to or on behalf of the Business
on the date the claim arose or the incident on which the claim is based
occurred.

 



 

(s) _Defined Contribution Pension Asset Transfers (Canada)_. On Closing, Aon
Canada Inc. and Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) shall enter into an agreement
(the " ** _DC Asset Transfer Agreement_** ") that complies with the
Requirements of Law to effectuate a transfer of the defined contribution
account balances of each Canada Business Employee from the Canadian Pension
Plans to a registered pension plan(s) of the Buyer (or any of its Affiliates)
(the " ** _Buyer Canadian Pension Plan_** "). The parties to the DC Asset
Transfer Agreement agree to take such actions to effectuate the transfer after
Closing in accordance with the Requirements of Law and the terms of the DC
Asset Transfer Agreement. The Buyer Canadian Pension Plan shall assume and
thereafter be solely responsible for all then existing and future employer
obligations related to Canadian Business Employees under the Buyer Canadian
Pension Plan and the administration thereof, and neither Seller Parent nor any
of its Affiliates shall have any liability therefor.

 



 

(t) _Canadian Supplemental Retirement Benefits_. From and after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall assume all obligations of Seller Parent and its Affiliates
with respect to any and all supplemental retirement benefits being provided to
any Canada Business Employee under a Seller Benefit Plan, including the Aon
Canada, Inc. Defined Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (such benefits, the
" ** _Canadian Supplemental Benefits_** "). Buyer shall satisfy such
obligations in a manner consistent with the terms of any Seller Benefit Plan
that provides for the Canadian Supplemental Benefits and the Requirements of
Law. Following the Closing Date, neither Seller Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any liability for the Canadian Supplemental Benefits.

 



      
 

 



 

(u) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This _Section 8.3_ and _Section 8.4_ of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 8.3_ or in
_Section 8.4_, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Business
Employee or any other Person (other than the parties to this Agreement) any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section 8.3_ or _Section 8.4_. Without limiting the generality of the
forgoing, no provision of this _Section 8.3_ or _Section 8.4_ shall create
any third party beneficiary rights in any Person in respect of continued
employment or any other matter. Nothing in this _Section 8.3_ or _Section
8.4_ will constitute a contract of employment (or guarantee any particular
term or condition of employment) or will give any Business Employee or any
other Person a right to be employed by or retained in the employ of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, and nothing shall be construed as (i) prohibiting or
limiting the ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement,
arrangement or Contract at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them, or (ii) the establishment of or an amendment to any
benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement, arrangement or
Contract.

 



 

Section 8.4 _International Employees_.

 



 

(a) _Automatic Transfer_. The parties acknowledge that the Transfer
Regulations will apply to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
pursuant to the Transfer Regulations the contracts of employment of the
Automatic Transfer Employees will have effect from the Closing Date as if
originally made between Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer and the Automatic
Transfer Employees, save in relation to the Automatic Transfer Employees
rights to old age invalidity or survivors benefits under any occupational
pension scheme and subject to any individual objecting to the transfer, and
all Seller Parents and its Affiliates rights, powers, duties and liabilities
in connection with such employment contracts shall transfer automatically to
Buyer or its Affiliates. If an Automatic Transfer Employee exercises his or
her right under the Transfer Regulations not to transfer to Buyer, Buyer shall
be responsible for any related termination or severance liability or costs
incurred by Seller Parent and its Affiliates.

 



 

(b) _Automatic Transfer Employee Collective Agreements and Employee Benefits_.
Buyer or its Affiliates (as applicable) shall continue to observe the terms of
any collective agreements or other similar agreements that applied to the
Automatic Transfer Employees employment before the Closing Date. Buyer or its
Affiliates (as applicable) shall provide employee benefits to the Automatic
Transfer Employees that are substantially the same benefits (and no less
favorable) as those provided to the Automatic Transfer Employees by Seller
Parent and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Remaining Automatic Transfer Employees_. If, following the Closing Date,
it is established to the reasonable satisfaction of Seller Parent and Buyer
that the contract of employment or employment (as applicable) of an Automatic
Transfer Employee did not transfer in accordance with the Transfer Regulations
(such an Automatic Transfer Employee, a " ** _Remaining Automatic Transfer
Employee_** "), then:

 



 

(i) Buyer, or its applicable Affiliate, in consultation with Seller Parent,
shall as soon as reasonably possible but in any event within fourteen (14)
business days of being so requested by Seller Parent or its Affiliates, make
to each such Remaining Automatic Transfer Employee an offer in writing to
employ him/her on the terms and

 



      
 

 



 

conditions which would have applied in accordance with applicable Requirements
of Law and the terms of this Agreement had the employment of such person
transferred automatically and such Remaining Automatic Transfer Employee shall
be treated as an Automatic Transfer Employee for the purposes of this
Agreement;

 



 

(ii) upon acceptance of the offer made pursuant to _Section 8.4(c)(i)_ above,
or in the event an offer of employment was: (i) not made in accordance with
_Section 8.4(c)(i)_ above, on the expiry of the fourteen (14) day period or
(ii) not accepted, on the expiry of a fourteen (14) day period commencing on
the date of such offer, Seller Parent or its Affiliate will terminate the
employment of any Remaining Automatic Transfer Employee concerned with
immediate effect and without notice, unless otherwise required by applicable
Requirements of Law; and

 



 

(iii) Buyer or its applicable Affiliate shall indemnify Seller Parent and its
Affiliates against any Losses arising out of or in connection with the
employment and/or termination of the contract of employment of any Remaining
Automatic Transfer Employee.

 



 

(d) _Undisclosed Employees_. If, following the Closing Date, any contract of
employment of a person who is not an Automatic Transfer Employee has effect or
is alleged to have effect as if originally made between Buyer and that person
pursuant to the Transfer Regulations (" ** _Undisclosed Employee_** "), then:

 



 

(i) Buyer or its applicable Affiliate, may, within twenty-one (21) business
days of becoming aware of such contract having (or being alleged to have)
effect as if originally made by it and such person, terminate such contract
immediately without notice, unless otherwise required by applicable
Requirements of Law;

 



 

(ii) Buyer shall advise Seller Parent or its applicable Affiliate of its
intention to notify such Undisclosed Employee of the termination of his/her
employment as soon as reasonably possible but in any event within fourteen
(14) business days prior to giving the Undisclosed Employee such notice;

 



 

(iii) Seller Parent or its Affiliates shall offer such Undisclosed Employee
employment on terms identical to those upon which he or she was previously
employed by Seller Parent or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing
Date;

 



 

(iv) if Buyer or its applicable Affiliate does not terminate the contract of
employment of any Undisclosed Employee in accordance with this _Section
8.4(d)_, any Undisclosed Employee shall be treated as an Automatic Transfer
Employee for the purposes of this Agreement; and

 



 

(v) provided Buyer or its applicable Affiliate terminates the employment of
any Undisclosed Employee within twenty-one (21) business days of becoming
aware of an Undisclosed Employee and complies with _Section 8.4(d)(ii)_
above, Seller Parent shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates against any
Losses arising out of or in connection with the employment and/or termination
of employment of such Undisclosed Employee.

_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein
will restrict or preclude the right of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates
(i) to make generalized searches for employees by use of advertisements in any
medium for such purposes, recruiting agencies, web searches or other general
forms of solicitations, so long as such advertisements or solicitations are
not targeted or focused upon Continuing Employees or hire, employ or retain
any person who responds to such ads or solicitations, or (ii) hire, retain,
solicit or employ any person who has been terminated by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates at least twelve (12) months (with respect to any senior executive

Affiliates or to the business or business reputation of the other party or any
of its Affiliates.

 



 

(i) Each of Seller Parent and Buyer acknowledges and agrees that in the event
Buyer or Seller Parent violates any of its obligations under this _Section
8.7_, Seller Parent or Buyer, respectively may proceed against the other in
law or in equity for such damages or other relief as a court may deem
appropriate. Each of Buyer and Seller Parent acknowledges that a violation of
this _Section 8.7 _would cause the other irreparable harm which may not be
adequately compensated for by money damages. Each of Seller Parent and Buyer
therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or threatened violation of
this _Section 8.7_, Seller Parent and Buyer, as applicable shall be entitled,
in addition to other remedies that they may have, to a temporary restraining
order and to preliminary and final injunctive relief against the other to
prevent any violations of this _Section 8.7_, without the necessity of
posting a bond.

 



 

(j) If at any time any of the provisions of this _Section 8.7_ shall be
determined to be invalid or unenforceable by reason of being vague or
unreasonable as to duration, area or scope of activity, or otherwise, then
this _Section 8.7_ shall be considered divisible (with the other provisions
to remain in full force and effect) and the invalid or unenforceable
provisions shall become and be deemed to be immediately amended to include
only such time, area, scope of activity and other restrictions as shall be
determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the court or other body having
jurisdiction over the matter, and the Parties hereto expressly agree

 



      
 

 



 

that this Agreement, as so amended, shall be valid and binding as though any
invalid or unenforceable provision had not been included herein. Without
limiting the foregoing, if the length of the Non-Competition Period is
determined to be unacceptable under applicable Requirements of Law in any
applicable jurisdiction, the Non-Competition Period shall be modified in
relation to such jurisdiction as determined by a court or other agency of
competent jurisdiction or statute, as applicable, to be of the maximum length
permitted under Requirements of Law in such jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Release of Guaranties_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause Seller Parent
and its Affiliates (including the Selling Parties) to be fully and irrevocably
released, as of the Closing Date or as promptly as practicable after the

of credit, letters of comfort, bid bonds or performance or surety bonds or
cash or other collateral obtained or given by Seller Parent or its Affiliates
(including the Selling Parties) relating to the Business Subsidiaries, the
Business or any Purchased Asset and (ii) in respect of any Assumed Liabilities
(including as a result of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates remaining
directly or indirectly liable for, or otherwise having credit exposure with
respect to, any Assumed Liabilities) (collectively, the " ** _Seller Parent
Guaranties_** "); _provided_ that the foregoing shall not require Buyer or any
of its Affiliates to make any payment to such guarantor. If Buyer is unable to
effect such a substitution and release with respect to any Seller Parent
Guarantee, Buyer shall indemnify Seller Parent and each Selling Party against
any and all Loss or Expense arising from such Seller Parent Guarantee;
_provided_ that the foregoing obligation of Buyer to indemnify Seller Parent
and the Selling Parties shall expressly exclude any Losses and Expenses for
which Seller Parent is required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)_. Without limiting the foregoing, after the
Closing Date, Buyer will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates,
successors or assigns to, (A) renew, extend, amend or supplement any Contract
or otherwise extend the term of or increase any obligation that is covered by
or the subject of a Seller Parent Guarantee (provided that the restrictions in
this sentence shall not prohibit (1) renewals that occur automatically under
any Contract and (2) ordinary course amendments or modifications to parts of
any Contract which are permitted under the existing terms thereof (e.g.,
updating statements of work, amending pricing or product delivery schedules,
adding more products/services, etc.)), (B) transfer to a Third Party any such
Contract or other obligation or (C) obtain a release from all obligations
under such Contract or other obligation contemplated by clause (A) or (B),

that the Seller Parent Guarantee has been irrevocably and fully irrevocably
released. Any cash or other collateral posted by Seller Parent or its
Affiliates (including the Selling Parties) in respect of any Seller Parent
Guarantee shall be delivered to Seller Parent promptly following such release
to the extent not included in the Final Cash Amount. For so long as any of
Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates has not been fully irrevocably released
from, remains directly or indirectly liable for, or has any credit exposure
with respect to, any of the Seller Parent Guaranties, Buyer shall promptly
upon written request of Seller Parent, (x) provide Seller Parent with any
update on the status of any outstanding Seller Parent Guaranty and (y) inform
Seller Parent of any claims by or disputes with any Third Party in connection
with, or that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any liability or
obligation of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates under, any Seller Parent
Guarantee

 



      
 

 



 

and the reasons for such claim or dispute (including by promptly providing
Seller Parent with copies of any correspondence or other written materials
received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates relating to any such claim or
dispute). Within 60 days after the end of each calendar quarter, Buyer shall
deliver to Seller Parent a list of all claims and disputes arising during such
calendar quarter under any Contract that is guaranteed by, the subject of, or
under which Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates may have any liability or
credit exposure as a result of, any Seller Parent Guarantee.

 



 

(b) Following Closing and for so long as actual or potential obligations
remain outstanding under the Seller Parent Guaranties, in the event that the
initial credit rating (" ** _Credit Rating_** ") in respect of any of the
Facilities or the Senior Notes (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letters) of
any nationally recognized credit rating agency is lowered one notch or more (a
" ** _Credit Downgrade_** "), then, from the date of such Credit Downgrade
through the date the Credit Rating is restored to its pre-existing level,
Buyer shall promptly upon written request of Seller Parent (i) deliver to
Seller Parent copies of the all of the most recent financial information
required to be delivered to the Lenders under the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements (as the same may be amended, supplemented or replaced after
Closing, the " ** _Lender Required Information_** "), and (ii) thereafter
deliver, in accordance with the deadlines specified in the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements after the end of each calendar quarter, the Lender
Required Information for such period.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the fees
and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, shall be
paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement (including _Section 7.3(b)_).

 



 

Section 8.10 _Intellectual Property Cross License Agreement_. With respect to
the licensing of Intellectual Property, concurrently with the Closing, Seller
Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, and Buyer shall enter into the

_Exhibit I_ to this Agreement (the " ** _Intellectual Property Cross License
Agreement_** ").

 



 

Section 8.11 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, each Business Subsidiary shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement under its existing directors and officers
liability insurance coverage (the " ** _D andO Policy_**") for its respective
current or former directors, managers and officers (the " ** _D andO Indemnified
Parties_**"). During the six (6) year period following the Closing, Buyer
shall maintain the "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to
honor their respective obligations thereunder.

 



 

(b) In addition, for a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall (and shall cause each Business Subsidiary to) cause the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational
documents) of such Business Subsidiary to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable as the

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of such
Business Subsidiary immediately prior to the date hereof, and during such six
(6) year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the DandO Indemnified
Parties, except as required by applicable Requirements of Law.

 



 

(c) The obligations of Buyer under this _Section 8.11_ shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to materially or
adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party (or any other Person who is a
beneficiary under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section
8.11(a)_ above (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior
written consent of such affected DandO Indemnified Party or other person who is
a beneficiary under the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 8.11(a)_ above
(and their heirs and representatives). Each of the DandO Indemnified Parties or
other Persons who are beneficiaries under the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section 8.11(a)_ above (and their heirs and representatives) are intended
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 8.11(a)_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party to this Agreement.

Business Subsidiaries set forth on _Schedule 8.12_ to, comply with the
provisions of the Prior Transaction Agreements set forth opposite such
Business Subsidiaries on _Schedule 8.12_ as if Buyer and such Business
Subsidiaries were parties to the Prior Transaction Agreements.

 



 

Section 8.13 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as each party
hereto actively is prosecuting, contesting or defending any proceeding, claim
or demand by a Third Party (other than a claim or demand for which such party
seeks indemnification hereunder) in connection with (a) any transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act, or transaction involving the Business or the Business
Subsidiaries, and any of the foregoing require the other partys cooperation
due to such partys ownership of the Business or the Business Subsidiaries at

expenses, in the prosecution, contest or defense, make reasonably available
during normal business hours upon reasonable advanced notice its personnel,
and provide such testimony and reasonable access during normal business hours
upon reasonable advanced notice to its books and records as shall be
reasonably necessary in connection with the prosecution, contest or defense,

no party shall be required to violate any Requirements of Law, Governmental
Order or obligation of confidentiality to which such party is subject or to
waive any privilege which any of them may possess in discharging obligations
pursuant to this _Section 8.13_; _provided_ , _further_ , no party shall be
required to furnish or otherwise make available to the other party
competitively sensitive information relating to areas of such partys business
in which the other party competes against such party; and, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that neither any party nor any of its officers, employees, agents
or representatives shall have access to any personnel of the other party or

 _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller Parent shall be required to indemnify
and hold harmless under _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ with respect to Losses and

(w) the amount of Loss and Expense suffered by Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ related to each individual claim or series

(x) the aggregate amount of such Losses and Expenses (including Losses and
Expenses excluded by clause (w) above) suffered by Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ exceeds $43,000,000 (it being understood
that such amount shall be a deductible for which Seller Parent shall bear no
indemnification responsibility); _provided_ , that, this clause (x) shall not
apply to any Losses and Expenses suffered by Buyer Indemnified Parties in
connection with the breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any
representation of Seller Parent contained in _Section 5.10(c)_, _Section
5.12_ or _Section 5.13_;

 



 

(y) solely with respect to recovery under _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ in connection
with the breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of

5.13_, the aggregate amount of such Losses and Expenses (including Losses and
Expenses excluded by clause (w) above) suffered by Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i) in connection with the breach of any warranty
or the inaccuracy of any representation of Seller Parent contained in
_Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _5.10(c)_ , _Section 5.12_ or _Section 5.13_ exceeds (A) $10,750,000 (it
being understood that such amount shall be a deductible for which Seller
Parent shall bear no indemnification responsibility) or, (B) together with the
aggregate amount of such Losses and Expenses (including Losses and Expenses
excluded by clause (w) above) suffered by Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant
to _Section 11.1(a)(i),_ $43,000,000 (it being understood that such amount
shall be a deductible for which Seller Parent shall bear no indemnification
responsibility);

 



 

(z) the aggregate amount required to be paid by Seller Parent pursuant to
_Section 11.1(a)(i)_ shall not exceed $258,000,000;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing clauses (w), (x), (y) and (z) shall
not apply to any Losses and Expenses suffered by Buyer Indemnified Parties (A)
in connection with the breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any
representation of Seller Parent contained in _Section 5.1_, _Section 5.2_,
_Section 5.3(a)_, _Section 5.6_, _Section 5.21_ or _Section 5.23_, for
which the aggregate amount to be paid by Seller Parent, together with all
other amounts paid by Seller Parent pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ and
_Section 11.1(a)(ii)_ shall not exceed the Purchase Price or (B) that arise
out of actual and intentional fraud by or on behalf of Seller Parent or any
Selling Party in connection with this Agreement;

 



 

(b) The indemnification provided for in _Section 11.1(a)_ (excluding _Section
11.1(a)(iv)_, _Section 11.1(a)(v)_ and _Section 11.1(a)(vi)_, which shall
survive indefinitely) shall terminate fifteen (15) months after the Closing
Date (and no claims shall be made by Buyer under _Section 11.1(a)_
thereafter), except that the indemnification by Seller Parent shall continue
as to:

 



 

(i) the representations and warranties of Seller Parent set forth in _Section
5.1_, _Section 5.2_, _Section 5.3(a)_, _Section 5.6_ and _Section 5.21_
and the covenants of Seller Parent set forth in _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_
and _Section 8.4_, each of which shall terminate seven (7) years after the
Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) the covenants of Seller Parent which by their terms extend beyond fifteen
(15) months, which shall survive until expiring in accordance with their
respective terms; and

 



 

(iii) any Losses or Expenses of which Buyer has validly given a Claim Notice
to Seller Parent in accordance with the requirements of _Section 11.3_ on or
prior to the date such indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance
with this _Section 11.1_, as to which the obligation of Seller Parent shall
continue solely with respect to the specific matters in each such Claim Notice
until the liability of Seller Parent shall have been determined pursuant to
this _ARTICLE XI_, and Seller Parent shall have reimbursed Buyer for the full
amount of such Losses and Expenses that are payable with respect to such Claim
Notice in accordance with this _ARTICLE XI_.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification obligations pursuant to
_Section 11.1(a)(iv)_, _Section 11.1(a)(v)_ and _Section 11.1(a)(vi)_
represent the parties intention to

 



       
 

 



 

allocate certain liabilities and obligations and are not claims for breach in
any respect, thus the parties intend for such provision to survive
indefinitely.

 



 

(c) For purposes of determining any breach or inaccuracy of any representation
under _ARTICLE V_ (other than _Section 5.4_, the first sentence of _Section
5.5_, _Section 5.15_ and references to "Material Clients" and "Material
Vendors") and the amount of any Losses and Expenses under _Section
11.1(a)(i)_, all qualifications and limitations as to materiality, Material
Adverse Effect and other similar materiality qualifiers set forth in _ARTICLE
V_ shall be disregarded.

 



 

Section 11.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
Seller Parent from and against, and will pay and reimburse Seller Parent for,
any and all Losses and Expenses incurred by Seller Parent, any of its
Affiliates and any of their respective officers, directors or managers (the "
** _Seller Parent Indemnified Parties_** "; for the avoidance of doubt, Seller
Parent (and only Seller Parent) shall be permitted to bring a claim on behalf
of any Seller Parent Indemnified Party under this _Section 11.2_), resulting
from or arising out of:

 



 

(i) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of
Buyer contained in this Agreement or the certificate delivered by or on behalf
of Buyer pursuant to _Section 10.5_;

 



 

(ii) any breach by Buyer of, or failure by Buyer to perform, any of its
covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) any Assumed Liability or the failure by Buyer to pay for or discharge
any Assumed Liabilities (other than any Assumed Liability described in
_Section 2.3(a)(x)_, which shall be governed exclusively by _Section 8.2_)
and Buyers or any of its Subsidiaries operation of the Business following
the Closing (in each case, expressly excluding any Losses and Expenses for
which Seller Parent is required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 11.1(a)(ii)_ above);

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall be required to indemnify and hold
harmless under _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ with respect to Losses and Expenses
incurred by any Seller Parent Indemnified Party only to the extent that:

 



 

(x) the amount of Loss and Expense suffered by Seller Parent Indemnified
Parties pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ related to each individual claim or
series of related claims exceeds $200,000 (it being understood that such
$200,000 shall be a basket and once exceeded, Buyer shall bear indemnification
responsibility back to the first dollar);

 



 

(y) the aggregate amount of such Losses and Expenses (including Losses and
Expenses excluded by clause (x) above) suffered by Seller Parent Indemnified
Parties pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ exceeds $43,000,000 (it being
understood that such amount shall be a deductible for which Buyer shall bear
no indemnification responsibility); and

 



      
 

 



 

(z) the aggregate amount required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to _Section
11.2(a)(i)_ shall not exceed $258,000,000;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing clauses (x), (y) and (z) shall not
apply to any Losses and Expenses suffered by Seller Parent Indemnified Parties
(A) in connection with the breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any
representation of Buyer contained in _Section 6.1_, _Section 6.2(a)_ or
_Section 6.9_, for which the aggregate amount to be paid by Buyer, together
with all other amounts paid by Buyer pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ or
_Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ shall not exceed the Purchase Price or (B) that arise
out of actual and intentional fraud by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The indemnification provided for in _Section 11.2(a)_ (excluding _Section
11.2(a)(iii)_ which shall survive indefinitely) shall terminate 15 months
after the Closing Date (and no claims shall be made by Seller Parent under
_Section 11.2(a)_ thereafter), except that the indemnification by Buyer shall
continue as to:

 



 

(i) the covenants of Buyer set forth in _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and
_Section 8.4_, which shall terminate seven (7) years after the Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) the covenants of Buyer which by their terms extend beyond 15 months
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the obligations under _Section 4.7_),
which shall survive until expiring in accordance with their respective terms;
and

 



 

(iii) any Losses or Expenses of which Seller Parent has validly given a Claim
Notice to Buyer in accordance with the requirements of _Section 11.3_ on or
prior to the date such indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance
with this _Section 11.2_, as to which the obligation of Buyer shall continue
solely with respect to the specific matters in each such Claim Notice until
the liability of Buyer shall have been determined pursuant to this _ARTICLE
XI_, and Buyer shall have reimbursed Seller Parent for the full amount of such
Losses and Expenses that are payable with respect to such Claim Notice in
accordance with this _ARTICLE XI_.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification obligations pursuant to
_Section 11.2(a)(iii)_ represents the parties intention to allocate certain
liabilities and obligations and are not claims for breach in any respect, thus
the parties intend for such provision to survive indefinitely.

 



 

(c) For purposes of determining any breach or inaccuracy of any representation
under _ARTICLE VI_ and the amount of any Losses and Expenses under _Section
11.2(a)(i)_, all qualifications and limitations as to materiality, Material
Adverse Effect and other similar materiality qualifiers set forth in _ARTICLE
VI_ shall be disregarded.

 



 

Section 11.3 _Notice of Claims_. Buyer or Seller Parent seeking
indemnification hereunder (the " ** _Indemnified Party_** ") shall give
promptly to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified
Party (the " ** _Indemnitor_** ") a notice (a " ** _Claim Notice_** ")
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for
indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then
known) the amount or the method of

 



      
 

 



 

computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of
this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument executed
hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based; _provided_
, _however_ , that a Claim Notice in respect of any action at law or suit in
equity by or against a third Person as to which indemnification will be sought
shall be given promptly after the action or suit is commenced. The failure to
give notice as provided in this _Section 11.3_ shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have
been materially prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

Section 11.4 _Determination of Amount_.

 



 

(a) In calculating any Loss or Expense, such amounts shall be net of any
third-party insurance, indemnification or other proceeds which have actually
been recovered by the Indemnified Party under any insurance policy (after
giving effect to any applicable deductible or retention and any premium
adjustments) or other contract, agreement or undertaking, in each case, in
connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification. An
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make such
recoveries.

 



 

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant to _Section 11.3_, the
amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled
under this _ARTICLE XI_ shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or
decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to
which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or
decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any,
shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals
taken shall have been finally determined.

 



 

(c) Buyer and Seller Parent agree to report each indemnification payment made
in respect of a Loss or Expense as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes, except as otherwise required by an applicable Requirement of Law.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Third Person Claims_.

 



 

(a) Any party seeking indemnification provided for under this Agreement in
respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any third
Person against the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnitor in writing,
and in reasonable detail, of the third Person claim within ten (10) business
days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the third
Person claim (and the Indemnified Partys being aware of the likelihood of an
indemnification claim hereunder). The failure to give notice as provided in
this _Section 11.5_ shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations
hereunder except to the extent it shall have been materially prejudiced by
such failure.

 



 

(b) In the event any legal proceeding shall be threatened or instituted or any
claim or demand shall be asserted by any Person in respect of which payment is
reasonably expected to be sought by one party hereto from the other party
under the provisions of this _ARTICLE XI_, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any such claim of which it
has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the
Indemnitor. Any notice of a claim by reason of any of the representations,
warranties or

 



      
 

 



 

covenants contained in this Agreement shall contain a reference to the
provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument
executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based,
the facts giving rise to an alleged basis for the claim and the amount of the
liability asserted against the Indemnitor by reason of the claim. In the event
of the initiation of any legal proceeding against the Indemnified Party by a
third Person in respect of which payment is reasonably expected to be sought
by one party hereto from the other party under the provisions of this _ARTICLE
XI_, the Indemnitor shall have 30 days from receipt of notice pursuant to
_Section 11.5(a)_ to give notice to assume the defense thereof; _provided_ ,
that as a condition to the assumption, the Indemnitor must acknowledge in
writing its obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party in the event that
such third Person claim is adversely determined and provide evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnitor has
sufficient resources to satisfy its indemnification obligation (which evidence
may consist solely of the most recent financial statements of Seller Parent
available on the SEC website). If notice to the effect set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence is given by the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor
shall have the right to assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against
the third Person claim with counsel of its choice and, subject to the terms of
this _Section 11.5(b)_, to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any proceeding, claim or demand which relates to any loss,
liability or damage indemnified against hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnified Party may participate in any such proceeding with counsel
of its choice and at its expense, except if the Indemnified Party concludes
based on the advice of outside counsel that a conflict of interest exists
between the Indemnitor and the Indemnified Party because the Indemnified Party
may have available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims that are
inconsistent with or additional to one or more of those that may be available
to the Indemnitor in respect of such third Person claim, in which case the
Indemnitor shall be liable for the fees and expenses of one firm of counsel
for the Indemnified Party. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with
each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any
such legal proceeding, claim or demand and to make available to the other
party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in such
partys possession or under such partys control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the other party. To the extent the Indemnitor (A)
elects not to defend such proceeding, claim or demand (including by failure to
deliver the acknowledgement of its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
Party in the event that such third Person claim is adversely determined or to
provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnitor has sufficient resources to satisfy its indemnification obligation
(which evidence may consist solely of the most recent financial statements of
Seller Parent available on the SEC website)) or (B) fails to contest in good
faith the third Person claim and the Indemnified Party defends against or
otherwise deals with any such proceeding, claim or demand, the Indemnified
Party may retain counsel, at the expense of the Indemnitor, and control the
defense of such proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 11.5_, the Indemnified Party (and not the Indemnitor) shall have the
exclusive right to assume the defense and control of any third Person claim if
(i) the Indemnified Party in good faith determines that the nature of the
third Person claim is such that it would reasonably be expected to involve
criminal liability being imposed on any Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
(but not the Indemnitor or any of its Affiliates), (ii) such claim seeks as
the sole remedy an injunction or other equitable relief against any
Indemnified Party or (iii) if it is reasonably likely that the Losses and
Expenses arising from such claim (if determined in any

 



      
 

 



 

manner) will exceed an amount equal to two times the amount the Indemnified
Party will be entitled to recover from the Indemnitor as a result of the
limitations set forth in this _ARTICLE XI_. Neither the Indemnitor nor the
Indemnified Party may settle any such proceeding which settlement obligates
the other party to pay money, to perform obligations, to agree to any
restrictions on its business or operations that would reasonably be expected
to result in material harm to the affected Person or to admit liability
without the consent of the other party. If the Indemnified Party shall refuse
to consent to the settlement of any third Person claim, so long as only money
damages payable by the Indemnitor are involved and there is no admission of
liability or wrongdoing with respect to the Indemnified Party, the liability
of the Indemnitor in respect of such third Person claim shall not exceed the
amount for which the third Person claim could have been settled plus the
amount of expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party prior to the time of and
in connection with the proposed settlement to which it is entitled to
indemnification. After any final judgment or award shall have been rendered by
a court, arbitration board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction
and the time in which to appeal therefrom has expired, or a settlement shall
have been consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall
arrive at a mutually binding agreement with respect to each separate matter
alleged to be indemnified by the Indemnitor hereunder, the Indemnified Party
shall forward to the Indemnitor notice of any sums due and owing by it with
respect to such matter and the Indemnitor shall pay all of the sums so owing
to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer, certified or bank cashiers check
within thirty (30) days after the date of such notice. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 11.5(b)_ to the contrary, Seller Parent shall have
the right to control and defend any Specified Litigation and to settle such
Specified Litigation without the consent of Buyer if such settlement is solely
for monetary damages. In the event a settlement of a Specified Litigation
involves relief other than monetary damages, including any injunctive or
equitable relief or any other non-monetary liability or obligation upon the
Business or Buyer or its Affiliates, Buyers consent shall be required, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (taking into
account the ongoing operations of the Business as it then exists).

 



 

(c) To the extent of any inconsistency between this _Section 11.5_ and
_Section 8.2(c)_ (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of _Section
8.2(c)_ shall control with respect to Tax contests.

 



 

Section 11.6 _Limitations_.

 



 

(a) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any
amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnitor has
indemnified it pursuant to this _ARTICLE XI_, such Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such
recovery and the costs of any premium increases as a result of such recovery),
but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid by the
Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter
and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnitor in pursuing or defending any
claim arising out of such matter.

 



 

(b) IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY (I) EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES OR (II) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR

 



      
 

 



 

CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF REVENUES OR PROFITS) DAMAGES OR DIMINUTION OF
VALUE OR ANY DAMAGES BASED ON ANY TYPE OF MULTIPLE, IN EACH CASE WHETHER
ARISING UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY OR ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED BY AGREEMENT OF THE
PARTIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, _PROVIDED_ THAT (X) IN ANY EVENT,
ANY SUCH TYPES OF DAMAGES SHALL BE RECOVERABLE TO THE EXTENT SUCH DAMAGES
CONSTITUTE LOSSES OR EXPENSES TO A THIRD PARTY AS A RESULT OF A THIRD PERSON
CLAIM AND (Y) ANY DAMAGES OF THE TYPES SET FORTH ABOVE IN CLAUSE (II) SHALL BE
RECOVERABLE TO THE EXTENT SUCH DAMAGES (A) WERE THE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE
RESULT OF THE EVENT, MATTER AND/OR BREACH THAT GAVE RISE THERETO OR (B) ARE
ASSUMED LIABILITIES OR EXCLUDED LIABILITIES.

 



 

(c) Seller Parent shall not be required to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)_ to the extent the matter in question was
specifically taken into account in the computation of the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 4.5_ or a Tax Refund Offset.

 



 

(d) Except for (i) equitable remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of
law, (ii) injunctive and provisional relief (including specific performance),
(iii) actual and intentional fraud by a party in connection with this
Agreement, if the Closing occurs and (iv) as provided in any Seller Ancillary
Agreement or Buyer Ancillary Agreement, _Section 8.2(a)_ and this _ARTICLE
XI_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims
for monetary relief relating to breaches of this Agreement (including any
covenant, obligation, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement) or otherwise in
respect of the sale of the Equity Interests or Purchased Assets contemplated
hereby. The parties may not avoid the limitations on liability, recovery and
recourse set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ and this _ARTICLE XI_ by seeking
damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory or
liability. Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of
Buyer or Seller Parent, after the consummation of the purchase and sale of the
Equity Interests or Purchased Assets contemplated by this Agreement, to
rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 11.7 _Mitigation_. Each of the parties agrees to take commercially
reasonable steps to the extent required by Law to mitigate their respective
Losses and Expenses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses and Expenses
that are indemnifiable hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence
shall not require any party hereto to initiate or pursue litigation or other
claims against third parties (other than taking the relevant administrative
steps to file for or make ordinary course claims under insurance policies) in
respect of such Loss.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.8 _Procedures for Certain Indemnity Claims_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
terms and conditions set forth on _Annex C_ hereto shall apply to, and to the
extent inconsistent with this _Article XI_, shall control with respect to,
all Subject Client Claims. " ** _Subject Client Claim_** " means any
individual claim (or series of related claims) for indemnification brought by
Buyer under this Agreement (i) to the extent resulting from or arising out of
a breach of Seller Parents representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 5.16_ with respect to a claim by a client of the Business whose
Client Contract is listed on _Section 5.15(iii)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter for a breach of such Client Contract and (ii) with respect to which the
Losses and Expenses claimed by Buyer exceed $200,000 but do not exceed
$2,000,000.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Subcontract Agreement or the Multiparty Shared Client Contract Relationship
Agreement, the terms and conditions set forth on _Annex D_ hereto shall apply
to, and to the extent inconsistent with this _Article XI_ or the provisions
of the Subcontract Agreement or Multiparty Shared Client Contract Relationship
Agreement, shall control with respect to, all Shared Client Claims. " **
_Shared Client Claim_** " means any individual claim (or series of related
claims) for indemnification brought by Buyer or Seller Parent under this
Agreement to the extent resulting from or arising out of a claim by any client
of the Business for a breach occurring after the Closing of such clients
Shared Client Contract (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Multiparty
Shared Client Contract) for which the other party has assumed or retained
liability pursuant to this Agreement as an Assumed Liability or Excluded
Liability, as applicable.

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller Parent;

 



 

(b) by Buyer if Seller Parent shall have breached any of its representations,

receipt of notice of such breach (or, if earlier, by the Termination Date);
_provided_ that Buyers right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

forth in _ARTICLE X_;

 



 

(c) by Seller Parent if Buyer shall have breached any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach

this _Section 12.1(c)_ shall not be available if Seller Parent is then in
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in _ARTICLE IX;_

 



 

(d) by Buyer or Seller Parent if any court or other Governmental Body having

_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 12.1(e)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of the
Agreement in the manner described in _Section 12.1(b)_ or _(c)_ has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or
prior to the Termination Date (for the avoidance of doubt, Buyers failure to
close due to the unavailability of the Debt Financing shall not in any way
limit its termination right pursuant to this _Section 12.1(e)_); or

 



 

(f) by Seller Parent, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE IX_
shall have been satisfied (other than any conditions that, by their nature,

obligations of _Section 7.7(e)_, _Section 8.9_ (Fees and Expenses), _Section
12.4_ (Reverse Termination Fee) and _ARTICLE XIII_ (Miscellaneous), which
provisions shall each survive such termination); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, except as provided in _Section 12.4_ and

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 13.16_, nothing in this _Section 12.3_ shall relieve any party

_Section 12.1(c)_ or _Section 12.1(f)_.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, if Buyer breaches this Agreement
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise, including
with respect to any allegation of fraud) or fails to perform hereunder
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise, including
with respect to any allegation of fraud), then, except for the right to seek
specific performance in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions of _Section 13.16_, the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller Parent
or any of its Affiliates or direct or indirect equity holders (whether at law,

current or future equityholders, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, general or limited partners, members, managers, Affiliates,
representatives, agents or assignees (each a " ** _Buyer Related Party_** ")
under any other agreement executed in connection with the transactions

payment of any Expenses incurred by Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates in
connection with the recovery or collection of the Reverse Termination Fee, up
to a maximum amount of $5,000,000 (" ** _Specified Expenses_** "); _provided_
, that in no event shall any Buyer Related Party in the aggregate be subject
to monetary damages other than the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee and
Specified Expenses. Except for the Buyers obligation to pay the Reverse
Termination Fee to the extent triggered and Specified Expenses, if any, (i) no
Buyer Related Party shall have any liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in
connection herewith (including the Financing Commitments, the Guarantees, any
Buyer Ancillary Agreement or Seller Ancillary Agreement) or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination
thereof), (ii) none of Seller Parent or its Affiliates shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any action, suit or proceeding against any Buyer Related
Party arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any contract or
agreement executed in connection herewith (including the Financing
Commitments, the Guarantees, any Buyer Ancillary Agreement or Seller Ancillary
Agreement) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination and

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Seller Parent shall cause any action, suit or proceeding pending in
connection with this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in
connection herewith (including the Financing Commitments or the Guarantees) or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or
termination thereof), to the extent maintained by Seller Parent or any of its
Affiliates against any Buyer Related Party, to be dismissed with prejudice
promptly, and in any event within five (5) business days after the payment of
the Reverse Termination Fee and Specified Expenses. Seller Parent shall not be
entitled to collect the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
Under no circumstance shall Seller Parent be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance and any portion of the Reverse
Termination Fee.

 



 

(c) Seller Parent, on behalf of each of the Selling Parties and its and their
respective Affiliates (including the Business Subsidiaries), acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this _Section 12.4_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. The parties
acknowledge and hereby agree that the Reverse Termination Fee and Specified
Expenses, if, as and when required pursuant to this _Section 12.4_, shall not
constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount
that will compensate the party receiving such amount in the circumstances in
which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Buyer Ancillary Agreements and the Seller Ancillary
Agreements, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

_Section 13.4_ , _Section 13.7_ , this _Section 13.9_ or _Section 13.18(b)_
(or any amendment or waiver of any other provision of this Agreement that

relates shall be required before such amendment or waiver is rendered
effective.

 



 

Section 13.10 _Interpretation_. Articles, titles and headings to sections
herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to
be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The
annexes, schedules and exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with and
as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set
forth verbatim herein. Any disclosure with respect to a Section of this
Agreement included in any Section of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed to be disclosed for other Sections of this Agreement to the extent that
such disclosure is reasonably sufficient so that the relevance of such
disclosure would be reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure to a
reader of such disclosure. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion
of any specific item in any schedule hereto or in the Seller Disclosure Letter
is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use
the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such
item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in any schedule or
the Seller Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically provides otherwise, neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any
schedule hereto or in the Seller Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that
such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary
course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or
the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in any schedule hereto or in the Seller Disclosure Letter is or is
not in the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 13.11 _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or
parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any
party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such
party. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of
this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in
any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the
right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No
waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach.

 



 

Section 13.12 _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Requirements of Law, but in case any one or more of the provisions
contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof,
unless such a construction would be unreasonable.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 13.13 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original
instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto.

 



 

Section 13.14 _Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein and subject to any
difference of standards set forth in this Agreement with respect to any
particular matter (including under _Section 7.3_ ), each of the parties hereto
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
action, to do or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Requirements of Law to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the obligations
of any of the parties hereto; (ii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the performance of the obligations hereunder; and (iii) the
execution and delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other
actions, as the other party hereto may reasonably require in order to carry
out the intent of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from time to time
following the Closing, Seller Parent shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, to Buyer such other instruments of conveyance and
transfer as Buyer may reasonably request or as may be otherwise necessary to
more effectively convey and transfer to, and vest in, Buyer and put Buyer in
possession of, any part of the Equity Interests and Purchased Assets;
_provided_ , _however_ , that _Section 2.2_ shall govern with respect to
approvals, consents and waivers required in connection with the transfer of
Contracts and Governmental Permits. From time to time following the Closing,
Buyer shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to
Seller Parent such other instruments of assumption as Seller Parent may
reasonably request or as may be otherwise necessary to evidence the assumption
by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

(c) Seller Parent and Buyer acknowledge and agree that (i) certain assets of
the Sellers or their Affiliates defined as "Purchased Assets" hereunder may
inadvertently not have been transferred pursuant to this Agreement or may have
been transferred to Seller Parent or its Affiliates from a Business Subsidiary
and (ii) certain assets of the Seller Parties or their Affiliates defined as
"Excluded Assets" hereunder may inadvertently have been transferred pursuant
to this Agreement or certain assets that should have been transferred to
Seller Parent or its Affiliates (other than the Business Subsidiaries)
pursuant to the plan of reorganization as detailed in _Schedule 7.6_ may have
been transferred to or retained by a Business Subsidiary. If, following the
Closing, the Buyer or Seller Parent reasonably determines that any Excluded
Asset or such other asset that should have been transferred to Seller Parent
or its Affiliates (other than the Business Subsidiaries) was transferred to
the Buyer, the parties agree to cooperate to transfer back such asset to
Seller Parent or its designated Affiliate as promptly as practicable without
the payment of consideration. If, following the Closing, Seller Parent or the
Buyer determines that

 



      
 

 



 

any Purchased Asset was not transferred to the Buyer or was transferred from a
Business Subsidiary, the parties agree to cooperate to transfer such Purchased
Asset to the Buyer (or its designated Affiliate) as promptly as practicable
without the payment of any further consideration. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing in this _Section 13.14(c)_ , if after the Closing,
Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller Parent, on the other hand, become aware of
any Intellectual Property that qualifies as Transferred Intellectual Property
but was not included in the Purchased Assets assigned to Buyer at Closing,
then, subject to _Section 2.2_ , Seller Parent shall execute and deliver (and
shall cause its Affiliates to execute and deliver) all instruments and
documents reasonably necessary in connection with (i) in the case of
Intellectual Property owned by Seller Parent or its Affiliates, transferring
all right, title, and interest of such Intellectual Property to Buyer or its
designee, or (ii) in the case of Intellectual Property owned by a third
Person, effecting an assignment to Buyer of the applicable Contract, or
granting to Buyer or its designee a license, sublicense, or other right to use
such Intellectual Property, in each case retroactively beginning at the
Closing.

Agreements or any certificates delivered pursuant hereto and thereto, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that none of Seller Parent, the Business Subsidiaries,
the Selling Parties or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,

materials prepared by or on behalf of Seller Parent, the Business Subsidiaries
or Selling Parties or in any other form or (ii) any information delivered or
made available pursuant to _Section 6.1_.

information provided or made available, or statements made (including set
forth in management summaries relating to the Business provided to Buyer, in
materials made available in any "data room" (virtual or otherwise), in
presentations by Seller Parent or the Businesss management or otherwise), to
Buyer or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons,
advisors, agents or representatives (or any omissions therefrom).

 



 

(d) In connection with Buyers investigation of the Business Subsidiaries, the
Business and the Purchased Assets, Buyer has received or may receive certain
projections, including projected statements of future operating revenues and
income from future operations of the Business and certain forward looking
business plan information. Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts
and forward looking plans, that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties and
that Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and
forward looking plans so furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts. Accordingly,
Buyer hereby acknowledges that none of Seller Parent, the Business
Subsidiaries, Selling Parties or any other Person are making any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and forward looking plans, including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts, and

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer hereby disclaims any reliance on such estimates, projections and other
forecasts and forward looking plans and agrees that it has not relied thereon.

 



 

Section 13.16 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, subject to _Section 13.16(b)_ , but notwithstanding
any other provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties
shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which any party may be
entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction or injunctions or other relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof in any court described in _Section 13.3_ , in each case
without the requirement of posting a bond or proving actual damages (which
requirements the other parties hereby waive). If on the Termination Date,
there is a pending action that has been brought by a party hereto before a
court of competent jurisdiction seeking the remedies provided for in this
_Section 13.16_ , then, without further action, the Termination Date shall be
automatically extended until the date that is five business days after the
dismissal, settlement or entry of a final and non-appealable order with
respect to such action.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereby acknowledge and agree that Seller Parent shall be entitled to specific
performance to cause Buyer to draw down the proceeds of the Equity Financing
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letters and to
consummate the Closing in accordance with _ARTICLE II_ , in each case, if and
only if (i) all conditions in _ARTICLE IX_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived, (ii) the Debt Financing (or alternative financing in
accordance with _Section 7.7(b)_ ) has been funded or will be funded on the
Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter (or
New Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable) if the Equity Financing is funded,
(iii) the Seller Parent has irrevocably confirmed in writing that, if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded,
then the Closing will occur in accordance with _ARTICLE IV_ and (iv) Buyer
fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have
occurred pursuant to _Section 4.1_.

 



 

Section 13.17 _Legal Representation_.

 



 

(a) In any dispute or proceeding arising after the Closing under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby, the
parties agree that Seller Parent shall have the right, at its election, to
retain the firm of Sidley Austin LLP (" ** _Sidley_** ") to represent it and
its Affiliates in such matter, and Buyer (on behalf of themselves, their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and representatives and
their respective successors and assigns) hereby agrees, and agrees to cause
the Business Subsidiaries to agree, to irrevocably waive and consent to any
such representation in any such matter. Buyer further consents and agrees to,
and agrees to cause the Business Subsidiaries to consent and agree to, the
communication by Sidley to Seller Parent in connection with any such
representation of any fact known to Sidley arising by reason of Sidleys
representation of the Business Subsidiaries.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each of the parties further agrees that, as to all communications between
Sidley, on the one hand, and Seller Parent and/or the Business Subsidiaries,
on the other hand, in the course of the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
agreement contemplated hereby, the attorney-client privilege, attorney work
product protection, the expectation of client confidence and all other rights
to any evidentiary privilege or protection (" ** _Privileged Information_** ")
belong to Seller Parent and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Business
Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates following the Closing.

 



 

(c) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby are consummated: (i) the Business Subsidiaries
shall have no right of access to or control over any of Sidleys records
related to the Privileged Information, which shall become the property of (and
be controlled by) Seller Parent; and (ii) because it would be impracticable to
remove from the records (including emails and other electronic files) of the
Business Subsidiaries or included in the Purchased Assets any Privileged
Information, the parties agree that no attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product or other applicable evidentiary privilege or protection is waived
or intended to be waived by allowing such material to remain in the files of
the Business Subsidiaries or in the Purchased Assets.

 



 

(d) Furthermore, in the event of a dispute between Seller Parent, on the one
hand, and the Business Subsidiaries, on the other hand, arising out of or
relating to any matter in connection with the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
agreement contemplated hereby, none of the attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product protection, the expectation of client confidence or any other
rights to any evidentiary privilege or protection will protect from disclosure
to Seller Parent any information or documents which constitute Privileged
Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
between Buyer and the Business Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third
Person (other than Seller Parent), on the other hand, Buyer and the Business
Subsidiaries may assert any applicable privilege or protection to prevent the
disclosure of Privileged Information to such third Person; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Buyer nor the Business Subsidiaries may waive such
privilege or protection without the prior written consent of Seller Parent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Buyer agrees not to disclose, and to cause each of its subsidiaries not to
disclose, any Privileged Information that it may possess to any Person
following the Closing, unless compelled to disclose by a Requirement of Law.
In the event that Buyer or any of the Business Subsidiaries is legally
required by governmental order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all
or a portion of such Privileged Information, Buyer shall promptly notify
Seller Parent in writing (including by making specific reference to this
Section) so that Seller Parent can seek a protective order and Buyer agrees to
use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist therewith. To the extent
that files or other materials relating to Privileged Information maintained by
Sidley constitute property of its clients, only Seller Parent shall hold such
property rights and Sidley shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any such
files or other materials or any Privileged Information by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Sidley, on the one hand, and Seller
Parent and the Business Subsidiaries, on the other hand. Unless legally
required by government order or otherwise, or except as necessary in
connection with a claim by a third Person (in each case

 



      
 

 



 

subject to Buyers obligations as set forth herein), Buyer agrees that it will
not, and that it will cause the Business Subsidiaries not to, seek to obtain
such Privileged Information from Sidley.

 



 

Section 13.18 _Non-Recourse_.

 



 

(a) No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, agent, attorney or representative of a party or its
Affiliates, or any stockholder of a party, shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of such party under this Agreement, the Seller
Ancillary Agreements or the Buyer Ancillary Agreements of or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby.

 



 

(b) Subject to the rights of Buyer under the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, in each case under the terms thereof,
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller Parent agrees on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates that the Lender Related Parties shall not
have any liability or obligation to Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates
(whether under contract or tort, in equity or otherwise) relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein (including the Debt
Financing).

 **Alternative Dispute Resolution Process for Subject Client Claims**

 



 

Section 13.1 _Notice_. Buyer shall promptly give notice to Seller Parent of
any Subject Client Claim, describing in reasonable detail the facts giving
rise to such claim (including identifying the applicable Client Contract and
the provision thereof that the Client has alleged has been breached) and
including in such notice (in each case to the extent then known) the amount or
the method of computation of the amount of such claim. The failure to give
notice as provided in this paragraph 1 shall not relieve Seller Parent of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have been materially
prejudiced by such failure. Any such notice shall be delivered to the two
individuals designated by Seller Parent for the purpose of resolving such
claims (the " _Seller Designees_ "), who shall initially be: [Name] ([email
address] / [address]) and [Name] ([email address] / [address]).

 



 

Section 13.2 _Consultation by Seller and Buyer Designees_.

 



 

(a) The Seller Designees and two individuals designated by Buyer for the
purpose of resolving Subject Client Claims (the " _Buyer Designees_ ") (who
shall initially be: [Name] ([email address] / [address]) and [Name] ([email
address] / [address])) shall consult with each other in developing a response
and proposed settlement for any Subject Client Claim, including the manner and
amount of settlement of such claim with the applicable Client.

 



 

(b) Following such consultation, and in any event within ten business days of
delivery of the notice by Buyer pursuant to paragraph 1 above, Buyer shall
submit to Seller Parent the proposed settlement amount payable to the
applicable Client for such Subject Client Claim, and Seller Parent shall have
five business days to consent to such proposed settlement amount, consent to a
portion of such proposed settlement amount or reject such proposed settlement
amount. If Seller Parent so consents, such proposed settlement amount (or such
portion thereof consented to by Seller Parent) shall be indemnifiable by
Seller Parent under _Article XI_ of this Agreement, subject to any applicable
limitations set forth herein and therein (e.g., the per claim (or series of
related claims) _de minimis_ threshold and deductible). If Seller Parent does
not so consent, or consents to only a portion of such settlement amount, such
settlement amount or the difference between the consented to settlement amount
and the actual amount of the settlement payment (a " _Disputed Amount_ ")
shall be subject to the escalation procedures described below in paragraphs 3
and 4 below.

 



 

Section 13.3 _Referral to Designated Executives_.

 



 

(a) If (i) any claims with respect to which Disputed Amounts arise after
completion of the consultation process provided for in paragraph 2 above and
such claims remain outstanding as of the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the
Closing Date ( _i.e._ , the date after which no further Subject Client Claims
may be made) (the " _Escalation Date_ "), and (ii) the Disputed Amount(s) with
respect to such claims, together with all other Losses and Expenses (other
than Losses and Expenses excluded by clause (w) of the first

 



 

Annex C - 1     
 

 



 

proviso of _Section 11.1(a)_ of this Agreement) suffered by Buyer or any other
Buyer Indemnified Party (including the Business Subsidiaries) pursuant to
_Section 11.1(a)(i)_ of this Agreement, in the aggregate exceed $43,000,000,
then Buyer shall have the option, but not the obligation, to, within five (5)
business days after the Escalation Date, submit such claims for resolution
pursuant to this paragraph 3 by the [name/title of executive of Seller Parent]
and [name/title of executive of Tempo/Buyer] (together, the " _Designated
Executives_ "). Notice of any claims submitted to the Designated Executives
must be sent in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in _Section
13.6_ of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Designated Executives, together with the Seller Designees and the
Buyer Designees, shall be required to meet (in person or by phone) to discuss
the applicable claim(s) underlying such Disputed Amount(s) and work together
to determine the Indemnifiable Amount, if any, with respect to each such
claim. If the Designated Executives agree in writing as to the Indemnifiable
Amount with respect to any such claim, such claim shall be indemnifiable by
Seller Parent under _Article XI_ of this Agreement up to a maximum amount
equal to the Indemnifiable Amount, subject to the applicable limitations set
forth herein and therein (e.g., the per claim (or series of related claims)
_de minimis_ threshold and deductible). If the Designated Executives agree
that the Buyer Indemnified Parties (including the Business Subsidiaries) have
no legal liability to the applicable Client under the applicable Client
Contract with respect to the applicable Subject Client Claim, then Seller
Parent shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer with respect to any portion
of such Disputed Amount or such Subject Client Claim.

 



 

(c) " _Indemnifiable Amount_ " means the amount of all Losses and Expenses of
the applicable party to the applicable Client Contract resulting from or
arising out of the applicable Subject Client Claim (provided that such amount
shall in no event be deemed to be greater than the amount of any settlement
with respect thereto paid to the applicable Client and agreed to by such
Client), plus any other Losses and Expenses incurred by Buyer in connection
with such claim.

 



 

Section 13.4 _Arbitration_.

 



 

(a) In the event that the Designated Executives are unable to reach an
agreement to resolve all then-outstanding claims for which there is a Disputed
Amount within 10 days (or such longer period mutually agreed by the Designated
Executives) after submission of such Disputed Amounts to the Designated
Executives, either party may submit any or all such unresolved Disputed
Amounts to arbitration for full and final resolution in accordance with this
paragraph 4. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Agreement to the
contrary, the arbitration set forth herein shall be the sole and exclusive
mechanism for dispute resolution in regard to any such Disputed Amount. Any
such arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with JAMS Comprehensive
Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect (the " _JAMS Rules_ "), except
as they may be modified herein or by mutual written agreement of the parties.

 



 

(b) The parties stipulate that they will select one neutral arbitrator who is
a retired judge with experience in commercial litigation. If the parties are
unable to reach agreement on the identity of the arbitrator within 10 days
after the initiation of the

 



 

Annex C - 2     
 

 



 

arbitration, then the appointment of the arbitrator shall be made in
accordance with the process set forth in the JAMS Rules, provided that all
arbitrator candidates in such process shall satisfy the criteria set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence. The seat of the arbitration shall be
Chicago, Illinois.

 



 

(c) The arbitrator will be instructed to determine the Indemnifiable Amount,
if any, with respect to each claim underlying the Disputed Amounts submitted
for resolution through arbitration. If the arbitrator determines an
Indemnifiable Amount with respect to any such claim, such claim shall be
indemnifiable by Seller Parent under _Article XI_ of this Agreement up to a
maximum amount equal to the Indemnifiable Amount, subject to the applicable
limitations set forth herein and therein (e.g., the per claim (or series of
related claims) _de minimis_ threshold and deductible). If the arbitrator
determines that Buyer and/or the Buyer Indemnified Party(ies) (including the
Business Subsidiaries) have no legal liability to the applicable Client under

 _Notice_. The Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice to the Indemnitor
of any Shared Client Claim, describing in reasonable detail the facts giving
rise to such claim (including identifying the applicable Client Contract and
the provision thereof that the Client has alleged has been breached) and
including in such notice (in each case to the extent then known) the amount or
the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the
provision of this Agreement, the Subcontract Agreement or the Multiparty
Shared Client Contract Relationship Agreement upon which claim is based. The
failure to give notice as provided in this paragraph 1 shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have
been materially prejudiced by such failure. Any such notice shall be delivered
to the two individuals designated by Seller Parent for the purpose of
resolving such claims (the " _Seller Designees_ "), who shall initially be:
[Name] ([email address] / [address]) and [Name] ([email address] / [address]).
The two individuals designated by Buyer (the " _Buyer Designees_ ") shall
initially be: [Name] ([email address] / [address]) and [Name] ([email address]
/ [address]).

 



 

Section 13.5 _Consultation by Seller and Buyer Designees_.

 



 

(a) The Seller Designees and Buyer Designees shall consult with each other in
developing a response and proposed settlement for any Shared Client Claim
(including the manner and amount of settlement).

 



 

(b) Following such consultation, and in any event within ten business days of
delivery of the notice by the Indemnified Party pursuant to paragraph 1 above,
the Indemnified Party shall submit to the Indemnitor the proposed settlement
amount payable to the applicable Client for such Shared Client Claim, and the
Indemnitor shall have five business days to consent to such proposed
settlement amount, consent to a portion of such proposed settlement amount or
reject such proposed settlement amount. If the Indemnitor so consents, such
proposed settlement amount (or such portion thereof consented to by the
Indemnitor) shall be indemnifiable by the Indemnitor under _Article XI_ of
this Agreement, subject to the applicable limitations, if any, set forth in
(i) _Article XI_ of this Agreement, (ii) the Subcontract Agreement, (iii) the
Multiparty Shared Client Contract Relationship Agreement and (iv) this _Annex
D_. If the Indemnitor does not so consent, or consents to only a portion of
such settlement amount, such settlement amount or the difference between the
consented to settlement amount and the actual amount of the settlement payment
(a " _Disputed Amount_ ") shall be subject to the escalation procedures
described below in paragraphs 4 and 5 below.

 



 

Section 13.6 _Referral to Designated Executives_.

 



 

(a) If any claims with respect to which Disputed Amounts arise after
completion of the consultation process provided for in paragraph 2 above and
such remain outstanding as of the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing
Date or any subsequent twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date (each
such date, an

 



 

Annex D - 1     
 

 



 

" _Escalation Date_ "), then the Indemnified Party shall have the option, but
not the obligation, to, within five (5) business days after the Escalation
Date, submit such claims for resolution pursuant to this paragraph 4 by the
[name/title of executive of Seller Parent] and [name/title of executive of
Tempo/Buyer] (together, the " _Designated Executives_ "); _provided_ , that,
with respect to any Disputed Amount related to a Shared Client Claim that
exceeds $2,000,000, such Disputed Amount may be submitted to the Designated
Executives immediately after completion of the consultation process provided
for in paragraph 3 above. Notice of any claims submitted to the Designated
Executives must be sent in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in
_Section 13.6_ of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Designated Executives, together with the Seller Designees and the
Buyer Designees, shall be required to meet (in person or by phone) to discuss
the applicable claim(s) underlying such Disputed Amount(s) and work together
to determine the Indemnifiable Amount, if any, with respect to each such
claim. If the Designated Executives agree in writing as to the Indemnifiable
Amount with respect to any such claim, such claim shall be indemnifiable by
Seller Parent under _Article XI_ of this Agreement or, if applicable, under
the applicable provision of a Subcontract Agreement, up to a maximum amount
equal to the Indemnifiable Amount, subject to the applicable limitations, if
any, set forth in (i) _Article XI_ of this Agreement, (ii) the Subcontract
Agreement, (iii) the Multiparty Shared Client Contract Relationship Agreement
and (iv) this _Annex D_. If the Designated Executives agree that the
applicable party to the applicable Shared Client Contract (i.e., Seller Parent
or one of its Affiliates or Buyer or another Buyer Indemnified Party) has no
legal liability to the applicable Client under such Shared Client Contract
with respect to the applicable claim, then the Indemnitor shall have no
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to any portion of
such Disputed Amount or the underlying claim.

 



 

(c) " _Indemnifiable Amount_ " means the amount of all Losses and Expenses of
the applicable party to the applicable Shared Client Contract (i.e., Seller
Parent or one of its Affiliates, or Buyer or another Buyer Indemnified Party)
resulting from or arising out of the applicable Shared Client Claim (provided
that such amount shall in no event be deemed to be greater than the amount of
any settlement with respect thereto paid to the applicable Client and agreed
to by such Client), plus any other Losses and Expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with such claim.

Section 13.7 _Arbitration_.

 



 

(a) In the event that the Designated Executives are unable to reach an
agreement to resolve all then-outstanding claims for which there is a Disputed
Amount within 10 days (or such longer period mutually agreed by the Designated
Executives) after submission of such Disputed Amounts to the Designated
Executives, either party may submit any or all such unresolved Disputed
Amounts to arbitration for full and final resolution in accordance with this
paragraph 5. Any such arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with JAMS
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect (the " _JAMS
Rules_ "), except as they may be modified herein or by mutual written
agreement of the parties.

 



 

(b) The parties stipulate that they will select one neutral arbitrator who is
a retired judge with experience in commercial litigation. If the parties are
unable to reach agreement on the identity of the arbitrator within 10 days
after the initiation of the arbitration, then the appointment of the
arbitrator shall be made in accordance with the process set forth in the JAMS
Rules, provided that all arbitrator candidates in such process shall satisfy
the criteria set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. The seat of the
arbitration shall be Chicago, Illinois.

 



 

(c) The arbitrator will be instructed to determine the Indemnifiable Amount,
if any, with respect to each claim underlying the Disputed Amounts submitted
for resolution through arbitration. If the arbitrator determines an
Indemnifiable Amount with respect to any such claim, such claim shall be
indemnifiable by Seller Parent under _Article XI_ of this Agreement or, if
applicable, under the applicable provision of a Subcontract Agreement, up to a
maximum amount equal to the Indemnifiable Amount, subject to the applicable
limitations, if any, set forth in (i) _Article XI_ of this Agreement, (ii) the
Subcontract Agreement, (iii) the Multiparty Shared Client Contract
Relationship Agreement and (iv) this _Annex D_. If the arbitrator determines
that the applicable party to the applicable Shared Client Contract has no
legal liability to the applicable Client under such Shared Client Contract
with respect to such claim, then the Indemnitor shall have no obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to any portion of such Disputed
Amount or the underlying claim.

 



 

(d) If a claim submitted for resolution through arbitration is settled by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliate with the applicable Client before or during
the arbitration without the Indemnitors prior written consent, the
Indemnified Party shall not offer into evidence in the arbitration such
settlement amount, but the Indemnified Party shall provide notice to the
Indemnitor of such settlement and, at the Indemnitors option, the Indemnitor
may offer into evidence the amount of such settlement.

 



 

(e) In no event will the amount the Indemnitor is required to indemnify the
Indemnified for any Shared Client Claim exceed the Indemnifiable Amount with
respect to such claim.

 



 

Annex D - 3     
 

 



 

(f) The Indemnified Party shall not offer into evidence in the arbitration any
evidence not previously presented to the Indemnitor during the consultation
and escalation process described in paragraphs 1-4 above.

 



 

(g) The arbitrator shall be instructed to hold one hearing regarding the
dispute within 30 days of his or her selection and to render a decision in
writing no later than 60 days after the conclusion of such hearing, in each
case unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties. The final
decision of the arbitrator: (i) shall include the amount of the award to the
Indemnified Party to be paid by the Indemnitor with respect to the dispute, if
any (applying the applicable limitations set forth in (A) _Article XI_ of this
Agreement, (B) the Subcontract Agreement, (C) the Multiparty Shared Client
Contract Relationship Agreement and (D) this _Annex D_ ); (ii) shall be
furnished to the parties as a written opinion, render findings of fact and
conclusions of law and set forth the basis and reasons for any decision
reached; and (iii) shall constitute a conclusive determination of the dispute,
be binding upon the parties and not be contested by either party (whether by
judicial review of the award, collateral attack or otherwise).

 



 

(h) The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be paid by the party whose
position with respect to the matter in dispute is the further from the final
determination.

 



 

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(vi)_ of the
Agreement, all liabilities and obligations of Seller Parent and its Affiliates
under or in respect of the Shared Contracts and the Multiparty Shared Client
Contracts to the extent relating to or arising out of the Retained Business or
the actions or omissions by Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates after the
Closing constitute Excluded Liabilities and, therefore, are not subject to the
per claim (or series of related claims) _de minimis_ threshold, deductible or
cap).

 



 

(j) For the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)(i)_ of the
Agreement, all liabilities and obligations of the Selling Parties under or in
respect of the Shared Contracts and Multiparty Shared Client Contracts, in
each case to the extent relating to or arising out of the Business or the
actions or omissions by Buyer or any of its Affiliates constitute Assumed
Liabilities and, therefore, are not subject to the per claim (or series of
related claims) _de minimis_ threshold, deductible or cap).
