before or after the Mergers, if such fact, circumstance or action would be reasonably expected to cause the Mergers, taken together,
to fail to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. The Mergers, taken together, shall be reported by the Parties for all Tax purposes
in accordance with the Intended Tax Treatment, including the filing of the statement required by Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-3, unless otherwise required by a Governmental Entity as a result of a &ldquo;determination&rdquo; within the meaning of

support the Intended Tax Treatment, including providing factual support letters of the sort customarily provided as the basis
for a legal opinion that the Mergers qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. For the avoidance of doubt, the qualification of
the Mergers for the Intended Tax Treatment will not be a condition to Closing.</P>

the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction and immediate injunctive
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and
without bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Each of the Parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that it may be difficult to prove damages with reasonable certainty,
that it may be difficult to procure suitable substitute performance, and that injunctive relief and/or specific performance will
not cause an undue hardship to the Parties. Each of the Parties hereby further acknowledges that the existence of any other remedy
contemplated by this Agreement does not diminish the availability of specific performance of the obligations hereunder or any
other injunctive relief. Each Party hereby further agrees that in the event of any action by any other party for specific performance
or injunctive relief, it will not assert that a remedy at law or other remedy would be adequate or that specific performance or
injunctive relief in respect of such breach or violation should not be available on the grounds that money damages are adequate
