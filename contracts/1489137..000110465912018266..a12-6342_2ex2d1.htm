been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in

to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or could not reasonably be
expected to prevent or significantly impede or materially delay the completion
of the Arrangement.

 



 

(d) _No Violation_. Subject to obtaining the authorizations, consents and
approvals and making the filings referred to in Section 3.1(c) and complying
with applicable Laws, the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the
completion of the Arrangement do not and will not (nor will they with the

Company Annual Financial Statements, in the auditors report thereon and (ii)
except that the Company Interim Financial Statements are subject to normal
period-end adjustments and may omit notes which are not required by applicable
Canadian Securities Laws or Canadian GAAP. The Company Financial Statements,
together with the related managements discussion and analysis, present
fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) and financial condition of the Company and
the Company Entities on a consolidated basis as at the respective dates
thereof and the revenues, earnings, results of operations, changes in
shareholders equity and cash flows of the Company and the Company Entities on

reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with Canadian GAAP and has otherwise complied with NI 52-109. To
the knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, (i) there are
no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design and
implementation or maintenance of the Internal Controls that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the ability of the Company **** to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) there is no fraud, whether

of the Company or any of the Company Entities has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether

(other than those disclosed in the Company Interim Financial Statements), a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (iii) liabilities and obligations
incurred as expressly permitted or specifically contemplated by this Agreement

except as disclosed in Section 3.1(u)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
there exists no state of facts which after notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a default under or breach or violation of any Material
Contract or the inability of a party to any Material Contract to perform its
obligations thereunder where, in any such case, such default, breach,
violation or non-performance has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

calculation of the entitlements of each such person.

 



 

(w) _Health and Safety_. All material inspection reports under all applicable
health and safety Laws and similar Laws pertaining to the employees and the

the Company.

 



 

(y) _Acceleration of Benefits_. Except as contemplated herein, in Section

(iii) Except as set out in Section 3.1(z)(iii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter:

 



 

A. all of the Company Plans and Canadian Plans are and have been established,
registered, qualified and, in all material respects, administered in
accordance with (1) all applicable Laws, (2) the respective terms of such
Company Plans and Canadian Plans and (3) the terms of any agreements between
the Company or any of the Company Entities, as the case may be, and their
respective employees and former employees who are participants in the Company
Plans and Canadian Plans. There have been no prohibited transactions or
breaches of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of
Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the Company Plans that could
result in any material liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code being
imposed on the Company or any Company Entity. Each Company Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has been
determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be so qualified, and each trust
created thereunder has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be
exempt from tax under the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to
the knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of any such
determination that could reasonably be expected to give the Internal Revenue
Service grounds to revoke such determination,

 



 

B. all contributions or premiums required to be made by the Company or any of
the Company Entities, as the case may be, under the terms of each Company Plan
or Canadian Plan or by applicable Laws have been made in a timely fashion in
accordance with applicable Laws and the terms of the Company Plans and
Canadian Plans,

 



 

C. each Company Plan and Canadian Plan is insured or funded as may be required
by applicable Law and in good standing with such Governmental Authorities as
may be applicable and, as of the date hereof, no currently outstanding notice
of under-funding, non-compliance, failure to be in good standing or otherwise
has been received by the Company or any of the Company Entities from any such
Governmental Authorities. No Company Plan or Canadian Plan provides any non-
pension post-retirement or post-employment benefits (except to the extent
required by Section 4980B of the Code). To the knowledge of the Company, no
Company Plan or Canadian Plan provides benefits to any individual who is not a
current or former employee of the Company or a Company Entity, or the
dependents or beneficiaries of any such current or former employee. With
respect to each group health plan benefiting any current or former employee of
the Company or any member of the Controlled Group that is subject to

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4980B of the Code, the Company and each member of the Controlled Group
has complied in all material respects with the continuation coverage
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I
of ERISA,

 



 

D. no Company Plan or Canadian Plan is subject to any pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened investigation, examination, action, claim
or other Proceeding initiated by any Governmental Authority or any other
party, other than routine claims for benefits,

 



 

E. neither the Company nor any member of the Controlled Group sponsors,
maintains or has any material liability (whether actual or contingent, with
respect to any of its assets or otherwise) with respect to any current or
former "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA, a pension
plan subject to the funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code, a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or
Section 414(f) of the Code or a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of
Section 210(a) of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code. Neither the Company nor
any member of the Controlled Group has any liability under Title IV of ERISA
(other than for premiums pursuant to Section 4007 of ERISA which have been
timely paid) or Section 4971 of the Code, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no condition exists that presents a risk to the Company or any member
of the Controlled Group of incurring any such liability. Each Company Plan to
which Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA applies has satisfied
the requirements of Sections 412, 430 and 436 of the Code and Sections 302 and
303 of ERISA, and no such Company Plan has a "funding shortfall" within the
meaning of Section 430(c) of the Code or Section 303(c) of ERISA or is in "at-
risk status" within the meaning of Section 430(i)(4) of the Code or Section
303(i)(4) of ERISA or subject to the limitations of Section 436 of the Code.
No Company Plan has an accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, has any waiver of the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of
ERISA and Section 412 of the Code been requested of or granted by the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to any Company Plan, nor has any Lien in favour
of any Company Plan arisen under Section 412(n) or 430(k) of the Code or
Section 302(f) or 303(k) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any member of the
Controlled Group has been required to provide security to any defined benefit
pension plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or Section 306 or 307
of ERISA. With respect to each Company Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, the fair market value
of the assets of such

 



      
 

 



 

Company Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of all accrued
benefits under such Company Plan (whether or not vested), based upon the
actuarial assumptions used to prepare the most recent actuarial report for
such Company Plan and no event has occurred which would be reasonably expected
to change any such funded status. Since the date which is five years prior to
the date of this Agreement, there has been no "reportable event" within the
meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations and interpretations
thereunder which has not been fully and accurately reported in a timely
fashion, as required, or which, whether or not reported, would constitute
grounds for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to institute termination
proceedings with respect to any Company Plan,

 



 

F. neither the Company nor any of its affiliates with U.S. employees has
prepaid or prefunded any welfare plan (as defined in the ERISA) through a
trust, reserve, premium stabilization or similar account, nor does it provide
benefits through a voluntary employee beneficiary association as defined in
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code,

 



 

G. except for Company Plans for which all material information relating
thereto is contained in the Company Data Room, neither the Company nor any of
its affiliates is a party to any contract, agreement or arrangement that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code.
Each such nonqualified deferred compensation plan has been operated since
January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the
guidance and regulations issued thereunder. No nonqualified deferred
compensation plan that is intended to be grandfathered has been "materially
modified" (within the meaning of United States Internal Revenue Service Notice
2005-1) at any time after October 3, 2004. No stock option or other right to
acquire Company or affiliate common stock or other equity of the Company or
any of its affiliates (A) has an exercise price that has been or may be less
than the fair market value of the underlying equity as of the date such option
or right was granted, as determined by the Board of Directors or a committee
thereof or the board of directors or a committee thereof of such affiliate, as
applicable, in good faith, (B) has any feature for the deferral of
compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income until the later
of exercise or disposition of such option or right or (C) has been granted
after December 31, 2004 with respect to any class of stock or equity of the
Company or any of its affiliates that is not "service recipient stock" (within
the meaning of applicable regulations under Section 409A of the Internal
Revenue Section 409A),

 



      
 

 



 

H. neither the Company nor any Company Entity has ever sponsored or
maintained, had any obligation to sponsor or maintain, or had any liability
(whether actual or contingent, with respect to any of its assets or otherwise)
with respect to any "registered pension plan" (as defined in subsection 248(1)
of the Tax Act) with a "defined benefit provision" (as defined in subsection
147.1(1) of the Tax Act),

 



 

I. except as expressly acknowledged under Section 5.8(b) of this Agreement or
as otherwise set forth or disclosed in this Agreement or the Company
Disclosure Letter, neither the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement, nor the consummation of any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, will result in any bonus, golden parachute, severance or
other payment or obligation to any current or former employee or director of
the Company or any Company Entity with respect to employment or service in
Canada (whether or not under any Company Plan or any Canadian Plan),
materially increase the benefits payable or provided under any Canadian Plan,
result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefit, or increase or accelerate employer contributions thereunder,

 



 

J. none of the Canadian Plans require or permit any material retroactive
increase in premiums or payments, and the level of insurance reserves, if any,
under any self-insured Canadian Plan is reasonable and sufficient to provide
for all unreported claims and incurred losses,

 



 

K. neither the Company nor any Company Entity has any liability (whether
actual or contingent, with respect to any of its assets or otherwise) with
respect to any "multi-employer plan" (as defined in subsection 147.1(1) of the
Tax Act), and, in particular and for greater certainty, neither the Company
nor any Company Entity has any liability (whether actual or contingent, with
respect to any of its assets or otherwise) with respect to any "multi-employer
pension plan" (as defined in section 11 of the Supplemental Pension Plans Act
(Quebec) and subsection 1(1) of the Pension Benefits Act (New Brunswick)), and

 



 

L. no former or current director, officer or employee of the Company or any of
the Company Entities owns, has or is entitled to any royalty, net profits
interest, carried interest or other encumbrance of any kind or nature
whatsoever which is based on revenues from any of the properties or assets of
the Company or any Company Entity or any revenue or rights attributed thereto,
or has any cause of action or other claim whatsoever against, or owes any
amount to, the Company or any Company Entity, except for any claims in

 



       
 

 



 

the ordinary course of business, such as for accrued vacation pay, accrued
employee benefits or reimbursement of expenses.

Except as specifically disclosed in the correspondingly numbered subsection of

recognized) in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business as

hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of the
Parent and the Purchaser and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Parent and the Purchaser enforceable against each of them in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
fraudulent transfer, moratorium and other Laws relating to or affecting the

generally and general principles of equity and public policy and to the
qualification that equitable remedies such as specific performance and
injunction may be granted only in the discretion of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

 



 

(c) _Required Approvals_. No authorization, licence, Permit, certificate,
registration, consent or approval of, or filing with, or notification to, any

Arrangement, other than:

 



 

(i) the Interim Order and any filings required in order to obtain, and
approvals required under, the Interim Order;

 



 

(ii) the Final Order, and any filings required in order to obtain the Final

or significantly impede or materially delay the completion of the Arrangement.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _No Violation_. Subject to obtaining the authorizations, consents and
approvals and making the filings referred to in Section 3.2(c) and complying

result in a contravention, breach, violation or default under any Law
applicable to it, (ii) result in a contravention, conflict, violation, breach
or default under its constating documents or (iii) result in a contravention,
breach or default under or termination of, or acceleration or permit the

Parent, including any security or obligation of any kind convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of common stock or other security
of the Parent. The issuance of the Consideration Shares pursuant to the Plan
of Arrangement will not obligate the Parent or the Purchaser to issue shares
of common stock or other securities of the Parent or the Purchaser to any
person except as contemplated in this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement
and will not result in a right of any holder of securities of the Parent or
the Purchaser to adjust the exercise, conversion, exchange or reset of price

action has been taken by any person acting on behalf of the Parent or any of
the Parent Material Subsidiaries.

 



 

(u) _Investment Canada_. The Parent is not a Canadian within the meaning of
the Investment Canada Act.

 



 

(v) _Commitment Letter; Sufficient Funds_. The Parent has delivered to the
Company true and complete fully-executed copies of a commitment letter (the "
**Commitment Letter** ") made by Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (the "
**Lender** "), evidencing the financing described therein (the " **Debt
Financing** "). The commitments described in the Commitment Letter are not
subject to any condition precedent other than the conditions expressly set
forth therein. There are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements
that would permit the Lender to reduce the amount of the Debt Financing or
that would otherwise affect the availability of the Debt Financing. The
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect, has not been amended, restated,
modified, withdrawn, terminated or otherwise modified or varied and is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Parent and, to the knowledge of the
Parent, the Lender (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors
rights generally and general principles of equity whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law), as applicable, no amendment or modification
to the Commitment Letter is contemplated (provided that the Commitment Letter
may be (or may have been) amended (i) to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Commitment Letter or (ii) otherwise so long as such amendment would not
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the completion of the Arrangement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the terms of the Commitment Letter as so amended are not materially less
beneficial to the Parent, with respect to conditionality, than the terms in
the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement), and no
event has occurred or circumstance exists, including the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which, with or without notice, lapse of time

 



      
 

 



 

or both, would or would reasonably be expected to (x) constitute a default or
breach on the part of the Parent under the Commitment Letter or (y) constitute
or result in a failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth in the
Commitment Letter assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section
8.1 and Section 8.3. All commitment and other fees or expenses required to be
paid under or in connection with the Commitment Letter on or prior to the date
hereof have been paid. The Parent does not have any reason to believe that it
shall be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing
of the Debt Financing to be satisfied by it contained in the Commitment
Letter; is not aware of any existing fact, occurrence or condition that may
cause the financing commitment contained in the Commitment Letter to terminate
or be ineffective or any of the terms or conditions of closing of the Debt
Financing not to be met or of any impediment to the funding of the cash
payment obligations of the Parent pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement or the Arrangement; and is not aware of any existing fact,
occurrence or condition that has or will cause the assumptions or statements
set forth in the Commitment Letter to be untrue or incorrect. Assuming the
Debt Financing contemplated in the Commitment Letter is funded, the net
proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letter, together with other funds
available to the Parent and the Purchaser, shall be sufficient for the
Purchaser to pay at the Effective Time in full the aggregate cash portion of
the consideration for Shares and the aggregate amount payable pursuant to the
Arrangement in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and the Plan of
Arrangement and to pay all related fees and expenses for which the Purchaser
or the Parent is responsible under the terms of the Agreement.

 



 

(w) _Full Disclosure_. The Parent Public Disclosure Record discloses all
material facts related to the Parent, the Parent Material Subsidiaries, their
respective businesses, financial conditions, assets, liabilities and
operations, in each case to the extent required to be so disclosed pursuant to
applicable U.S. Securities Laws, and no representation or warranty of the
Parent or the Purchaser contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate
furnished to the Company pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, taken
together and with the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Parent Public
Disclosure Record, contains or will contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits or will omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements herein or therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in
which they were made.

 



 

 **3.3** ** ****_Survival of Representations and Warranties_**

 



 

No investigation by or on behalf of any Party will mitigate, diminish or
affect the representations and warranties made by the other Parties. Except
for the representations and warranties contained in this Article 3, no Party
nor any other persons on behalf of a Party makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to such Party or with respect to any

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The representations and
warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement will not survive the
completion of the Arrangement and will expire and be terminated on the earlier
of the Effective Time and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms. This Section 3.3 will not limit any covenant or

 



      
 

 



 

agreement of any of the Parties, which, by its terms, contemplates performance
after the Effective Time or the date on which this Agreement is terminated, as
the case may be.

 **ARTICLE 5 _ 
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS_**

 



 

 **5.1** ** ****_Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations_**

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.1, the Company agrees that,
upon request by the Purchaser, the Company will, and will cause the Company
Entities to, at the expense of the Purchaser, use its and their commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) effect such reorganizations of the Companys or the
Company

 



      
 

 



 

Entities business, operations and assets and the integration of other
affiliated businesses of the Company as the Purchaser may request, acting
reasonably (each a " **Pre-Acquisition Reorganization** ") and (ii) cooperate
with the Purchaser and its advisors to determine the nature of the Pre-
Acquisition Reorganizations that might be undertaken and the manner in which
they most effectively could be undertaken. The Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations shall not (a) impede, delay or
prevent completion of the Arrangement (including by giving rise to Proceedings
by any person), (b) in the opinion of the Company, acting reasonably,
prejudice the Shareholders or the holders of Options or Convertible Debentures
in any material respect, (c) require the Company to obtain the approval of the
Shareholders, (d) be considered in determining whether a representation,
warranty or covenant of the Company hereunder has been breached, it being
acknowledged by the Purchaser that actions taken pursuant to any Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization could require the consent of third parties under
applicable Contracts and Government Authorities, (e) require the Company or
any Company Entity to contravene any applicable Laws, their respective
organizational documents or any Material Contract, or (f) result in any Taxes
being imposed on, or any adverse Tax or other consequences to, any
securityholder of the Company incrementally greater than the Taxes or other
consequences to such party in connection with the consummation of the
Arrangement in the absence of any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization. The
Purchaser will provide written notice to the Company of any proposed Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization at least fifteen Business Days prior to the
anticipated Effective Time. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company and the
Purchaser will, at the expense of the Purchaser, work cooperatively and use
commercially reasonable efforts to prepare prior to the Effective Time all
documentation necessary and do such other acts and things as are necessary to
give effect to such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization. The Parties will seek to
have the steps and transactions contemplated under any such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization made effective at such times (as directed by the Purchaser) on
or prior to the Effective Date (but after the Purchaser will have waived or
confirmed that all conditions referred to in Section 8.1, Section 8.2 and
Section 8.3 have been satisfied), _provided_ , _however_ , that no such Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization will be made effective unless: (A) it is reasonably
certain, after consulting with the Company, that the Arrangement will become
effective; and (B) such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization can be reversed or
unwound in a timely fashion without adversely affecting the Company and the
Company Entities in the event that the Arrangement does not become effective
and this Agreement is terminated. If the Arrangement is not completed, the
Purchaser will (a) forthwith reimburse the Company for all reasonable fees and
expenses (including any professional fees and expenses) incurred by the
Company and the Company Entities in considering and effecting any Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization, and (b) be responsible for any costs of the
Company and the Company Entities in reversing or unwinding any Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization that was effected prior to the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms. The obligation of the Purchaser to reimburse the
Company for fees and expenses and to be responsible for costs as set out in
this Section 5.1 will be in addition to any other payment the Purchaser may be
obligated to make hereunder and will survive termination of

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement. The Parent shall indemnify and save harmless the Company and
its subsidiaries from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with or as a result for their co-
operation or assistance with or participation in any Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization. No director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or its
subsidiaries shall be required to take any action in respect of a Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization in any capacity other than as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or the Company Entities, as the case may be.
Neither the Parent nor the Purchaser will contact employees of the Company or
its subsidiaries in respect of a Pre-Acquisition Reorganization, except after
prior consultation with the President and Chief Executive Officer or the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company.

 



 

(b) The Parent and the Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the planning for
and implementation of any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization shall not be
considered a breach of any covenant under this Agreement and shall not be
considered in determining whether a representation or warranty of the Company
hereunder has been breached. The Parent, the Purchaser and the Company shall
work cooperatively and use reasonable commercial efforts to prepare prior to
the Effective Time all documentation necessary and do such other acts and
things as are necessary to give effect to such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization.
For greater certainty, the Company shall not be liable for the failure of the
Parent or the Purchaser to benefit from any anticipated tax efficiency as a
result of a Pre-Acquisition Reorganization and the completion of any such
transaction shall not be a condition to the completion of the Arrangement.

 



 

 **5.2** ** ****_Access to Information_**

 



 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws and the terms of any existing
Contracts, each of the Company, the Company Entities and the Parent will, and
will cause its respective subsidiaries to, afford to the other and its
Representatives, until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, continuing access to the Company
Data Room or Parent Data Room, as the case may be, and reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to its respective
businesses, properties, books and records and such other data and information
as the other may reasonably request, as well as to their respective management
personnel, subject, however, to such access not interfering with the ordinary
conduct of its businesses. Subject to compliance with applicable Laws and such
requests not materially interfering with the ordinary conduct of the business
of the Company and the Company Entities, the Company will also make available
to the Purchaser and its Representatives all information reasonably requested
by the Purchaser for the purposes of preparing, considering and implementing
integration and strategic plans for the combined businesses of the Company and
the Purchaser and its affiliates following completion of the Arrangement.
Without limiting the generality of the provisions of the Non-Disclosure
Agreement, each of the Parties acknowledges that all information provided to
it under this Section 5.2(a), or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated hereby, is subject to the Non-Disclosure Agreement, which will
remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement or any termination of this Agreement. If any provision of this
Agreement otherwise conflicts or is inconsistent with any provision of the
Non-Disclosure Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement will supersede
those of the Non-Disclosure Agreement but only to the extent of the conflict
or inconsistency and all other provisions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.

 



 

(b) Other than as may be required in respect of information requested by
Governmental Authorities in connection with obtaining the Required Regulatory
Approvals, nothing in this Section 5.2 or in any other provision of this
Agreement will require the Company, the Company Entities or the Parent, or its
respective subsidiaries, to disclose information if such disclosure would
violate a written confidentiality agreement with a third party or customer
specific or competitively sensitive information after taking into account the
Non-Disclosure Agreement (" **Confidential Data** "). For greater certainty,
until the Effective Time, access to and exchange of Confidential Data as
between the Parties will be limited to what is reasonably necessary for the
purposes of securing all necessary regulatory approvals, the preparation and
settlement of definitive documents and the advancement of the Arrangement and
will be limited such that the dissemination of Confidential Data will be
confined to the Representatives of the Parties and their counsel who have a
need to know such information for such purposes and who agree to respect such
confidentiality in their dealings with Confidential Data. For the purpose of
this Section 5.2(b), counsel to the Purchaser shall include counsel to the
Parent.

 **5.5** ** ****_Additional Covenants with Respect to Exchangeable Share

reasonable efforts to:

Regulatory Authorities to permit the first resale of (x) the Exchangeable
Shares issued pursuant to Section 3.1(c) of the Plan of Arrangement and (y)
the Molycorp Shares issued from time to time upon exchange of such
Exchangeable Shares in accordance with their terms, in each case without
qualification with or approval of or the filing of any prospectus, or the
taking of any proceeding with, or the obtaining of any further order, ruling
or consent from, any Securities Regulatory Authorities (other than, with
respect to such first resales, any restrictions on transfer by reason of a
holder being a "control person" of the Parent, the Purchaser or Callco for
purposes of Canadian Securities Laws (collectively, the " **Exemptive Relief**
");

 



 

(ii) cause the Exchangeable Shares to be listed and posted for trading on the

listing for so long as there are any Exchangeable Shares issued and
outstanding (other than Exchangeable Shares held by the Parent or any of its
affiliates);

 



 

(iii) cause the Molycorp Shares to be issued from time to time upon exchange
of the Exchangeable Shares in accordance with their terms to be listed and
posted for trading on the NYSE;

 



       
 

 



 

(iv) ensure that the Purchaser is, at the Effective Time and for so long as
there are any Exchangeable Shares issued and outstanding (other than
Exchangeable Shares held by the Parent or any of its affiliates), a "taxable
Canadian corporation" and not a "mutual fund corporation," each within the
meaning of the Tax Act; and

 



 

(v) file a registration statement on Form S-3 in order to register the
Molycorp Shares issued from time to time upon exchange of the Exchangeable
Shares in accordance with their terms under the 1933 Securities Act (the "

cause the Registration Statement to become effective at or prior to the
Effective Time and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration for so
long as there are any Exchangeable Shares issued and outstanding (other than
Exchangeable Shares held by the Parent or any of its affiliates).

 



 

(b) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it shall execute joint
elections under subsection 85(1) or 85(2) of the Tax Act (and in each case,
where applicable, the analogous provisions of provincial income tax Laws) with
respect to the transfer of Eligible Shares to the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 3.1(c) of the Plan of Arrangement with Shareholders who are Eligible
Holders who are entitled to receive Exchangeable Shares under the Arrangement,
in each case subject to and in accordance with Section 3.4 of the Plan of
Arrangement.

 



 

 **5.6** ** ****_Additional Covenants with Respect to Financing_**

 



 

(a) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.4, the Parent shall and,
where appropriate, shall cause its subsidiaries to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to consummate any such financing arrangements (the "
**Acquisition Financing** ") as may be required in order to complete the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parent and/or the Purchaser,
as applicable, shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the
Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing, and/or substitute other debt or equity financing (" **Alternative
Financing** ") for all or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same
and/or alternative Debt Financing Sources, provided that any such amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of
the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing that amends the Debt Financing and/or substitution of all or any
portion of the Debt Financing shall not (A) expand upon the conditions
precedent to the Debt Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter or (B)
be reasonably expected to prevent or materially impede or materially delay the
availability of the Debt Financing and/or the consummation of the Arrangement
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parent and/or
the Purchaser, as applicable, shall be permitted to reduce the amount of Debt
Financing under the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing in its reasonable discretion, provided, that the
Parent shall not reduce the Debt Financing to an amount committed below the
amount that is required,

 



      
 

 



 

together with the financial resources of the Parent and the Purchaser,
including cash on hand and marketable securities of the Parent, the Purchaser,
the Company and their respective subsidiaries, to consummate the Arrangement
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and provided,
further, that such reduction shall not (A) expand upon the conditions
precedent to the Debt Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter or (B)
be reasonably expected to prevent or materially impede or materially delay the
availability of such reduced Debt Financing and/or the consummation of the
Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject
to obtaining Alternative Financing, the Parent and the Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to consummate and obtain the Debt Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, which definitive agreements will not
materially expand upon the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing as
set forth in the Commitment Letter or amend or modify the terms of the
Commitment Letter in a manner that would reasonably be expected to impair the
ability of the Parent or the Purchaser, as applicable, to consummate the Debt
Financing, and (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter that are within its control. The Parent and the Purchaser
shall and, where appropriate, shall cause their respective subsidiaries to
refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any actions that could reasonably
be expected to result in any of the conditions contained in the Commitment
Letter or in any definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing, in each
case, that are within the control of the Parent or the Purchaser, or their
respective subsidiaries, not being satisfied.

 



 

(b) The Parent shall, in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of the
Commitment Letter, deliver to the Company a copy of any definitive agreements
and related documents promptly after execution thereof and, upon the Companys
reasonable request, provide the Company with summaries of its discussions and
dealings with the Lender, provided that the Company agrees to abide by the
confidentiality provisions of the Commitment Letter. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly
(and in any event not later than 48 hours after such occurrence), if at any
time prior to the Effective Time: (a) the Commitment Letter shall expire or be
terminated for any reason; (b) the Parent reasonably determines that it shall
be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition of the Debt
Financing to be satisfied by it, that in each case would reasonably be
expected to impair the ability of the Parent or the Purchaser, as applicable,
to consummate the Debt Financing; or (c) the Lender advises the Parent in
writing that such source either no longer intends to provide or underwrite the
Debt Financing on the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter.

 



 

(c) The Parent and the Purchaser acknowledge and agree that obtaining the
Acquisition Financing (including, for greater certainty, the Debt Financing)
is not a condition to their respective obligations hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Entities to, at the
Purchasers sole expense, provide, and cause its and their respective
directors, officers, employees, independent auditors, counsel and other
Representatives to provide, to the Parent and the Purchaser all such
reasonable and timely cooperation and assistance in connection with the
arrangement of the Acquisition Financing as may be reasonably requested by the
Parent or the Purchaser or any of the lenders or their affiliates involved in
the Acquisition Financing (including, for greater certainty, the Debt
Financing), including but not limited to using its commercially reasonable
efforts to participate in meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence
sessions with the Lender, prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies,
as applicable, in connection with the Acquisition Financing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such cooperation and assistance may not materially interfere
with the conduct of the business of the Company and the Company Entities.

 



 

 **5.7** ** ****_Mutual Covenants_**

 



 

Each of the Parties covenants and agrees that, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
time that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms:

 



 

(a) it will use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy (or cause the
satisfaction of) the conditions precedent to its obligations hereunder as set
forth in Article 8 to the extent the same is within its control and to take,
or cause to be taken, all other commercially reasonable actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all other things necessary and commercially reasonable to
permit the completion of the Arrangement in accordance with its obligations
under this Agreement, the Plan of Arrangement and applicable Laws and
cooperate with the other Parties in connection therewith, including using its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain all Required Regulatory
Approvals required to be obtained by it, (ii) effect or cause to be effected
all necessary registrations, filings and submissions of information requested
by Governmental Authorities required to be effected by it in connection with
the Arrangement, (iii) oppose, lift or rescind any injunction or restraining
order against it or other order or action against it seeking to stop, or
otherwise adversely affecting its ability to make and complete, the
Arrangement and (iv) cooperate with the other Parties in connection with the
performance by it of its obligations hereunder;

 



 

(b) it will use commercially reasonable efforts not to take or cause to be
taken any action which is inconsistent with this Agreement or which would
reasonably be expected to prevent or significantly impede or materially delay
the completion of the Arrangement;

 



 

(c) it will give prompt notice to the others of: (i) the occurrence or failure
to occur of any event, which occurrence or failure would cause or may cause
any representation or warranty on its part contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Date and the termination of this
Agreement; and (ii) any failure of such Party, or any officer, director,
employee or agent thereof,

 



      
 

 



 

to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder; and

 



 

(d) it will use commercially reasonable efforts to execute and do all acts,
further deeds, things and assurances as may be required in the reasonable
opinion of the other Parties legal counsel to permit the completion of the
Arrangement.

 



 

 **5.8** ** ****_Employment Agreements; Options; Convertible Debentures_**

 



 

(a) The Purchaser agrees that the Company and any successor to the Company
(including any Surviving Corporation) shall continue to honour and comply with
the terms of all existing employment, change of control and severance
agreements of the Company and the Company Entities (as the same may be amended
or modified as permitted hereunder and thereunder), complete and correct
copies of all of which agreements have been provided to the Purchaser.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser acknowledges that, pursuant to the provisions of the Stock
Option Plan, the Company may facilitate as necessary the acceleration of
vesting of any unvested Options as may be necessary or desirable to allow the
Optionholders to exercise their Options for the purpose of participating in
the Arrangement as Shareholders. The Purchaser and the Company each
acknowledges and agrees that the Company will elect to forego any deduction
under the Tax Act with respect to the cash payments to be made by the Company
pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement to holders of Options who are a resident
of Canada for purposes of the Tax Act and, to effect the foregoing, the
Company will comply with the requirements described in subsection 110(1.1) of
the Tax Act.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser agrees that the Company and any successor to the Company
(including any Surviving Corporation) shall continue to honour and comply with
the terms of the Debenture Indenture, it being acknowledged by the Purchaser
that the Arrangement will constitute a "Cash Change of Control" as that term
is defined in the Debenture Indenture.

 



 

 **5.9** ** ****_Indemnification and Insurance_**

 



 

(a) The Company and the Purchaser agree that all rights to indemnification or
exculpation now existing in favour of the present and former directors and
officers of the Company or of any of the Company Entities (each such present
or former director or officer of the Company or of any of the Company Entities
being herein referred to as an " **Indemnified Party** " and such persons
collectively being referred to as the " **Indemnified Parties** ") as provided
in the constating documents of the Company or any of the Company Entities or
any Contract by which the Company or any of the Company Entities is bound and
which is in effect as of the date hereof, will survive the completion of the
Plan of Arrangement and continue in full force and effect and without
modification, with respect to actions or omissions of the Indemnified Parties
occurring prior to the Effective Time, for the period contemplated therein.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Purchaser will, or will cause the Company and the Company Entities to,
maintain in effect without any reduction in scope or coverage for seven (7)
years from the Effective Date customary policies of directors and officers
liability insurance providing protection no less favourable to the protection
provided by the policies maintained by the Company and the Company Entities
which are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date and providing
protection in respect of claims arising from facts or events which occurred on
or prior to the Effective Date; provided, however, that the Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding any
other provision hereof, the Company may, at its option, purchase prepaid non-
cancellable run-off directors and officers liability insurance on terms
substantially similar to the directors and officers liability policies
currently maintained by the Company, but providing coverage for a period of
seven (7) years from the Effective Date with respect to claims arising from or
related to facts or events which occurred on or prior to the Effective Date.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are and are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives and such
rights will be held by the Company, and any successor to the Company
(including any Surviving Corporation), in trust for such persons and the
Company hereby accepts such trust and agrees to hold the benefit of and
enforce performance of such covenants on behalf of each Indemnified Party, his
or her heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no approval of any beneficiary of such trust
will be required in connection with an amendment or variation of this Section
5.9 **** prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) If the Company or any of the Company Entities or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, the Purchaser shall ensure that any such
successor or assign (including, as applicable, any acquirer of substantially
all of the properties and assets of the Company or any of the Company
Entities) assumes all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 6 _ 
ACQUISITION PROPOSALS_**

 



 

 **6.1** ** ****_Non-Solicitation_**

 



 

(a) Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or to the extent that
the Purchaser has otherwise consented to in writing, until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1, neither the Board of Directors nor the Company shall,
and the Company shall cause the Company Entities and each of its and their
respective Representatives to not, directly or indirectly through any other
person:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including
by way of furnishing or affording access to information), or take any other
action that knowingly promotes or facilitates, directly or indirectly, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(ii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
provide any information with respect to, or otherwise co-operate in any way
with, or assist or participate in, encourage or otherwise facilitate, any
effort or attempt by any other person (other than the Purchaser and its
affiliates) to make or complete an Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(iii) withdraw, modify, change or qualify, or publicly propose to withdraw,
modify, change or qualify, in a manner adverse to the Purchaser or the Parent,
the approval of the Board of Directors of the transactions contemplated hereby
and the recommendation of the Board of Directors that the Shareholders vote in
favour of the Arrangement Resolution;

 



 

(iv) approve, recommend or remain neutral with respect to, or publicly propose
to approve, recommend or remain neutral with respect to, any Acquisition
Proposal (it being understood that publicly taking no position or a neutral
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the **** fifth ****
Business Day after such Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced shall
not constitute a violation of this Section 6.1(a)(iv)); or

 



 

(v) accept or enter into, or publicly propose to accept or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
agreement, arrangement or undertaking related to an Acquisition Proposal (an "
**Acquisition Agreement** ").

 



 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Entities and each of its
and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with or
involving any person (other than the Purchaser and its affiliates) conducted
heretofore by the Company or the Company Entities, or any of its or their
respective Representatives, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or which
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and, in
connection therewith, the Company will immediately discontinue access to any
person (other than the Purchaser and its affiliates) to any data room (virtual
or otherwise). The Company agrees not to release any third party from any
standstill agreement to which it is a party unless such party has made an
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, has determined in good faith
would be reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal. Within three
Business Days from the date hereof, the Company shall request the return or
destruction of all information provided to any third parties who have entered
into a confidentiality agreement with the Company since January 1, 2009
relating to any potential Acquisition Proposal and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that such requests are honoured in accordance
with the terms of such confidentiality agreements.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within 72 hours of receipt
by the Company) notify the Purchaser, at first orally and then in writing, of
any proposal, inquiry, offer or request relating to or constituting an
Acquisition Proposal, or which could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, in each case, received after the date hereof, of which
any of its Representatives is or becomes aware, or any request received by the
Company or any of its Representatives for non-public information relating to
the Company or any of the Company Entities in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal or for access to the properties, books and records or a list of
securityholders of the Company or any of the Company Entities in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall include a description of the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or proposal,
inquiry, offer or request. At the Purchasers reasonable request, the Company
will keep the Purchaser promptly and fully informed of the status, including
any change to the material terms and conditions, of any such Acquisition
Proposal, proposal, inquiry, offer or request.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding Section 6.1(a) or any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, following receipt by the Company of any proposal, inquiry, offer
or request (or any amendment thereto) that is not an Acquisition Proposal but
which the Company reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
the Company may respond to the proponent to advise it that, in accordance with
this Agreement, the Company can only enter into discussions or negotiations
with a party in accordance with Section 6.2.

 



 

 **6.2** ** ****_Right to Match_**

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding Section 6.1(a) or any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, if after the date hereof the Company or any of the Company
Entities, or any of its or their respective Representatives, receives a
written Acquisition Proposal (including, for greater certainty, an amendment,
change or modification to an Acquisition Proposal made prior to the date
hereof) that was not solicited after the date hereof in contravention of
Section 6.1, the Company and its Representatives may:

 



 

(i) contact the person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives solely for the purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions
of such Acquisition Proposal and the likelihood of its consummation so as to
determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expect
to lead to, a Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal
and that the failure to take the relevant action would conflict with its
fiduciary duties:

 



 

A. furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Entities to
the person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives provided
that (1) the Company first enters into a

 



      
 

 



 

confidentiality agreement with such person that is no less favourable to the
Company than the Non-Disclosure Agreement, and sends a copy of such agreement
to the Purchaser promptly following its execution, and (2) the Company
promptly provides to the Purchaser any material non-public information
concerning the Company or the Company Entities that is provided to such person
which was not previously provided to the Purchaser, the Parent or their
respective Representatives; and

 



 

B. engage in discussions and negotiations with respect to the Acquisition
Proposal with the person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives.

 



 

(b) Section 6.1(a) or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Company may, at any time after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Company Meeting, terminate this Agreement and accept,
approve, recommend or enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement
in respect of an Acquisition Proposal (with the exception of a confidentiality
and standstill agreement described in Section 6.2(a), the execution of which
shall not be subject to the conditions of this Section 6.2(b)) if and only if:

 



 

(i) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of Section 6.1 and
the Company has complied with the other terms of this Section 6.2;

 



 

(ii) the Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to constitute a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to take the relevant action would conflict with
its fiduciary duties;

 



 

(iii) the Company has (A) given written notice to the Purchaser of the
determination of the Board of Directors that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the Board of Directors intends to
withdraw, modify, qualify or change in a manner adverse to the Purchaser or
the Parent its approval or recommendation of the Arrangement (including the
recommendation that the Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement
Resolution) (the " **Superior Proposal Notice** ") and (B) provided the
Purchaser with a copy of the document containing such Acquisition Proposal
(together, if applicable, with a summary of the value that the Board of
Directors has, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, determined should be ascribed to any non-cash consideration
included in such Acquisition Proposal);

 



 

(iv) a period of least five full Business Days (such five Business Day Period,
the " **Right to Match Period** ") shall have elapsed from the later of the
date on which the Purchaser received the Superior Proposal Notice and the date
on which the Purchaser received a copy of the documents referred to in clause
(B) of Section 6.2(b)(iii), it being understood that the Right to

 



      
 

 



 

Match Period shall expire at 12:00 p.m. (Toronto time) at the end of the fifth
full Business Day following such later date;

 



 

(v) if the Purchaser and the Parent have offered to amend the terms of this
Agreement and the Arrangement during the Right to Match Period pursuant to
Section 6.2(c), the Board of Directors has determined, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal when assessed against this
Agreement and the Arrangement as they are proposed to be amended as at the
termination of the Right to Match Period; and

 



 

(vi) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) and
pays the Termination Payment pursuant to Section 7.2(b)(iii).

 



 

(c) During the Right to Match Period, the Purchaser and the Parent will have
the opportunity, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of this
Agreement and the Arrangement. The Company agrees that, if requested by the
Purchaser, it will negotiate with the Purchaser and the Parent in good faith
to make such amendments to the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement as
would enable it to proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby on such
amended terms. The Board of Directors will review in good faith any such offer
made by the Purchaser and the Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement and
the Arrangement in order to determine, as part of exercising its fiduciary
duties, and in consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, whether such offer to amend the terms of this Agreement and the
Arrangement would, upon its acceptance, result in the applicable Acquisition
Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal when assessed against this
Agreement and the Arrangement as they are proposed to be amended as at the
termination of the Right to Match Period. If the Board of Directors determines
that the applicable Acquisition Proposal would cease to be a Superior Proposal
when assessed against this Agreement and the Arrangement as they are proposed
to be amended as at the termination of the Right to Match Period, the Company
will forthwith so advise the Purchaser and will promptly thereafter accept the
offer by the Purchaser and the Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement and
the Arrangement and the Parties agree to take such actions and execute such
documents as are necessary to give effect to the foregoing.

 



 

(d) The Board of Directors shall reaffirm its recommendation in favour of the
Arrangement by news release promptly after (A) any Acquisition Proposal that
the Board of Directors determines not to be a Superior Proposal is publicly
announced or made or (B) the Board of Directors determines that an Acquisition
Proposal which previously constituted a Superior Proposal would cease to be a
Superior Proposal when assessed against this Agreement and the Arrangement as
they are proposed to be amended as at the termination of the Right to Match
Period. The Purchaser shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the form and content of any such news release. Such news release
shall state that the Board of Directors has determined that the applicable
Acquisition Proposal is not a Superior Proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Each successive material amendment, change or modification to any
Acquisition Proposal that results in an increase in, or modification of, the
consideration (or value of such consideration) to be received by the
Shareholders or other material terms and conditions thereof **** shall
constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this Section 6.2 and
shall result in the commencement of a new Right to Match Period from the date
specified in Section 6.2(b)(vi) with respect to such new Acquisition Proposal.
If the Company provides the Purchaser with a Superior Proposal Notice on a
date that is less than five Business Days prior to the Company Meeting, the
Company shall adjourn the Company Meeting to a date that is not later than the
tenth Business Day following the first day of the Right to Match Period.

 



 

(f) The Company shall ensure that each of the Company Entities, and each of
its and their respective Representatives, is aware of the provisions of
Section 6.1 and this Section 6.2 and the Company shall be responsible for any
breach of Section 6.1 or this Section 6.2 by such persons.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of Directors
from making a change in recommendation or from making any disclosure to any
Shareholders or holders of Convertible Debentures prior to the Effective Time,
including for greater certainty disclosure of a change in recommendation, if,
in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, failure to take such action or make such disclosure
would conflict with the Board of Directors exercise of its fiduciary duties
or such action or disclosure is otherwise required under Law (including
without limitation by responding to an Acquisition Proposal under a directors
circular or otherwise as required under applicable Law).

conditions set forth in Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 not to be satisfied; or

(ii) subject to compliance with Section 7.4, if the Purchaser or the Parent

contained in this Agreement, which breach would cause any of the conditions
set forth in Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 not to be satisfied, _provided_ ,

subject in each case to the satisfaction of the customary listing conditions
of the TSX or NYSE, as the case may be, by the Outside Date or has advised the
Company in writing that it will not be able to obtain such approval on or
before the Outside Date.

 



 

 **7.2** ** ****_Termination Fee_**

 



 

(a) If a Termination Fee Event occurs, the Company shall pay to the Purchaser
a termination fee of $30,000,000 (the " **Termination Fee** ") by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified by the
Purchaser. The Termination Fee shall in each case be payable at the time
specified in Section 7.2(b).

 



 

(b) " **Termination Fee Event** " means:

 



 

(i) the termination of this Agreement by either the Company or the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii), if (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made public or proposed publicly to the Company or the Shareholders after the
date hereof and prior to the Company Meeting and (B) the Company or one or
more of the Company Entities shall have (x) completed any Acquisition Proposal
within one year after this Agreement is terminated or (y) entered into an
Acquisition Agreement in respect of any Acquisition Proposal within one year
after this Agreement is terminated, which Acquisition Proposal, as it may be
modified or amended, is subsequently completed (whether before or after the
expiry of such one-year period), in which case the Termination Fee shall be
paid on or prior to the date on which such Acquisition Proposal is completed;

 



 

(ii) the termination of this Agreement by the Purchaser pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(i), 7.1(c)(ii) or 7.1(c)(iii), in which case the Termination Fee shall
be paid within two Business Days following the Termination Fee Event; or

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) the termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(i), in which case the Termination Fee shall be paid prior to or
concurrent with the Termination Fee Event.

 



 

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and
that without these agreements the other Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 7.2 and, in order to obtain the payment, the
Purchaser commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for
the payment set forth in this Section 7.2, the Company shall pay the Purchaser
its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount at the prime rate of the Royal Bank of Canada in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made to and including the
date on which such payment was actually received.

 



 

(d) Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set out in this
Section 7.2 are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-
estimate of the damages which the Purchaser will suffer or incur as a result
of the event giving rise to such payment and the resultant termination of this
Agreement and are not penalties. The Company irrevocably waives any right that
it may have to raise as a defense that any such liquidated damages are
excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, the Parties agree that the
payment of an amount pursuant to this Section 7.2 in the manner provided
therein is the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent and the Purchaser in
respect of the event giving rise to such payment other than the right to
injunctive relief to restrain the breach or threatened breach of the covenants
or agreements set forth in the Non-Disclosure Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 7.2, and no payment of any
such amount, shall relieve or have the effect of relieving the Company in any
way from liability for damages incurred or suffered by the Parent or the
Purchaser as a result of an intentional or wilful breach of this Agreement.
Each Debt Financing Source and its respective successors and permitted assigns
shall be express third party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to
enforce, this Section 7.2 with respect to the remedies of the Company under
this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement in no event will the
Company be required to pay any amount in excess of the Termination Fee
regardless of the number of breaches or alleged breaches of this Agreement
which may give rise to the ability to terminate this Agreement and the
requirement to pay such fee.

 



 

 **7.3** ** ****_Void upon Termination_**

 



 

If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, this Agreement
shall become void and of no force and effect and no Party will have any
liability or further obligation to the other Party hereunder, except that the
provisions of this Section 7.3, Section 5.1 (to the extent it relates to the
Purchasers obligations), Section 5.2, Section 7.2 and Article 9 (other than
Section 9.6, Section 9.9 and Section 9.10) shall survive any termination
hereof in accordance with Section 7.1, _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
the termination of this Agreement nor anything

 



      
 

 



 

contained in Section 7.2 or this Section 7.3 will relieve any Party from any
liability for any intentional or wilful breach by it of this Agreement,
including any intentional or wilful making of a misrepresentation in this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Non-Disclosure Agreement shall survive any termination hereof
in accordance with Section 7.1.

 



 

 **7.4** ** ****_Notice and Cure Provisions_**

 



 

If either the Company, on the one hand, or the Purchaser or the Parent, on the
other hand, determines at any time prior to the Effective Time that it intends
to refuse to complete the transactions contemplated hereby because of any
unfilled or unperformed condition contained in this Agreement, such Party will
so notify the other Party forthwith upon making such determination in order
that the other Party will have the right and opportunity to take such steps,
at its own expense, as may be necessary for the purpose of fulfilling or
performing such condition within a reasonable period of time, but in no event
later than the Outside Date. Neither the Company, on the one hand, nor the
Purchaser or the Parent, on the other hand, may elect not to complete the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the conditions precedent
contained in Article 8 or exercise any termination right arising therefrom and
no payments will be payable as a result of such election pursuant to Section
7.2 unless forthwith, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Party
intending to rely thereon has given a written notice to the other Party
specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations and
warranties or other matters which the Party giving such notice is asserting as
the basis for the non-fulfillment of the applicable condition precedent or the
exercise of the termination right, as the case may be. If any such notice is
given, provided that the other Party is proceeding diligently to cure such
matter, if such matter is susceptible to being cured, the Party giving such
notice may not terminate this Agreement as a result thereof until the earlier
of the Outside Date and the expiration of a period of 15 Business Days from
such notice. If such notice has been given prior to the date of the Company
Meeting, such meeting, unless the Parties otherwise agree, will be postponed
or adjourned until the expiry of such period (without causing any breach of
any other provision contained herein).

in respect of which such Dissenting Shareholder has exercised Dissent Rights
will be and be deemed to be transferred by the holder thereof to the Purchaser
(free and clear of any Liens) and such Dissenting Shareholder will cease to be
the holder thereof or to have any rights as a holder in respect of such
Dissenting Share other than the right to be paid the fair value of such
Dissenting Share determined and payable in accordance with Article 4; and

Cash Consideration, (y) the Share Consideration or (z) a combination thereof
(in each case as elected or deemed to be elected pursuant to Section 3.2 and
subject, in each case, to proration in accordance with Section 3.3); and

 



 

(ii) at the same time as the step in Section 3.1(d)(i) occurs, the holder of

Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.1(d)(i), and

(i) notwithstanding the terms of the LTIP, all vested and unvested RSUs,
Performance Units and SARs under the LTIP will be deemed to be vested, and

3.2 **Election Mechanics**

 



 

With respect to the transfer of Common Shares to the Purchaser pursuant to
Sections 3.1(c)(i) and 3.1(d)(i):

 



 

(a) each Shareholder who is an Eligible Holder may elect to receive (i) in
respect of any or all of the Common Shares held by such Eligible Holder,
either the Eligible Share Consideration or a combination of the Eligible Share
Consideration and the Cash Consideration and (ii) in respect of the balance of
the Common Shares held by such Eligible Holder, if any, either (x) the Cash
Consideration, (y) the Share Consideration or (z) a combination thereof;

 



 

(b) each Shareholder who is not an Eligible Holder may elect to receive, in
respect of each Common Share held by such Shareholder, either (i) the Cash
Consideration, (ii) the Share Consideration or (iii) a combination thereof;

 



 

(c) in order to make the election referred to in Section 3.2(a) or 3.2(b), a
Shareholder must deposit with the Depositary, by no later than the Election
Deadline, a duly completed Letter of Transmittal indicating such Shareholders
election, which election shall be irrevocable and may not be withdrawn,
together with the certificate(s) representing the Common Shares held by such
Shareholder; and

 



 

(d) any Shareholder who has not, prior to the Election Deadline, deposited
with the Depositary a duly completed Letter of Transmittal indicating such
Shareholders

 



      
 

 



 

election, together with the certificate(s) representing the Common Shares held
by such Shareholder, or otherwise fails to fully comply with the requirements
of Section 3.2(c) in respect of any Common Shares (including Shareholders who
duly exercise Dissent Rights but are ultimately not entitled, for any reason,
to be paid fair value for the Common Shares in respect of which they have
exercised Dissent Rights) shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Cash
Consideration as to 71.24% in respect of each such Common Share and the Share
Consideration as to 28.76% in respect of each such Common Share.

 



 

3.3 **Proration**

 



 

Notwithstanding Section 3.2 or any other provision herein to the contrary:

 



 

(a) Subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 3.3(b) the maximum
aggregate amount of Cash Consideration to be paid to Shareholders pursuant to
Sections 3.1(c)(i) and 3.1(d)(i) (the " **Maximum Cash Amount** ") shall be
the product of (i) $8.05 and (ii) the number of Common Shares (excluding
Common Shares in respect of which Dissent Rights have been duly exercised)
that are issued and outstanding on the Effective Date;

 



 

(b) the maximum aggregate number of Exchangeable Shares and Molycorp Shares to
be issued to Shareholders pursuant to Sections 3.1(c)(i) and 3.1(d)(i) (the "
**Maximum Share Amount** ") shall be the product of (i) 0.1220 and (ii) the
number of Common Shares (excluding Common Shares in respect of which Dissent
Rights have been duly exercised) that are issued and outstanding on the
Effective Date **;** _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the
Maximum Share Amount is, on the Effective Date, equal to or in excess of 20%
of the then issued and outstanding Molycorp Shares, then (x) the Maximum Share
Amount shall be reduced to that number of shares (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) representing 19.99% of the Molycorp Shares then issued and
outstanding and (y) the Maximum Cash Amount shall be increased by a
proportionate amount;

 



 

(c) in the event that the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration elected or
deemed to be elected by Shareholders pursuant to Section 3.2 exceeds the
Maximum Cash Amount, prior to giving effect to this Section 3.3(c), then:

 



 

(i) the percentage of the purchase price in respect of each Common Share
(including Eligible Shares) transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to Sections
3.1(c)(i) and 3.1(d)(i) to be paid in cash (the " **Deemed Cash Election
Percentage** ") shall be determined by multiplying (x) the percentage of the
purchase price in respect of such Common Share to be paid in cash as otherwise
determined in accordance with Section 3.2 prior to giving effect to this
Section 3.3(c) (the " **Actual Cash Election Percentage** ") by (y) a
fraction, rounded to six decimal places, the numerator of which is the Maximum
Cash Amount and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of the Cash
Consideration otherwise payable to all Shareholders pursuant to Sections
3.1(c)(i) and 3.1(d)(i) prior to giving effect to this Section 3.3(c); and

 



 

(ii) the percentage of the purchase price in respect of each Common Share
(including Eligible Shares) transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to Sections
3.1(c)(i) and 3.1(d)(i) to be paid in Exchangeable Shares or

 



      
 

 



 

Molycorp Shares, as the case may be, shall be increased by a percentage equal
to the difference between (x) the Deemed Cash Election Percentage in respect
of such Common Share and (y) the Actual Cash Election Percentage in respect of
such Common Share; and

 



 

(d) in the event that the aggregate amount of Eligible Share Consideration and
Share Consideration elected or deemed to be elected by Shareholders pursuant
to Section 3.2 exceeds the Maximum Share Amount, prior to giving effect to
this Section 3.3(d), then:

 



 

(i) the percentage of the purchase price in respect of each Common Share
(including Eligible Shares) transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to Sections
3.1(c)(i) and 3.1(d)(i) to be paid in Exchangeable Shares or Molycorp Shares,
as the case may be (the " **Deemed Share Election Percentage** "), shall be
determined by multiplying (x) the percentage of the purchase price in respect
of such Common Share to be paid in Exchangeable Shares or Molycorp Shares, as
the case may be, as otherwise determined in accordance with Section 3.2 prior
to giving effect to this Section 3.3(d) (the " **Actual Share Election
Percentage** ") by (y) a fraction, rounded to six decimal places, the
numerator of which is the Maximum Share Amount and the denominator of which is
the aggregate amount of the Eligible Share Consideration and Share
Consideration otherwise issuable to all Shareholders pursuant to Sections
3.1(c)(i) and 3.1(d)(i) prior to giving effect to this Section 3.3(d); and

 



 

(ii) the percentage of the purchase price in respect of each Common Share
(including Eligible Shares) transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to Sections
3.1(c)(i) and 3.1(d)(i) to be paid in cash shall be increased by a percentage
equal to the difference between (x) the Deemed Share Election Percentage in
respect of such Common Share and (y) the Actual Share Election Percentage in
respect of such Common Share.

 



 

3.4 **Income Tax Elections**

 



 

Shareholders who are Eligible Holders who are entitled to receive Exchangeable
Shares under the Arrangement shall be entitled to make an income tax election
pursuant to subsection 85(1) of the Tax Act or, if the person is a
partnership, subsection 85(2) of the Tax Act (and in each case, where
applicable, the analogous provisions of provincial income tax Laws) with
respect to the transfer of their Eligible Shares to the Purchaser by providing
the Tax Election Package to the Depositary within 90 days following the
Effective Date, duly completed with the details of the number of Eligible
Shares transferred and the applicable agreed amounts (which cannot be less
than the fair market value of the Ancillary Rights at the Effective Time).
Thereafter, subject to the Tax Election Package being correct and complete and
complying with the provisions of the Tax Act (or applicable provincial income
or corporate tax Laws), the relevant forms will be signed by the Purchaser and
returned to such persons within 90 days after the receipt thereof by the
Depositary for filing with the Canada Revenue Agency (or the applicable
provincial taxing agency). The Purchaser will not be responsible for the
proper or accurate completion of the Tax Election Package or for checking or
verifying the content of any election form and, except for the Purchasers
obligation to return duly completed Tax Election Packages which are received
by

 



      
 

 



 

the Depositary within 90 days of the Effective Date, within 90 days after the
receipt thereof by the Depositary, the Purchaser will not be responsible for
any taxes, interest or penalties or any other costs or damages resulting from
the failure by a Shareholder to properly and accurately complete or file the
necessary election forms in the form and manner and within the time prescribed
by the Tax Act (or any applicable provincial legislation). In its sole
discretion, the Purchaser may choose to sign and return Tax Election Packages
received more than 90 days following the Effective Date but will have no
obligation to do so.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 4 _ 
DISSENT RIGHTS_**

 



 

4.1 **Rights of Dissent**

 



 

Pursuant to the Interim Order, each registered Shareholder may exercise rights
of dissent (" **Dissent Rights** ") pursuant to and in the manner set forth in
section 190 of the CBCA, as modified by this Article 4 and the Interim Order;
_provided_ , _however_ , that written objection to the Arrangement Resolution,
in the manner contemplated by section 190(5) of the CBCA, must be sent to and
received by the Company by no later than 4:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the
second Business Day immediately prior to the Company Meeting. Shareholders who
duly exercise such rights of dissent and who:

 



 

(a) are ultimately determined to be entitled to be paid by the Purchaser fair
value for the Common Shares in respect of which they have exercised Dissent
Rights will be deemed to have irrevocably transferred such Common Shares to
the Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) in consideration of such fair
value; or

 



 

(b) are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid by the Purchaser
fair value for the Common Shares in respect of which they have exercised
Dissent Rights will be deemed to have participated in the Arrangement on the
same basis as a Shareholder who has not exercised Dissent Rights, as at and
from the time specified in Section 3.1(d) and be entitled to receive only the
consideration set forth in Section 3.1(d)(i);

 



 

but in no case will the Company or the Purchaser or any other person be
required to recognize such holders as holders of Common Shares after the
completion of the steps set forth in Section 3.1(b) or 3.1(d), as the case may
be, and each Dissenting Shareholder will cease to be entitled to the rights of
a Shareholder in respect of the Common Shares in relation to which such
Dissenting Shareholder has exercised Dissent Rights and the central securities
register of the Company will be amended to reflect that such former holder is
no longer the holder of such Common Shares as and from the Effective Time. For
greater certainty, and in addition to any other restriction under section 190
of the CBCA, a Shareholder who has voted, or instructed a proxyholder to vote,
against the Arrangement Resolution shall not be entitled to exercise Dissent
Rights with respect to the Arrangement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 5 _ 
CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENTS_**

 



 

5.1 **Payments of Consideration**

 



 

(a) At or before the Effective Time, the Purchaser will deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Depositary for the benefit of the Shareholders, the
Optionholders and the holders of RSUs, Performance Units, SARs and DSUs:

 



 

(i) cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to satisfy the Companys payment
obligations contemplated by Sections 3.1(a)(i), 3.1(e)(i) and 3.1(f)(i);

 



 

(ii) cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to satisfy the payment obligations
contemplated by Sections 3.1(c)(i) and 3.1(d)(i) (calculated without reference
to whether any Shareholder has exercised Dissent Rights); and

 



 

(iii) one or more certificates representing the aggregate number of
Exchangeable Shares and Molycorp Shares required to be delivered by the
Purchaser to the Shareholders pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(i) and 3.1(d)(i)
(calculated without reference to whether any Shareholder has exercised Dissent
Rights).

 



 

(b) As soon as practicable following the later of the Effective Date and the
surrender by a Shareholder (other than a Dissenting Shareholder) to the
Depositary of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Common Shares (including Eligible Shares) that were
transferred to the Purchaser under Sections 3.1(c)(i) and 3.1(d)(i), together
with a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and such additional documents and
instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the former holder of
such Common Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) a
cheque for the Cash Consideration, if any, such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(i) and/or Section 3.1(d)(i) and (ii) a certificate
representing that number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of
Exchangeable Shares and/or Molycorp Shares, if any, such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(i) and/or Section 3.1(d)(i), together with
any distributions or dividends which such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 5.2, less, in the case of both clauses (i) and (ii), any
amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.6, and any certificate so surrendered
will forthwith be cancelled.

 



 

(c) Subject to Section 5.5, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
5.1, each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Common Shares (including Eligible Shares) that were transferred to
the Purchaser under Section 3.1(c)(i) or Section 3.1(d)(i) will be thereafter
deemed to represent only the right to receive (i) a cheque for the Cash
Consideration, if any, the holder of such Common Shares is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(i) and/or Section 3.1(d)(i) and (ii) a certificate
representing that number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of
Exchangeable Shares and/or Molycorp Shares, if any, such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(i) and/or Section 3.1(d)(i), together with
any distributions or dividends which such holder is

 



       
 

 



 

entitled to receive pursuant to Section 5.2, less, in the case of both clauses
(i) and (ii), any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.6.

 



 

(d) The Purchaser will cause the Depositary, as soon as a former holder of
Common Shares (including Eligible Shares) becomes entitled to receive Cash
Consideration and/or Eligible Share Consideration and/or Share Consideration
in accordance with Section 5.1(b), to:

 



 

(i) forward or cause to be forwarded by first class mail (postage paid) to
such former holder at the address specified in the Letter of Transmittal; or

 



 

(ii) if requested by such former holder in the Letter of Transmittal, make
available at the offices of the Depositary specified in the Letter of
Transmittal for pick-up by such former holder; or

 



 

(iii) if the Letter of Transmittal neither specifies an address as described
in Section 5.1(d)(i) nor contains a request as described in Section
5.1(d)(ii), forward or cause to be forwarded by first class mail (postage
paid) to such former holder at the address of such former holder as shown on
the applicable securities register maintained by or on behalf of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

a cheque representing the Cash Consideration payable to such former holder in
accordance with the provisions hereof and one or more certificates
representing the Eligible Share Consideration and/or Share Consideration to
which such former holder of Common Shares is entitled to receive in accordance
with the provisions hereof, in each case less any amounts withheld pursuant to
Section 5.6.

 



 

(e) No former holder of Common Shares shall be entitled to receive any
consideration with respect to such Common Shares other than the Cash
Consideration and/or Eligible Share Consideration and/or Share Consideration
such former holder of Common Shares is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section 5.1 and, for greater certainty, no such former holder will be entitled
to receive any interest, dividends, premium or other payment in connection
therewith except in accordance with Section 5.2.

 



 

(f) The Purchaser will cause the Depositary, as soon as a former Optionholder
or former holder of RSUs, Performance Units, SARs or DSUs becomes entitled to
receive the payments contemplated by Sections 3.1(a)(i), 3.1(e)(i) and
3.1(f)(i), to forward or cause to be forwarded by first class mail (postage
paid) to such former holder at the address specified in the applicable records
of the Company, a cheque representing the cash payment payable to such former
holder in accordance with the provisions hereof. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing terms of this Section 5.1, neither a certificate nor a letter of
transmittal need be surrendered by a former holder of Options, RSUs,
Performance Units, SARs or DSUs in order to receive the cash to which such
former holder is entitled pursuant to Sections 3.1(a)(i), 3.1(e)(i) and
3.1(f)(i).

 



      
 

 



 

5.2 **Dividends and Distributions**

 



 

No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to the Exchangeable Shares or Molycorp Shares with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Common Shares (including Eligible Shares) that were transferred
pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(i) or Section 3.1(d)(i), and no cash payment
constituting the Cash Consideration or made in lieu of fractional Exchangeable
Shares or Molycorp Shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
5.3, unless and until the holder of such certificate shall surrender such
certificate in accordance with Section 5.1. Subject to applicable law, at the
time of such surrender of any such certificate (or, in the case of clause
(iii) below, at the appropriate payment date), there shall be paid to the
holder of the certificates representing Common Shares (including Eligible
Shares) (without interest) (i) the amount of cash comprising the Cash
Consideration, if any, such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
3.1(c)(i) or Section 3.1(d)(i) or payable in lieu of a fractional Exchangeable
Share or Molycorp Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
5.3, (ii) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to the Exchangeable

entitled to a fractional Exchangeable Share or Molycorp Share. Where the
aggregate number of Exchangeable Shares or Molycorp Shares to be issued to a
holder of Common Shares as consideration under this Arrangement would result
in a fraction of an Exchangeable Share or a Molycorp Share being issuable, the
number of Exchangeable Shares or Molycorp Shares to be received by such holder
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Exchangeable Share or Molycorp
Share, as the case may be, and, in lieu of a fractional Exchangeable Share or
Molycorp Share, the holder will receive a cash payment in Canadian dollars
(rounded down to the nearest cent) determined on the basis of an amount equal
to the Canadian Dollar Equivalent of (i) the volume weighted average trading
price on the NYSE of the Molycorp Shares over the five Business Days ending
one Business Day before the Effective Date _multiplied_ by (ii) the fractional
share amount. All cash payable in lieu of fractional Exchangeable Shares and
Molycorp Shares will be denominated in Canadian dollars.

 



 

5.4 **Loss of Certificates**

 



 

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Common Shares (including Eligible Shares)
that were acquired by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(i) or Section
3.1(d)(i) has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the former holder of such Common Shares, the Depositary will,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, deliver to such
former holder of Common Shares (a) the Cash Consideration and/or Eligible
Share Consideration such former holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 3.1(c)(i) and/or (b) the Cash Consideration and/or Share Consideration
such former holder is entitled to receive in respect of

 



      
 

 



 

such Common Shares pursuant to Section 3.1(d)(i) together, in each case, with
any distributions or dividends which such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 5.2 and less, in each case, any amounts withheld pursuant
to Section 5.6. When authorizing such payment in relation to any lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, the former holder of such Common Shares will, as a
condition precedent to the delivery thereof, give a bond satisfactory to the
Purchaser and the Depositary or otherwise indemnify the Company, the
Purchaser, the Parent and the Depositary against any claim that may be made
against any of them with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 



 

5.5 **Extinction of Rights**

 



 

Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one
or more outstanding Common Shares (including Eligible Shares) that were
acquired by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(i) or Section 3.1(d)(i)
which is not deposited with the Depositary in accordance with the provisions
of Section 5.1 on or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall,
on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date, cease to represent a claim or
interest of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether as a securityholder or
otherwise and whether against the Company, the Purchaser, the Parent, the
Depositary or any other person. On such date, the Cash Consideration and/or
Eligible Share Consideration and/or Share Consideration such former holder of
Common Shares would otherwise have been entitled to receive, together with any
distributions or dividends such holder would otherwise have been entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 5.2, shall be deemed to have been surrendered for
no consideration to the Purchaser. Neither the Company nor the Purchaser or
the Parent will be liable to any person in respect of any cash or securities
(including any cash or securities previously held by the Depositary in trust
for any such former holder) which is forfeited to the Purchaser or delivered
to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law.

 



 

5.6 **Withholding Rights**

 



 

The Company, the Purchaser and the Depositary will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any Shareholder under
this Plan of Arrangement (including any payment to Dissenting Shareholders)
such amounts as the Company, the Purchaser or the Depositary is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax Act, the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of any provincial, state, local or
foreign tax law as counsel may advise is required to be so deducted and
withheld by the Company, the Purchaser or the Depositary, as the case may be.
For the purposes hereof, all such withheld amounts shall be treated as having
been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made on account of the obligation to make payment to such person hereunder,
provided that such deducted or withheld amounts are actually remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authority by or on behalf of the Company, the
Purchaser or the Depositary, as the case may be.

entitled to exercise the Liquidation Call Right with respect to those
Exchangeable Shares, if any, in respect of which the Parent has not exercised
the Liquidation Call Right, the Parent and Callco shall each have the
overriding right (the " **Liquidation Call Right** "), in the event of and
notwithstanding the proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the
Purchaser or any other distribution of the assets of the Purchaser among its
shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, pursuant to Section 5
of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase from all but not less than
all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of
Exchangeable Shares which is the Parent or an affiliate of the Parent) on the
Liquidation Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by
each such holder on payment by the Parent or Callco, as the case may be, to
each such holder of the Exchangeable Share Price (payable in the form of the
Exchangeable Share Consideration) applicable on the last Business Day prior to
the Liquidation Date (the " **Liquidation Call Purchase Price** ") in
accordance with Section 6.1(c). In the event of the exercise of the
Liquidation Call Right by the Parent or Callco, as the case may be, each such
holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be obligated to sell all of the
Exchangeable Shares held by the holder to the Parent or Callco, as the case

case may be, to such holder of the Liquidation Call Purchase Price (payable in
the form of Exchangeable Share Consideration) for each such share, and the
Purchaser shall have no obligation to pay any Liquidation Amount to the
holders of such shares so purchased.

 



 

(b) Callco shall only be entitled to exercise the Liquidation Call Right with
respect to those Exchangeable Shares, if any, in respect of which the Parent
has not exercised the Liquidation Call Right. To exercise the Liquidation Call
Right, the Parent or Callco must notify the Transfer Agent, as agent for the
holders of Exchangeable Shares, and the Purchaser of its intention to exercise
such right (i) in the case of a voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-
up of the Purchaser or any other voluntary distribution of the assets of the
Purchaser among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, at
least 30 days before the Liquidation Date or (ii) in the case of an
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Purchaser or any
other involuntary distribution of the assets of the Purchaser among its
shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, at least five Business
Days before the Liquidation Date. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders
of Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not the Parent and/or Callco has
exercised the Liquidation Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period
during which the Parent or Callco may exercise the Liquidation Call Right.

 



      
 

 



 

If the Parent and/or Callco exercises the Liquidation Call Right, the Parent
and/or Callco, as the case may be, will purchase and the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is the
Parent or an affiliate of the Parent) will sell, on the Liquidation Date, all
of the Exchangeable Shares held by such holders on such date for a price per
share equal to the Liquidation Call Purchase Price (payable in the form of
Exchangeable Share Consideration).

 



 

(c) For the purposes of completing the purchase and sale of the Exchangeable
Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Liquidation Call Right, the Parent
and/or Callco, as the case may be, shall deposit or cause to be deposited with
the Transfer Agent, on or before the Liquidation Date, the Exchangeable Share
Consideration representing the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price less any
amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.6. Provided that such Exchangeable
Share Consideration has been so deposited with the Transfer Agent, the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be holders of the Exchangeable
Shares on and after the Liquidation Date and, from and after such date, shall
not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof
(including any rights under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement) other
than the right to receive their proportionate part of the total Liquidation
Call Purchase Price, without interest, upon presentation and surrender by the
holder of certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such
holder and the holder shall on and after the Liquidation Date be considered
and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the Molycorp Shares which such
holder is entitled to receive. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a
certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, together with
such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer
of Exchangeable Shares under the BCBCA and the articles and by-laws of the
Purchaser, and such additional documents, instruments and payments as the
Transfer Agent and the Purchaser may reasonably require, the holder of such
surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive, in
exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of the Parent and/or
Callco, as the case may be, shall deliver to such holder the Exchangeable
Share Consideration such holder is entitled to receive. If neither the Parent
nor Callco exercises the Liquidation Call Right in the manner described above,
each holder of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive, on the
Liquidation Date, the Liquidation Amount otherwise payable by the Purchaser in
respect of the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder in connection with the
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Purchaser or any distribution of
the assets of the Purchaser among its shareholders for the purpose of winding
up its affairs pursuant to Section 5 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions.

 



 

6.2 **Redemption Call Right.**

 



 

In addition to the rights contained in the Exchangeable Share Provisions

(a) Subject to the proviso in Section 6.2(b) that Callco shall only be
entitled to exercise the Redemption Call Right with respect to those
Exchangeable Shares, if any, in respect of which the Parent has not exercised
the Redemption Call Right, and notwithstanding the proposed redemption of the
Exchangeable Shares by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 7 of the Exchangeable
Share Provisions, the Parent and Callco shall each have the overriding right
(the " **Redemption Call Right** ") to purchase from all but not less than all
of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable
Shares which is the Parent or an affiliate of the Parent) on the Redemption
Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such
holder on payment by the Parent or Callco, as the case may be, to each such
holder of the Exchangeable Share Price (payable in the form of the
Exchangeable Share Consideration) applicable on the last Business Day prior to
the Redemption Date (the " **Redemption Call Purchase Price** ") in accordance
with Section 6.2(c). In the event of the exercise of the Redemption Call Right
by the Parent or Callco, as the case may be, each such holder shall be
obligated to sell all of the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder to the
Parent or Callco, as the case may be, on the Redemption Date on payment by the
Parent or Callco, as the case may be, to such holder of the Redemption Call
Purchase Price (payable in the form of Exchangeable Share Consideration) for
each such share, and the Purchaser shall have no obligation to redeem, or to
pay the Redemption Price (as defined in the Exchangeable Share Provisions) in
respect of, such shares so purchased.

 



 

(b) Callco shall only be entitled to exercise the Redemption Call Right with
respect to those Exchangeable Shares, if any, in respect of which the Parent
has not exercised the Redemption Call Right. To exercise the Redemption Call
Right, the Parent or Callco must notify the Transfer Agent, as agent for the
holders of Exchangeable Shares, and the Purchaser of its intention to exercise
such right (i) in the case of a redemption occurring as a result of a Molycorp
Control Transaction, an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt
Exchangeable Share Voting Event, on or before the Redemption Date and (ii) in
any other case, at least 30 days before the Redemption Date. The Transfer
Agent will notify the holders of the Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not
the Parent and/or Callco has exercised the Redemption Call Right forthwith
after the expiry of the period during which the Parent or Callco may exercise
the Redemption Call Right. If the Parent and/or Callco exercises the
Redemption Call Right, the Parent and/or Callco, as the case may be, will
purchase and the holders of the Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of
Exchangeable Shares which is the Parent or an affiliate of the Parent) will
sell, on the Redemption Date, all of the Exchangeable Shares held by such
holders on such date for a price per share equal to the Redemption Call
Purchase Price (payable in the form of Exchangeable Share Consideration).

 



 

(c) For the purposes of completing the purchase and sale of the Exchangeable
Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Redemption Call Right, the Parent
and/or Callco, as the case may be, shall deposit or cause to be deposited with
the Transfer Agent, on or before the Redemption Date, the Exchangeable Share
Consideration representing the total Redemption Call Purchase Price less any
amounts withheld

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to Section 5.6. Provided that such Exchangeable Share Consideration
has been so deposited with the Transfer Agent, the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares shall cease to be holders of the Exchangeable Shares on and after the
Redemption Date and, from and after such date, shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof (including any rights
under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement) other than the right to receive
their proportionate part of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price, without
interest, upon presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates
representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall
on and after the Redemption Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to
be the holder of the Molycorp Shares which such holder is entitled to receive.
Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates
representing Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares
under the BCBCA and the articles and by-laws of the Purchaser, and such

or certificates shall be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor, and the
Transfer Agent on behalf of the Parent and/or Callco, as the case may be,
shall deliver to such holder the Exchangeable Share Consideration such holder
is entitled to receive. If neither the Parent nor Callco exercises the
Redemption Call Right in the manner described above, each holder of the
Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive, on the Redemption Date, the
redemption price otherwise payable by the Purchaser in respect of the

Change of Law, to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of
Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is the
Parent or an affiliate of the Parent) on the Change of Law Call Date all but
not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder on
payment by the Parent or Callco, as the case may be, to each such holder of
the Exchangeable Share Price (payable in the form of the Exchangeable Share
Consideration) applicable on the last Business Day prior to the Change of Law
Call Date (the " **Change of Law Call Purchase Price** ") in accordance with

each such share.

 



 

(b) Callco shall only be entitled to exercise the Change of Law Call Right
with respect to those Exchangeable Shares, if any, in respect of which the

respect to the payment of dividends as and to the extent provided in Section 3
and (b) with respect to the distribution of assets in the event of the
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or
involuntary, or any other distribution of the assets of the Company among its
shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs as and to the extent
provided in Section 5.

 



 

 **3.** ** ****Dividends**

 



 

(a) _Dividends_. A holder of an Exchangeable Share shall be entitled to
receive and the Board of Directors shall, subject to applicable law, on each
Molycorp Dividend Declaration Date, declare a dividend on each Exchangeable
Share:

 



 

(i) in the case of a cash dividend or distribution declared on the Molycorp
Shares, in an amount in cash for each Exchangeable Share equal to the Canadian
Dollar Equivalent of the cash dividend or distribution declared on each
Molycorp Share on the Molycorp Dividend Declaration Date;

 



 

(ii) in the case of a stock dividend or distribution declared on the Molycorp
Shares to be paid in Molycorp Shares, by the issue or transfer by the Company
of such number of Exchangeable Shares for each Exchangeable Share as is equal
to the number of Molycorp Shares to be paid on each Molycorp Share; provided,
however, that the Company may, in lieu of such stock dividend, elect to effect
a contemporaneous and economically equivalent (as determined by the Board of
Directors in accordance with Section 3(e)) subdivision of the outstanding
Exchangeable Shares; or

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) in the case of a dividend or distribution declared on the Molycorp
Shares in property other than cash or Molycorp Shares, in such type and amount
of property for each Exchangeable Share as is the same as or economically
equivalent (as determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with Section
3(e)) to the type and amount of property declared as a dividend or
distribution on each Molycorp Share.

 



 

Such dividends or distributions shall be paid out of money, assets or property
of the Company properly applicable to the payment of dividends, or out of
authorized but unissued shares of the Company, as applicable. The holders of
Exchangeable Shares shall not be entitled to any dividends other than or in
excess of the dividends referred to in this Section 3(a).

 



 

(b) _Payments of Dividends_. Cheques of the Company payable at par at any
branch of the bankers of the Company shall be issued in respect of any cash
dividends or distributions contemplated by Section 3(a)(i) and the sending of
such cheque to each holder of an Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the cash
dividend or distribution represented thereby unless the cheque is not paid on
presentation. Written evidence of the book entry issuance or transfer to the
registered holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be delivered in respect of any
stock dividends or distributions contemplated by Section 3(a)(ii) and the
sending of such written evidence to each holder of an Exchangeable Share shall
satisfy the stock dividend or distribution represented thereby. Such other
type and amount of property in respect of any dividends or distributions
contemplated by Section 3(a)(iii) shall be issued, distributed or transferred
by the Company in such manner as it shall determine and the issuance,
distribution or transfer thereof by the Company to each holder of an
Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the dividend or distribution represented
thereby. Subject to the requirements of applicable law with respect to
unclaimed property, no holder of an Exchangeable Share shall be entitled to
recover by action or other legal process against the Company any dividend that
is represented by a cheque that has not been duly presented to the Companys
bankers for payment or that otherwise remains unclaimed for a period of six
years from the date on which such dividend was payable.

 



 

(c) _Record and Payment Dates_. The record date for the determination of the
holders of Exchangeable Shares entitled to receive payment of, and the payment
date for, any dividend or distribution declared on the Exchangeable Shares
under Section 3(a) shall be the same dates as the record date and payment
date, respectively, for the corresponding dividend or distribution declared on
the Molycorp Shares. The record date for the determination of the holders of
Exchangeable Shares entitled to receive Exchangeable Shares in connection with
any subdivision of the Exchangeable Shares under Section 3(a)(ii) and the
effective date of such subdivision shall be the same dates as the record and
payment date, respectively, for the corresponding stock dividend or
distribution declared on the Molycorp Shares.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Partial Payment_. If on any payment date for any dividends or
distributions declared on the Exchangeable Shares under Section 3(a) the
dividends or distributions are not paid in full on all of the Exchangeable
Shares then outstanding, any such dividends or distributions that remain
unpaid shall be paid on a subsequent date or dates determined by the Board of
Directors on which the Company shall have sufficient moneys, assets or
property properly applicable to the payment of such dividends or
distributions.

 



 

(e) _Economic Equivalence_. The Board of Directors shall determine, in good
faith and in its sole discretion (with the assistance of such financial or
other advisors as the Board of Directors may determine), "economic
equivalence" for the purposes of the Exchangeable Share Provisions and each
such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and its
shareholders. In making each such determination, the following factors shall,
without excluding other factors determined by the Board of Directors to be
relevant, be considered by the Board of Directors:

 



 

(i) in the case of any stock dividend or other distribution payable in
Molycorp Shares, the number of such shares issued in proportion to the number
of Molycorp Shares previously outstanding;

 



 

(ii) in the case of the issuance or distribution of any rights, options or
warrants to subscribe for or purchase Molycorp Shares (or securities
exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Molycorp
Shares), the relationship between the exercise price of each such right,
option or warrant, the Current Market Price of a Molycorp Share, the
volatility of the Molycorp Shares and the terms of any such instrument;

 



 

(iii) in the case of the issuance or distribution of any other form of
property (including any shares or securities of Molycorp of any class other
than Molycorp Shares, any rights, options or warrants other than those
referred to in Section 3(e)(ii), any evidences of indebtedness of Molycorp or
any assets of Molycorp), the relationship between the fair market value (as
determined by the Board of Directors in the manner above contemplated) of such
property to be issued or distributed with respect to each outstanding Molycorp
Share and the Current Market Price of a Molycorp Share;

 



 

(iv) in the case of any subdivision, redivision or change of the then
outstanding Molycorp Shares into a greater number of Molycorp Shares or the
reduction, combination, consolidation or change of the then outstanding
Molycorp Shares into a lesser number of Molycorp Shares or any amalgamation,
merger, arrangement, reorganization or other transaction affecting the
Molycorp Shares, the effect thereof upon the then outstanding Exchangeable
Shares; and

 



      
 

 



 

(v) in all such cases, the general taxation consequences of the relevant event
to holders of Exchangeable Shares to the extent that such consequences may
differ from the taxation consequences to holders of Molycorp Shares as a
result of differences between taxation laws of Canada and the United States
(except for any differing consequences arising as a result of differing
withholding taxes and marginal taxation rates and without regard to the
individual circumstances of holders of Exchangeable Shares).

 



 

 **4.** ** ****Certain Restrictions**

 



 

So long as any of the Exchangeable Shares are outstanding, the Company shall
not at any time without, but may at any time with, the approval of the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares given as specified in Section 11(a):

 



 

(a) pay any dividends on the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior
to the Exchangeable Shares with respect to the payment of dividends, other
than stock dividends payable in Common Shares or any such other shares ranking
junior to the Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be;

 



 

(b) redeem or purchase or make any capital distribution in respect of Common
Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares with
respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of the assets in the
event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether
voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of the assets of the
Company among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs;

 



 

(c) redeem or purchase or make any capital distribution in respect of any
other shares of the Company ranking equally with the Exchangeable Shares with
respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets in the event
of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether
voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of the assets of the
Company among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs;

 



 

(d) issue any Exchangeable Shares or any other shares of the Company ranking
equally with the Exchangeable Shares other, in each case, than by way of stock
dividends to the holders of such Exchangeable Shares; or

 



 

(e) issue any shares of the Company ranking superior to the Exchangeable
Shares,

 



 

provided, however, that the restrictions in Sections 4(a), (b), (c) and (d)
shall not apply if all dividends on the outstanding Exchangeable Shares
corresponding to dividends declared and paid to date on the Molycorp Shares
shall have been declared and paid in full on the Exchangeable Shares and
provided that the proposed redemption, purchase or other capital distribution
does not impair the Companys ability to redeem all of the outstanding
Exchangeable Shares.

 



       
 

 



 

 **5.** ** ****Liquidation**

 



 

(a) _Liquidation Amount_. Subject to applicable law and the due exercise by
Molycorp or Callco of the Liquidation Call Right, in the event of the
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company or any other
distribution of the assets of the Company among its shareholders for the
purpose of winding up its affairs, a holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be
entitled, subject to applicable law, to receive from the assets of the Company
in respect of each Exchangeable Share held by such holder on the effective
date of such liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or other distribution (the "
**Liquidation Date** "), before any distribution of any part of the assets of
the Company among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking
junior to the Exchangeable Shares, an amount per share (the " **Liquidation
Amount** ") equal to the Exchangeable Share Price applicable on the last
Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which price shall be satisfied in
full by the Company delivering or causing to be delivered to such holder the
Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the Liquidation Amount .

 



 

(b) _Payment of Liquidation Amount_. In the case of a distribution pursuant to
Section 5(a), and provided that the Liquidation Call Right has not been
exercised by Molycorp or **** Callco, on or promptly after the Liquidation
Date, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount for each such Exchangeable Share
upon presentation and surrender of the certificates representing such
Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may
be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the BCBCA and
the articles and by-laws of the Company and such additional documents,
instruments and payments as the Transfer Agent and the Company may reasonably
require, at the registered office of the Company or at any office of the
Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Company by notice to the holders of
the Exchangeable Shares. Payment of the Liquidation Amount for such
Exchangeable Shares shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address
of the holder recorded in the securities register of the Company for the
Exchangeable Shares or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered
office of the Company or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be
specified by the Company by notice to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares,
the Exchangeable Share Consideration such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 5(a). On and after the Liquidation Date, the holders of
the Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares
and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect
thereof (including any rights under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement)
other than the right to receive their proportionate part of the total
Liquidation Amount, unless payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such
Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of share
certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the
rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the Liquidation Amount has
been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. The Company shall have the
right at any time after the Liquidation Date to transfer or cause to be issued
or transferred to, and deposited in a custodial account with, any chartered
bank or trust company the Liquidation Amount in respect of the Exchangeable
Shares represented by certificates that

 



      
 

 



 

have not at the Liquidation Date been surrendered by the holders thereof, such
Liquidation Amount to be held by such bank or trust company as trustee for and
on behalf of, and for the use and benefit of, such holders. Upon such deposit
being made, the rights of a holder of Exchangeable Shares after such deposit
shall be limited to receiving its proportionate part of the total Liquidation
Amount for such Exchangeable Shares so deposited, without interest, and all
dividends and other distributions with respect to the Molycorp Shares to which
such holder is entitled with a record date after the date of such deposit and
before the date of transfer of such Molycorp Shares to such holder (in each
case less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and
withheld therefrom) against presentation and surrender of the certificates for
the Exchangeable Shares held by them in accordance with the foregoing
provisions.

 



 

(c) _No Right to Participate in Further Distributions_. After the Company has
satisfied its obligations to pay the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the
total Liquidation Amount per Exchangeable Share pursuant to this Section 5,
such holders shall not be entitled to share in any further distribution of the
assets of the Company.

 



 

 **6.** ** ****Retraction of Exchangeable Shares**

 



 

(a) _Retraction at Option of Holder_

 



 

(i) Subject to applicable law and the due exercise by Molycorp or Callco of
the Retraction Call Right, a holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled
at any time to require the Company to redeem, on the fifth Business Day after
the date on which the Retraction Request is received by the Company (the "
**Retraction Date** "), any or all of the Exchangeable Shares registered in
the name of such holder for an amount per share equal to the Exchangeable
Share Price applicable on the last Business Day prior to the Retraction Date
(the " **Retraction Price** "), which price shall be satisfied in full by the
Company delivering or causing to be delivered to such holder the Exchangeable
Share Consideration representing the Retraction Price. The holder must give
notice of a request to redeem by presenting and surrendering to the Company,
at the registered office of the Company or at any office of the Transfer Agent
as may be specified by the Company by notice to the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares, the certificate or certificates representing the
Exchangeable Shares that the holder desires to have the Company redeem,
together with (A) such other documents and instruments as may be required to
effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the BCBCA and the articles and
by-laws of the Company and such additional documents, instruments and payments
as the Transfer Agent and the Company may reasonably require and (B) a duly
executed request (the  **Retraction Request** ) in the form of Schedule A
hereto or in such other form as may be acceptable to the Company specifying
that the holder desires to have all or any number specified therein of the
Exchangeable Shares represented by such

 



      
 

 



 

certificate or certificates (the " **Retracted Shares** ") redeemed by the
Company.

 



 

(ii) In the case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares pursuant to this
Section 6(a), upon receipt by the Company or the Transfer Agent in the manner
specified in Section 6(a)(i) of a certificate representing the number of
Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to have the Company redeem,
together with a duly executed Retraction Request and such additional documents
and instruments specified in Section 6(a)(i), and provided that (A) the
Retraction Request has not been revoked by the holder of such Exchangeable
Shares in the manner specified in Section 6(a)(iv) and (B) neither Molycorp
nor **** Callco has exercised the Retraction Call Right, the Company shall
redeem the Retracted Shares effective at the close of business on the
Retraction Date. On the Retraction Date, the Company shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to such holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the
securities register of the Company for the Exchangeable Shares or at the
address specified in the Retraction Request or by holding for pick-up by the
holder at the registered office of the Company or at any office of the
Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Company by notice to the holders of
the Exchangeable Shares, the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the
Retraction Price and such delivery of such Exchangeable Share Consideration by
or on behalf of the Company by the Transfer Agent shall be deemed to be
payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the Retraction
Price to the extent that the same is represented by such Exchangeable Share
Consideration, unless any cheque comprising part of such Exchangeable Share
Consideration is not paid on due presentation. If only a part of the
Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate is redeemed, a new
certificate for the balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the
holder at the expense of the Company. On and after the close of business on
the Retraction Date, the holder of the Retracted Shares shall cease to be a
holder of such Retracted Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of
the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other than the right to receive the
total Retraction Price in respect thereof, unless upon presentation and
surrender of certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, payment
of the aggregate Retraction Price payable to such holder shall not be made, in
which case the rights of such holder shall remain unaffected until such
aggregate Retraction Price has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided.
On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, provided that
presentation and surrender of certificates and payment of such aggregate
Retraction Price has been made in accordance with the foregoing provisions,
the holder of the Retracted Shares so redeemed by the Company shall thereafter
be considered and deemed for all purposes to be a holder of the Molycorp
Shares delivered to such holder.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6, the Company shall
not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a
Retraction Request if and to the extent that such redemption of Retracted
Shares would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of
applicable law. If the Company believes that on any Retraction Date it would
not be permitted by any of such provisions to redeem the Retracted Shares
tendered for redemption on such date, and neither Molycorp nor Callco has
exercised the Retraction Call Right with respect to such Retracted Shares, the
Company shall only be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a
holder in a Retraction Request to the extent of the maximum number that may be
so redeemed (rounded down to a whole number of shares) as would not be
contrary to such provisions and shall notify the holder and the Trustee at
least two Business Days prior to the Retraction Date as to the number of
Retracted Shares which will not be redeemed by the Company. In any case in
which the redemption by the Company of Retracted Shares would be contrary to
solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law, the Company shall
redeem Retracted Shares in accordance with Section 6(a)(ii) on a pro rata
basis and shall issue to each holder of Retracted Shares a new certificate, at
the expense of the Company, representing the Retracted Shares not redeemed by
the Company pursuant to Section 6(a)(ii). If the Company would otherwise be
obligated to redeem Retracted Shares pursuant to Section 6(a)(ii) but is not
obligated to do so as a result of solvency requirements or other provisions of
applicable law, the holder of any such Retracted Shares not redeemed by the
Company pursuant to Section 6(a)(ii) as a result of solvency requirements or
other provisions of applicable law shall be deemed, by delivery of the
Retraction Request to have instructed the Transfer Agent to require Molycorp
or Callco to purchase such Retracted Shares from such holder on the Retraction
Date or as soon as practicable thereafter on payment by Molycorp or Callco to
such holder of the total Retraction Price in respect of such Retracted Shares,
all as more specifically provided for in the Voting and Exchange Trust
Agreement.

 



 

(iv) A holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given by the
holder to the Company before the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Retraction Date, withdraw its Retraction Request, in
which event such Retraction Request shall be null and void and, for greater
certainty, the revocable offer constituted by the Retraction Request to sell
the Retracted Shares to Callco shall be deemed to have been revoked.

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6(a), if:

 



 

A. exercise of the rights of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares, or any of
them, to require the Company to redeem any Exchangeable Shares pursuant to
this Section 6(a) on any Retraction Date would

 



      
 

 



 

require listing particulars or any similar document to be issued in order to
obtain the approval of the NYSE to the listing and trading (subject to
official notice of issuance) of the Molycorp Shares that would be required to
be delivered to such holders of Exchangeable Shares in connection with the
exercise of such rights; and

 



 

B. as a result of (A) above, it would not be practicable (notwithstanding the
reasonable endeavours of Molycorp) to obtain such approvals in time to enable
all or any of such Molycorp Shares to be admitted to listing and trading by
the NYSE (subject to official notice of issuance) when so delivered,

 



 

the Retraction Date shall, notwithstanding any other date specified or
otherwise deemed to be specified in any relevant Retraction Request, be deemed
for all purposes to be the earlier of (x) the second Business Day immediately
following the date the approvals referred to in Section 6(a)(v)A are obtained
and (ii) the date which is 30 Business Days after the date on which the
relevant Retraction Request is received by the Company, and references in
these Exchangeable Share Provisions to such Retraction Date shall be construed
accordingly.

 



 

(b) _Retraction Call Rights_

 



 

(i) In the event that a holder of Exchangeable Shares delivers a Retraction
Request pursuant to Section 6(a), and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 6(b)(ii) (including that Callco shall only be entitled to exercise its
Retraction Call Right with respect to those holders of Exchangeable Shares, if
any, in respect of which Molycorp has not exercised its Retraction Call
Right), Molycorp and Callco shall each have the overriding right (the "
**Retraction Call Right** "), notwithstanding the proposed redemption of the
Exchangeable Shares by the Company pursuant to Section 6(a), to purchase from
such holder on the Retraction Date all but not less than all of the Retracted
Shares held by such holder on payment by Molycorp or Callco, as the case may
be, of an amount per share equal to the Exchangeable Share Price applicable on
the last Business Day prior to the Retraction Date (the " **Retraction Call
Right Purchase Price** "), which price shall be satisfied in full by Molycorp
or Callco, as the case may, delivering or causing to be delivered to such
holder the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the Retraction Call
Right Purchase Price. Upon the exercise of the Retraction Call Right in
respect of Retracted Shares, the holder of such shares shall be obligated to
sell all of such Retracted Shares to Molycorp or Callco, as the case may be,
on the Retraction Date on payment by Molycorp or Callco, as the case may be,
of the total Retraction Price in respect of such Retracted Shares as set forth
in this Section 6(b)(i).

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Upon receipt by the Company of a Retraction Request, the Company shall
immediately notify Molycorp and Callco thereof and shall provide Molycorp and
Callco with a copy of the Retraction Request. Callco shall only be entitled to
exercise its Retraction Call Right with respect to those holders of Retracted
Shares, if any, in respect of which Molycorp has not exercised its Retraction
Call Right. In order to exercise its Retraction Call Right, Molycorp or
Callco, as the case may be, must notify the Company in writing of its
determination to do so (a " **Retraction Call Notice** ") within five Business
Days after the Company notifies Molycorp and Callco of the Retraction Request.
If neither Molycorp nor Callco so notifies the Company within such five
Business Day period, the Company shall notify the holder as soon as possible
thereafter that neither Molycorp nor Callco will exercise the Retraction Call
Right. If one or both of Molycorp and Callco delivers a Retraction Call Notice
within such five Business Day period and duly exercises its Retraction Call
Right in accordance with this Section 6(b)(ii), the obligation of the Company
to redeem the Retracted Shares shall terminate and, provided that the
Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder of such Retracted Shares in
the manner specified in Section 6(a)(a)(iv), Molycorp or Callco, as the case
may be, shall purchase from such holder and such holder shall sell to Molycorp
or Callco, as the case may be, on the Retraction Date the Retracted Shares for
an amount per share equal to the Retraction Call Right Purchase Price.
Provided that the aggregate Retraction Call Right Purchase Price has been so
deposited with the Transfer Agent as provided in Section 6(b)(iii), the
closing of the purchase and sale of the Retracted Shares pursuant to the
Retraction Call Right shall be deemed to have occurred as at the close of
business on the Retraction Date and, for greater certainty, no redemption by
the Company of such Retracted Shares shall take place on the Retraction Date.

 



 

(iii) For the purpose of completing a purchase of Retracted Shares pursuant to
the exercise of the Retraction Call Right, Molycorp or Callco, as the case may
be, shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holder of such Retracted
Shares, at the address of the holder recorded in the securities register of
the Company for the Exchangeable Shares or at the address specified in the
holders Retraction Request or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the
registered office of the Company or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may
be specified by the Company by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares,
the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the Retraction Call Right
Purchase Price to which such holder is entitled and such delivery of
Exchangeable Share Consideration on behalf of Molycorp or Callco, as the case
may be, shall be deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all
liability for the Retraction Call Right Purchase Price to the extent that the
same is represented by such Exchangeable Share Consideration, unless such
cheque comprising part of such Exchangeable Share Consideration is not paid on
due presentation.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, the holder of
the Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted Shares and
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect
thereof, other than the right to receive the total Retraction Call Right
Purchase Price in respect thereof, unless upon presentation and surrender of
certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, payment of the
aggregate Retraction Call Right Purchase Price payable to such holder shall
not be made, in which case the rights of such holder shall remain unaffected
until such aggregate Retraction Call Right Purchase Price has been paid in the
manner hereinbefore provided. On and after the close of business on the
Retraction Date, provided that presentation and surrender of certificates and
payment of such aggregate Retraction Call Right Purchase Price has been made
in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the Retracted
Shares so purchased by Molycorp or Callco, as the case may be, shall
thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be a holder of the
Molycorp Shares delivered to such holder.

 



 

 **7.** ** ****Redemption of Exchangeable Shares by the Company**

 



 

(a) _Redemption Amount_. Subject to applicable law and the due exercise by
Molycorp or Callco of the Redemption Call Right, the Company shall on the
Redemption Date redeem all but not less than all of the then outstanding
Exchangeable Shares for an amount per share (the " **Redemption Price** ")
equal to the Exchangeable Share Price on the last Business Day prior to the
Redemption Date, which price shall be satisfied in full by the Company
delivering or causing to be delivered to each holder of Exchangeable Shares
the Exchangeable Share Consideration for each Exchangeable Share held by such
holder.

 



 

(b) _Notice of Redemption_. In the case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares
pursuant to Section 7(a), the Company shall, at least 30 days before the
Redemption Date (other than a Redemption Date established in connection with a
Molycorp Control Transaction, an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt
Exchangeable Share Voting Event), send or cause to be sent to each holder of
Exchangeable Shares a notice in writing of the redemption by the Company or
the purchase by Molycorp or Callco under the Redemption Call Right, as the
case may be, of the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder. In the case of a
Redemption Date established in connection with a Molycorp Control Transaction,
an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt Exchangeable Share Voting
Event, the written notice of the redemption by the Company or the purchase by
Molycorp or Callco, as the case may be, under the Redemption Call Right will
be sent on or before the Redemption Date, on as many days prior written notice
as may be determined by the Board of Directors to be reasonably practicable in
the circumstances. In any such case, such notice shall set out the formula for
determining the Redemption Price or the Redemption Call Purchase Price, as the
case may be, the Redemption Date and, if applicable, particulars of the
Redemption Call Right. In the case of any notice given in connection with a

 



      
 

 



 

possible Redemption Date, such notice will be given contingently and will be
withdrawn if the contingency does not occur.

 



 

(c) _Payment of Redemption Price_. On or after the Redemption Date, and
provided that the Redemption Call Right has not been exercised by Callco, the
Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed the Redemption Price for each such
Exchangeable Share, upon presentation and surrender of the certificates
representing such Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares
under the CBCA and the articles and by-laws of the Company and such additional
documents, instruments and payments as the Transfer Agent and the Company may
reasonably require, at the registered office of the Company or at any office
of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by notice to the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares. Payment of the Redemption Price for such Exchangeable
Shares shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder
recorded in the securities register of the Company for the Exchangeable Shares
or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the
Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Company by notice to the holders of
Exchangeable Shares, the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the
Redemption Price. On and after the Redemption Date, the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares called for redemption shall cease to be holders of such
Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of
holders in respect thereof (including any rights under the Voting and Exchange
Trust Agreement) other than the right to receive their proportionate part of
the total Redemption Price, unless payment of the total Redemption Price for
such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of
certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the
rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the Redemption Price has
been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. The Company shall have the
right at any time after the sending of notice of its intention to redeem the
Exchangeable Shares as aforesaid to deposit or cause to be deposited the total
Redemption Price (in the form of Exchangeable Share Consideration) of the
Exchangeable Shares so called for redemption, or of such of the said
Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have not at the date of
such deposit been surrendered by the holders thereof in connection with such
redemption, in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust company in
Canada named in such notice and any interest earned on such deposit shall
belong to the Company. Provided that such total Redemption Price has been so
deposited prior to the Redemption Date, on and after the Redemption Date, the
Exchangeable Shares shall be redeemed and the rights of the holders thereof
after the Redemption Date shall be limited to receiving their proportionate
part of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares so deposited,
against presentation and surrender of the certificates for the Exchangeable
Shares held by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing
provisions.

 



      
 

 



 

 **8.** ** ****Purchase for Cancellation**

 



 

(a) _Private Agreement_. Subject to applicable law and the articles and by-
laws of the Company, and notwithstanding Section 8(b), the Company may at any
time and from time to time purchase for cancellation all or any part of the
Exchangeable Shares by private agreement with the holder thereof.

 



 

(b) _Tender Offer_. Subject to applicable law and the articles and by-laws of
the Company, the Company may at any time and from time to time purchase for
cancellation all or any part of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares at any
price per share by tender to all the holders of record of Exchangeable Shares
then outstanding or through the facilities of any stock exchange on which the
Exchangeable Shares are listed or quoted together with an amount equal to all
declared and unpaid dividends thereon for which the record date has occurred
prior to the date of purchase. If in response to an invitation for tenders
under the provisions of this Section 8(b), more Exchangeable Shares are
tendered at a price or prices acceptable to the Company than the Company is
prepared to purchase, the Exchangeable Shares to be purchased by the Company
shall be purchased as nearly as may be pro rata according to the number of
shares tendered by each holder who submits a tender to the Company, provided
that when shares are tendered at different prices, the pro rating shall be
effected (disregarding fractions) only with respect to the shares tendered at
the price at which more shares were tendered than the Company is prepared to
purchase after the Company has purchased all the shares tendered at lower
prices. If only part of the Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate
are purchased pursuant to this Section 8(b), a new certificate for the balance
of such shares shall be issued at the expense of the Company.

 



 

 **9.** ** ****Voting Rights**

 



 

Except as required by applicable law and by Section 11, the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares shall not be entitled as such to receive notice of or to
attend any meeting of the shareholders of the Company or to vote at any such
meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares shall not have class votes except as required by
applicable law.

 



 

 **10.** ** ****Specified Amount**

 



 

The amount specified in respect of each Exchangeable Share for the purposes of
subsection 191(4) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) shall be an amount equal to
$[*].

 



      
 

 



 

 **11.** ** ****Amendment and Approval**

 



 

(a) _Amendment_. The rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching
to the Exchangeable Shares may be added to, changed or removed only with the
approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given as hereinafter
specified.

 



 

(b) _Approval_. Any approval given by the holders of the Exchangeable Shares
to add to, change or remove any right, privilege, restriction or condition
attaching to the Exchangeable Shares or any other matter requiring the
approval or consent of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares in accordance
with applicable law shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given if it
shall have been given in accordance with applicable law, subject to a minimum
requirement that such approval be evidenced by resolution passed by not less
than two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution at a meeting of holders
of Exchangeable Shares duly called and held at which the holders of at least
10% of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares at that time are present or
represented by proxy; provided, however, that if at any such meeting the
holders of at least 10% of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares at that time
are not present or represented by proxy within one-half hour after the time
appointed for such meeting, then the meeting shall be adjourned to such date
not less than five days thereafter and to such time and place as may be
designated by the Chairman of such meeting. At such adjourned meeting the
holders of Exchangeable Shares present or represented by proxy thereat may
transact the business for which the meeting was originally called and a
resolution passed thereat by the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds
of the votes cast on such resolution at such meeting shall constitute the
approval or consent of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares.

 



 

 **12.** ** ****Reciprocal Changes, etc. in Respect of Molycorp Shares**

 



 

(a) Each holder of an Exchangeable Share acknowledges that the Support
Agreement provides, in part, that Molycorp will not, except as provided in the
Support Agreement, without the prior approval of the Company and the prior
approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with
Section 11(b):

 



 

(i) issue or distribute Molycorp Shares (or securities exchangeable for or
convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Molycorp Shares) to the holders
of all or substantially all of the then outstanding Molycorp Shares by way of
stock dividend or other distribution, other than an issue of Molycorp Shares
(or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to
acquire Molycorp Shares) to holders of Molycorp Shares (i) who exercise an
option to receive dividends in Molycorp Shares (or securities exchangeable for
or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Molycorp Shares) in lieu of
receiving cash dividends or (ii) pursuant to any dividend reinvestment plan or
similar arrangement;

 



 

(ii) issue or distribute rights, options or warrants to the holders of all or
substantially all of the then outstanding Molycorp Shares entitling them to

 



      
 

 



 

subscribe for or to purchase Molycorp Shares (or securities exchangeable for
or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Molycorp Shares); or

 



 

(iii) issue or distribute to the holders of all or substantially all of the
then outstanding Molycorp Shares:

 



 

A. shares or securities of Molycorp of any class other than Molycorp Shares
(or securities convertible into or exchangeable for or carrying rights to
acquire Molycorp Shares);

 



 

B. rights, options or warrants other than those referred to in Section
12(a)(ii) above;

 



 

C. evidence of indebtedness of Molycorp; or

 



 

D. assets of Molycorp,

 



 

unless (A) the Company is permitted under applicable law to issue or
distribute the economic equivalent on a per share basis of such rights,
options, warrants, securities, shares, evidences of indebtedness or other
assets to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares and (B) the Company shall
issue or distribute the economic equivalent of such rights, options, warrants,
securities, shares evidences of indebtedness or other assets simultaneously to
holders of the Exchangeable Shares; provided, however, that, for greater
certainty, the above restrictions shall not apply to any securities issued or
distributed by Molycorp in order to give effect to and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and in accordance with, the Arrangement
Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each holder of an Exchangeable Share acknowledges that the Support
Agreement further provides, in part, that for so long as any Exchangeable
Shares not owned by Molycorp or its affiliates are outstanding, Molycorp will
not without the prior approval of the Company and the prior approval of the
holders of the Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with Section 11(b):

 



 

(i) subdivide, redivide or change the then outstanding Molycorp Shares into a
greater number of Molycorp Shares;

 



 

(ii) reduce, combine, consolidate or change the then outstanding Molycorp
Shares into a lesser number of Molycorp Shares; or

 



 

(iii) reclassify or otherwise change the Molycorp Shares or effect an
amalgamation, merger, reorganization or other transaction affecting the
Molycorp Shares,

 



 

unless (A) the company is permitted under applicable law to make the same or
an economically equivalent change to, or in the rights of holders of, the
Exchangeable Shares and (B) the same or an economically equivalent change is
made simultaneously to, or in the rights of the holders of, the Exchangeable

 



      
 

 



 

Shares; provided, however, that, for greater certainty, the above restrictions
shall not apply to any securities issued or distributed by Molycorp in order
to give effect to and to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and in
accordance with the Arrangement Agreement. The Support Agreement further
provides, in part, that the aforesaid provisions of the Support Agreement
shall not be changed without the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares given in accordance with Section 11(a).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12, in the event
of an Molycorp Control Transaction:

 



 

(i) in which Molycorp merges or amalgamates with, or in which all or
substantially all of the then outstanding Molycorp Shares are acquired by one
or more other corporations to which Molycorp is, immediately before such
merger, amalgamation or acquisition, related within the meaning of the _Income
Tax Act_ (Canada) (otherwise than virtue of a right referred to in paragraph
251(5)(b) thereof);

 



 

(ii) which does not result in an acceleration of the Redemption Date in
accordance with paragraph (b) of the definition of such term in Section 1(a);
and

 



 

(iii) in which all or substantially all of the then outstanding Molycorp
Shares are converted into or exchanged for shares or rights to receive such
shares (the " **Other Shares** ") of another corporation (the " **Other
Corporation** ") that, immediately after such Molycorp Control Transaction,
owns or controls, directly or indirectly, Molycorp;

 



 

then all references herein to "Molycorp" shall thereafter be and be deemed to
be references to "Other Corporation" and all references herein to "Molycorp
Shares" shall thereafter be and be deemed to be references to "Other Shares"
(with appropriate adjustments, if any, as are required to result in a holder
of Exchangeable Shares on the exchange, redemption or retraction of shares
pursuant to these Exchangeable Share Provisions or the exchange of shares
pursuant to the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement immediately subsequent to
the Molycorp Control Transaction being entitled to receive that number of
Other Shares equal to the number of Other Shares such holder of Exchangeable
Shares would have received if the exchange, option or retraction of such
shares pursuant to these Exchangeable Share Provisions or the exchange of such
shares pursuant to the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement had occurred
immediately prior to the Molycorp Control Transaction and the Molycorp Control
Transaction was completed) but subject to subsequent adjustments to reflect
any subsequent changes in the share capital of the issuer of the Other Shares,
including without limitation, any subdivision, consolidation or reduction of
share capital, without any need to amend the terms and conditions of the
Exchangeable Shares and without any further action required.

the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with Section 11(b)
other than such amendments, waivers and/or forgiveness as may be necessary or
advisable for the purposes of:

 



 

(i) adding to the covenants of any or all of the other parties to the Support
Agreement if the board of directors of each of Molycorp, Callco and the
Company shall be of the good faith opinion that such additions will not be
prejudicial in any material respect to the rights or interests of the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares as a whole;

 



 

(ii) evidencing the succession of successors to Molycorp either by operation
of law or agreement to the liabilities and covenants of Molycorp under the
Support Agreement (" **Molycorp Successors** ") and the covenants of and
obligations assumed by each such Molycorp Successor in accordance with the
provisions of Article 3 of the Support Agreement;

 



 

(iii) making such amendments or modifications not inconsistent with the
Support Agreement as may be necessary or desirable with respect to matters or
questions arising thereunder which, in the good faith opinion of the board of
directors of each of Molycorp, Callco and the Company, having in mind the
interests of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares as a whole, it may be
expedient to make, provided that each such board of directors shall be of the
good faith opinion, after consultation with counsel, that such amendments and
modifications will not be prejudicial in any material respect to the rights or
interests of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares as a whole; or

the advice of counsel to Molycorp, Callco and the Company, are required for
the purpose of curing or correcting any ambiguity or defect or inconsistent
provision or clerical omission or mistake or manifest error contained therein,
provided that the board of directors of each of

 



      
 

 



 

Molycorp, Callco and the Company shall be of the good faith opinion that such
changes or corrections will not be prejudicial in any material respect to the
rights or interests of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares as a whole.

 



 

 **14.** ** ****Legend; Call Rights; Withholding Rights**

 



 

(a) _Legend_. The certificates evidencing the Exchangeable Shares shall
contain or have affixed thereto a legend in form and on terms approved by the
Board of Directors, with respect to the Support Agreement, the provisions of
the Plan of Arrangement relating to the Liquidation Call Right, the Redemption
Call Right and the Change of Law Call Right, the Voting and Exchange Trust
Agreement (including the provisions with respect to the voting rights and
automatic exchange thereunder) and the Retraction Call Right.

 



 

(b) _Call Rights_. Each holder of an Exchangeable Share, whether of record or
beneficial, by virtue of becoming and being such a holder shall be deemed to
acknowledge each of the Liquidation Call Right, the Redemption Call Right, the
Change of Law Call Right and the Retraction Call Right, in each case, in
favour of Molycorp and Callco, and the overriding nature thereof in connection
with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company or any other
distribution of the assets of the Company among its shareholders for the
purpose of winding up its affairs, or the retraction or redemption of
Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be, and to be bound thereby in favour of
Molycorp and Callco as provided herein and in the Plan of Arrangement.

 



 

(c) _Withholding Rights_. Molycorp, Callco, the Company and the Transfer Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend, distribution or
other consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Exchangeable Shares
such amounts as Molycorp, Callco, the Company or the Transfer Agent, as the
case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment
under the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) or United States tax laws or any provision
of provincial, territorial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case, as
amended. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the holder of
the Exchangeable Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the
appropriate taxing agency. To the extent that the amount so required to be
deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of
the consideration otherwise payable to the holder, Molycorp, Callco, the
Company and the Transfer Agent are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise
dispose of such portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide
sufficient funds to Molycorp, Callco, the Company or the Transfer Agent, as
the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding
requirement and Molycorp, Callco, the Company or the Transfer Agent, as the
case may be, shall notify the holder thereof and remit any unapplied balance
of the net proceeds of such sale.

 



      
 

 



 

 **15.** ** ****Notices**

 



 

(a) _Notices_. Subject to applicable law, any notice, request or other
communication to be given to the Company by a holder of Exchangeable Shares
shall be in writing and shall be valid and effective if given by first class
mail (postage prepaid) or by telecopy or by delivery to the registered office
of the Company and addressed to the attention of the Secretary of the Company.
Any such notice, request or other communication, if given by mail, telecopy or
delivery, shall only be deemed to have been given and received upon actual
receipt thereof by the Company.

be. Any such presentation and surrender of certificates made by first class
mail (postage prepaid) shall be at the sole risk of the holder mailing the
same.

 



 

(c) _Notice to Shareholders_.

 



 

(i) Subject to applicable law, any notice, request or other communication to
be given to a holder of Exchangeable Shares by or on behalf of the Company
shall be in writing and shall be valid and effective if given by first class
mail (postage prepaid) or by delivery to the address of the holder recorded in
the register of shareholders of the Company or, in the event of the address of
any such holder not being so recorded, then at the last known address of such
holder. Any such notice, request or other communication, if given by mail,
shall be deemed to have been given and received on the third Business Day
following the date of mailing and, if given by delivery, shall be deemed to
have been given and received on the date of delivery. Accidental failure or

affect any action or proceeding to be taken by the Company pursuant thereto.

 



 

(ii) In the event of any interruption of mail service immediately prior to a
scheduled mailing or in the period following a mailing during which delivery
normally would be expected to occur, the Company shall make reasonable efforts
to disseminate any notice by other means, such as publication. Except as
otherwise required or permitted by law, if post offices in Canada are not open
for the deposit of mail, any notice which the Company or the Transfer Agent
may give or cause to be given

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder will be deemed to have been properly given and to have been received
by holders of Exchangeable Shares if (i) it is given to the Toronto Stock
Exchange for dissemination or (ii) it is published once in the national
edition of _The Globe and Mail_ and in the daily newspapers of general
circulation in each of the French and English languages in the City of
Montreal, provided that if the national edition of _The Globe and Mail_ is not
being generally circulated, publication thereof will be made in the _National
Post_ or any other daily newspaper of general circulation published in the
City of Toronto.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Exchangeable Share
Provisions, notices, other communications and deliveries need not be mailed if

entitled to any deliveries (including certificates and cheques) which are not
mailed for the foregoing reason may take delivery thereof at the office of the
Transfer Agent to which the deliveries were made, upon application to the
Transfer Agent, until such time as the Company has determined that delivery by
mail will not longer be delayed. the Company will provide notice of any such
determination not to mail made hereunder as soon as reasonably practicable
after the making of such determination and in accordance with this Section
15(c). Such deliveries in such circumstances will constitute delivery to the
persons entitled thereto.

The Company shall be entitled to require any holder of an Exchangeable Share
or any person whom the Company knows or has reasonable cause to believe holds
any interest whatsoever in an Exchangeable Share to (a) confirm that fact or
(b) give such details as to whom has an interest in such Exchangeable Share,
in each case as would be required (if the Exchangeable Shares were a class of
"equity shares" of the Company) under Section 102.1 of the Securities Act or
as would be required under the articles or by-laws of Molycorp or any laws or
regulations, or pursuant to the rules or regulations of any regulatory agency,
if and only to the extent that the Exchangeable Shares were Molycorp Shares.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SCHEDULE A 
TO APPENDIX I**

 



 

 **RETRACTION REQUEST 
[TO BE PRINTED ON EXCHANGEABLE SHARE CERTIFICATES]**

 



 

To: Molycorp, Inc. (" **Molycorp** "), 0934632 B.C. Ltd. (" **Callco** ") and
0934634 B.C. Ltd. (the " **Company** ")

 



 

This notice is given pursuant to Section 6 of the share provisions (the "
**Exchangeable** **Share Provisions** ") attaching to the Exchangeable Shares
of the Company represented by this certificate and all capitalized words and
expressions used in this notice that are defined in the Exchangeable Share
Provisions have the meanings ascribed to such words and expressions in such
Exchangeable Share Provisions.

 



 

The undersigned hereby notifies the Company that, subject to the Retraction
Call Right referred to below, the undersigned desires to have the Company
redeem in accordance with Section 6 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions:

 



 

o all share(s) represented by this certificate; or

 



 

o share(s) only represented by this certificate.

 



 

The undersigned acknowledges the overriding Retraction Call Right of Molycorp
and Callco to purchase all but not less than all the Retracted Shares from the
undersigned and that this notice is and shall be deemed to be a revocable
offer by the undersigned to sell the Retracted Shares to Molycorp or Callco in
accordance with the Retraction Call Right on the Retraction Date for the
Retraction Call Purchase Price and on the other terms and conditions set out
in Section 6(b) of the Exchangeable Share Provisions. If neither Molycorp nor
Callco exercised the Retraction Call Right, the Company will notify the
undersigned of such fact as soon as possible. This Retraction Request, and
this offer to sell the Retracted Shares to Molycorp or Callco, may be revoked
and withdrawn by the undersigned only by notice in writing given to the
Company at any time before the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Retraction Date.

 



 

The undersigned acknowledges that if, as a result of solvency provisions of
applicable law, the Company is unable to redeem all Retracted Shares, and
provided that neither Molycorp nor Callco has exercised the Retraction Call
Right with respect to the Retracted Shares, the Retracted Shares will be
automatically exchanged pursuant to the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement so
as to require Molycorp to purchase the unredeemed Retracted Shares.

 



 

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants to Molycorp, Callco and the
Company that the undersigned:

 



 

o is

 



 

(select one)

 



 

o is not

 



 

a resident of Canada for purposes of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada). The
undersigned acknowledges that in the absence of an indication that the
undersigned is not a resident of Canada, withholding on account of

 



      
 

 



 

Canadian tax may be made from amounts payable to the undersigned on the
redemption or purchase of the Retracted Shares.

money or other assets or authorized but unissued securities available to
enable the due declaration and the due and punctual payment, in accordance

such a dividend, on the Molycorp Shares, Exchangeco shall (A) effect a
corresponding, contemporaneous and economically equivalent subdivision of the

Provisions) (an " **Equivalent Stock Subdivision** ") and (B) have sufficient
authorized but unissued securities available to enable the Equivalent Stock

(b) advise Exchangeco sufficiently in advance of the declaration by Molycorp
of any dividend or other distribution on the Molycorp Shares and take all such
other

 



      
 

 



 

actions as are reasonably necessary or desirable, in co-operation with

(i) the respective declaration date, record date and payment date for an
Equivalent Dividend shall be the same as the declaration date, record date and
payment date for the corresponding dividend or other distribution on the
Molycorp Shares; or

 



 

(ii) the record date and effective date for an Equivalent Stock Subdivision
shall be the same as the record date and payment date for the corresponding
stock dividend or distribution of stock, in lieu of such a dividend, on the
Molycorp Shares and that such Equivalent Stock Subdivision shall comply with
the requirements of the stock exchange on which the Exchangeable Shares are
then listed;

 



 

(c) ensure that the record date for determining shareholders entitled to
receive any dividend or other distribution declared on the Molycorp Shares is
not less than ten Business Days after the declaration date of such dividend or
other distribution or such shorter period as may be permitted under applicable
law and the requirements of any stock exchange on which the Exchangeable
Shares are then listed;

 



 

(d) take all such actions and do all such things as are reasonably necessary
or desirable to enable and permit Exchangeco, in accordance with applicable

exercise by it of the Liquidation Call Right, the Retraction Call Right, the
Change of Law Call Right (as defined in the Plan of Arrangement) or the
Redemption Call Right, including all such actions and all such things as are
necessary or desirable to enable and permit Molycorp or Callco, as the case
may be, to deliver or cause to be delivered Molycorp Shares or other property
to the holders of Exchangeable Shares in accordance with the provisions of the
Liquidation Call Right, the Retraction Call Right, the Change of Law Call
Right or the Redemption Call Right, as the case may be; and

voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Exchangeco or any other
distribution of the assets of Exchangeco among its shareholders for the
purpose of winding up its affairs, nor take any action or omit to take any

up of Exchangeco or any other distribution of the assets of Exchangeco among
its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs.

 



 

 **2.2** ** ****Segregation of Funds**

separate account of Exchangeco and segregate a sufficient amount of such other
assets and property as is necessary to enable Exchangeco to pay dividends when
due and to pay or otherwise satisfy its respective obligations with respect to

 **2.6** ** ****Qualification of Molycorp Shares**

 



 

(a) Molycorp covenants that it will use its reasonable best efforts to make

dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco, or any retraction, redemption or any
other exchange, direct or indirect, of Exchangeable Shares, if such issuance

 **2.7** ** ****Economic Equivalence**

convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Molycorp Shares) to the holders
of all or substantially all of the then outstanding Molycorp Shares by way of
stock dividend or other distribution, other than an issue of Molycorp Shares
(or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to

(iii) issue or distribute to the holders of all or substantially all of the
then outstanding Molycorp Shares (A) shares or securities of Molycorp of any

exchangeable for or carrying rights to acquire Molycorp Shares), (B) rights,
options, warrants or other assets other than those referred to in Section
2.7(a)(ii), (C) evidence of indebtedness of Molycorp or (D) assets of
Molycorp,

 



 

unless, in each case, (x) Exchangeco is permitted under applicable law to
issue or distribute the economic equivalent on a per share basis of such
rights, options, warrants, securities, shares, evidences of indebtedness or
other assets to holders of the Exchangeable Shares and (y) Exchangeco shall
issue or distribute the economic equivalent of such rights, options, warrants,
securities, shares, evidences of indebtedness or other assets simultaneously
to holders of the Exchangeable Shares, provided that, for greater certainty,

by Molycorp in order to give effect to and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and in accordance with, the Arrangement Agreement.

 



 

(b) Molycorp shall not without the prior approval of Exchangeco and the prior
approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with
Section 11(b) of the Exchangeable Share Provisions:

 



 

(i) subdivide, redivide or change the then outstanding Molycorp Shares into a
greater number of Molycorp Shares; or

 



 

(ii) reduce, combine, consolidate or change the then outstanding Molycorp
Shares into a lesser number of Molycorp Shares; or

 



 

(iii) reclassify or otherwise change Molycorp Shares or effect an

affecting Molycorp Shares;

 



 

unless, in each case, (x) Exchangeco is permitted under applicable law to make
the same or an economically equivalent change to, or in the rights of holders
of, the Exchangeable Shares, and (y) the same or an economically equivalent
change is made simultaneously to, or in the rights of the holders of, the
Exchangeable Shares, provided that, for greater certainty, the above
restrictions shall not apply to any securities issued or distributed by
Molycorp in order to give effect to and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and in accordance with, the Arrangement Agreement.

 



 

(c) Molycorp shall ensure that the record date for any event referred to in
Section 2.7(a) or Section 2.7(b) or, if no record date is applicable for such
event, the effective date for any such event, is not less than ten Business
Days after the date on which such event is declared or announced by Molycorp
(with contemporaneous notification thereof by Molycorp to Exchangeco).

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The board of directors of Exchangeco shall determine, in good faith and in
its sole discretion (with the assistance of such financial or other advisors
as the board of may determine), "economic equivalence" for the purposes of any
event referred to in Section 2.7(a) or Section 2.7(b) and each such
determination shall be conclusive and binding on Molycorp. In making each such
determination, the following factors shall, without excluding other factors
determined by the board of directors of Exchangeco to be relevant, be
considered by the board of directors of Exchangeco:

 



 

(i) in the case of any stock dividend or other distribution payable in
Molycorp Shares, the number of such shares issued in proportion to the number
of Molycorp Shares previously outstanding;

 



 

(ii) in the case of the issuance or distribution of any rights, options or
warrants to subscribe for or purchase Molycorp Shares (or securities
exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Molycorp
Shares), the relationship between the exercise price of each such right,
option or warrant, the Current Market Price of a Molycorp Share, the
volatility of the Molycorp Shares and the terms of any such instrument;

 



 

(iii) in the case of the issuance or distribution of any other form of
property (including any shares or securities of Molycorp of any class other
than Molycorp Shares, any rights, options or warrants other than those
referred to in Section 2.7(d)(ii), any evidences of indebtedness of Molycorp
or any assets of Molycorp), the relationship between the fair market value (as
determined by the board of directors of Exchangeco in the manner above
contemplated) of such property to be issued or distributed with respect to
each outstanding Molycorp Share and the Current Market Price of a Molycorp
Share;

 



 

(iv) in the case of any subdivision, redivision or change of the then
outstanding Molycorp Shares into a greater number of Molycorp Shares or the
reduction, combination, consolidation or change of the then outstanding
Molycorp Shares into a lesser number of Molycorp Shares or any amalgamation,
merger, arrangement, reorganization or other transaction affecting Molycorp
Shares, the effect thereof upon the then outstanding Molycorp Shares; and

 



 

(v) in all such cases, the general taxation consequences of the relevant event
to holders of Exchangeable Shares to the extent that such consequences may
differ from the taxation consequences to holders of Molycorp Shares as a
result of differences between taxation laws of Canada and the United States
(except for any differing consequences arising as a result of differing
withholding taxes and marginal taxation rates and without regard to the
individual circumstances of holders of Exchangeable Shares).

 



       
 

 



 

(e) Exchangeco agrees that, to the extent required, upon due notice from
Molycorp, Exchangeco shall use its best efforts to take or cause to be taken
such steps as may be necessary for the purposes of ensuring that appropriate
dividends are paid or other distributions are made by Exchangeco, or
subdivisions, redivisions or changes are made to the Exchangeable Shares, in
order to implement the required economic equivalence with respect to the
Molycorp Shares and Exchangeable Shares as provided for in this Section 2.7.

 



 

 **2.8** ** ****Tender Offers**

 



 

In the event that a tender offer, share exchange offer, issuer bid, take-over
bid or similar transaction with respect to Molycorp Shares (an " **Offer** ")
is proposed by Molycorp or is proposed to Molycorp or its shareholders and is
recommended by the board of directors of Molycorp, or is otherwise effected or
to be effected with the consent or approval of the board of directors of
Molycorp, and the Exchangeable Shares are not redeemed by Exchangeco or
purchased by Molycorp or Callco pursuant to the Redemption Call Right,
Molycorp and Exchangeco will use reasonable best efforts to take all such
actions and do all such things as are necessary or desirable to enable and
permit holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than Molycorp and its affiliates)
to participate in such Offer to the same extent and on an economically
equivalent basis as the holders of Molycorp Shares, without discrimination.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Molycorp and Exchangeco will
use reasonable best efforts expeditiously and in good faith to ensure that
holders of Exchangeable Shares may participate in each such Offer without
being required to retract Exchangeable Shares as against Exchangeco (or, if so
required, to ensure that any such retraction shall be effective only upon, and
shall be conditional upon, the closing of such Offer and only to the extent
necessary to tender or deposit to the Offer). Nothing herein shall affect the
rights of Exchangeco to redeem, or Molycorp or Callco to purchase pursuant to
the Redemption Call Right, Exchangeable Shares in the event of a Molycorp
Control Transaction.

 



 

 **2.9** ** ****Molycorp and Affiliates Not to Vote Exchangeable Shares**

 



 

Each of Molycorp and Callco covenants and agrees that it shall appoint and
cause to be appointed proxyholders with respect to all Exchangeable Shares
held by it and its affiliates for the sole purpose of attending each meeting
of holders of Exchangeable Shares in order to be counted as part of the quorum
for each such meeting. Each of Molycorp and Callco further covenants and
agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, exercise any
voting rights which may be exercisable by holders of Exchangeable Shares from
time to time pursuant to the Exchangeable Share Provisions or pursuant to the
provisions of the _Business Corporations Act_ (British Columbia) (or any
successor or other corporate statute by which Exchangeco may in the future be
governed) with respect to any Exchangeable Shares held by it or by its
affiliates in respect of any matter considered at any meeting of holders of
Exchangeable Shares, provided however, for further clarity, that this Section
2.9 shall not in any way restrict Callcos right to vote its common shares of
Exchangeco in accordance with the Exchangeable Share Provisions.

 



      
 

 



 

 **2.10** ** ****Ordinary Market Purchases**

 



 

For certainty, nothing contained in this Agreement, including the obligations
of Molycorp contained in Section 2.8, shall limit the ability of Molycorp (or
any of its affiliates) to make ordinary market purchases of Molycorp Shares in
accordance with applicable laws and regulatory or stock exchange requirements.

 



 

 **2.11** ** ****Ownership of Outstanding Shares**

 



 

Without the prior approval of Exchangeco and the prior approval of the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with Section 11(b) of the
Exchangeable Share Provisions, Molycorp covenants and agrees in favour of
Exchangeco that, as long as any outstanding Exchangeable Shares not owned by
Molycorp or its affiliates are outstanding, Molycorp will be and remain the
direct or indirect beneficial owner of all issued and outstanding common
shares in the capital of Exchangeco and Callco. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Molycorp shall not be in violation of this Section 2.11 if any person or group
of persons acting jointly or in concert acquires all or substantially all of
the assets of Molycorp or the Molycorp Shares pursuant to any merger of
Molycorp pursuant to which Molycorp was not the surviving corporation.

 



 

 **2.12** ** ****Stock Exchange Listing**

 



 

Molycorp covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco that, as long as any
outstanding Exchangeable Shares are owned by any person other than Molycorp or
any of its affiliates, Molycorp shall use reasonable efforts to maintain a
listing for such Exchangeable Shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3 
MOLYCORP SUCCESSORS**

 



 

 **3.1** ** ****Certain Requirements in Respect of Combination, etc.**

 



 

So long as any Exchangeable Shares not owned by Molycorp or its affiliates are
outstanding, Molycorp shall not enter into any transaction (whether by way of
reconstruction, reorganization, consolidation, arrangement, amalgamation,
merger, transfer, sale, lease or otherwise) whereby all or substantially all

or more other corporations to which Molycorp is, immediately before such
merger, amalgamation or acquisition, "related" within the meaning of the
_Income Tax Act_ (Canada) (otherwise than by virtue of a right referred to in

immediately after such Molycorp Control Transaction, owns or controls,
directly or indirectly, Molycorp;

 



 

then all references herein to "Molycorp" shall thereafter be and be deemed to
be references to "Other Corporation" and all references herein to "Molycorp
Shares" shall thereafter be and be deemed to be references to "Other Shares"
(with appropriate adjustments if any, as are required to result in a holder of
Exchangeable Shares on the exchange, redemption or retraction of such shares
pursuant to the Exchangeable Share Provisions or Article 5 of the Plan of
Arrangement or exchange of such shares pursuant to the Voting and Exchange
Trust Agreement immediately subsequent to the Molycorp Control Transaction
being entitled to receive that number of Other Shares equal to the number of
Other Shares such holder of Exchangeable Shares would have received if the

Share Provisions or Article 5 of the Plan of Arrangement, or exchange of such
shares pursuant to the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement had occurred

 **ARTICLE 4 
GENERAL**

 



 

 **4.1** ** ****Term**

Subject to Section 4.2, Section 4.3 and Section 4.5 this Agreement may not be

(b) evidencing the succession of Molycorp Successors and the covenants of and
obligations assumed by each such Molycorp Successor in accordance with the

modifications will not be prejudicial in any material respect to the rights or
interests of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares as a whole; or

hereby appoints the Trustee as trustee of the Trust. The Trustee shall hold
the Special Voting Share in order to enable the Trustee to exercise the Voting

and benefit of, the Beneficiaries and in accordance with the provisions of

by each such Beneficiary.

 



 

 **3.3** ** ****Safe Keeping of Certificate**

 



 

The certificate representing the Special Voting Share shall at all times be

Agreement. Subject to Section 6.15:

Meeting or Molycorp Consent who are entitled to instruct the Trustee as to the
voting thereof; and

 



 

(b) to the extent that no instructions are received from a Beneficiary with
respect to the Voting Rights in respect of which such Beneficiary is entitled
to instruct the Trustee, the Trustee shall not exercise or permit the exercise
of such Voting Rights.

 



 

 **4.2** ** ****Number of Votes**

 



 

With respect to all meetings of shareholders of Molycorp at which holders of
Molycorp Shares are entitled to vote (each, a " **Molycorp Meeting** ") and
with respect to all written consents sought from holders of Molycorp Shares
(each, a " **Molycorp Consent** "), each Beneficiary shall be entitled to

record by such Beneficiary at the close of business on the record date
established by Molycorp or by applicable law for such Molycorp Meeting or
Molycorp Consent, as the case may be (collectively, the " **Beneficiary
Votes** "), in respect of each matter, question, proposal or proposition to be
voted on at such Molycorp Meeting or consented to in connection with such
Molycorp Consent.

 



 

 **4.3** ** ****Mailings to Shareholders**

 



 

(a) With respect to each Molycorp Meeting or Molycorp Consent, the Trustee
will mail or cause to be mailed (or otherwise communicate in the same manner
as Molycorp utilizes in communications to holders of Molycorp Shares, subject
to applicable regulatory requirements and to the Trustee being advised in
writing of such manner and provided that such manner of communications is
reasonably available to the Trustee) to each Beneficiary named in the
applicable List on the same day as the mailing (or other communication) with
respect thereto is commenced by Molycorp to its shareholders:

 



 

(i) a copy of such mailing, together with any related materials, including any
proxy or information statement or listing particulars, to be provided to
shareholders of Molycorp;

 



 

(ii) a statement that such Beneficiary is entitled to instruct the Trustee as
to the exercise of the Beneficiary Votes with respect to such Molycorp Meeting
or Molycorp Consent or, pursuant to Section 4.7, to attend such Molycorp
Meeting and to exercise personally the Beneficiary Votes thereat;

 



 

(iii) a statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given to
the Trustee, including an express indication that instructions may be given to
the Trustee to give (A) a proxy to such Beneficiary or his, her or its
designee to exercise personally such holders Beneficiary Votes or (B) a proxy
to a designated agent or other representative of Molycorp to exercise such
holders Beneficiary Votes;

 



 

(iv) a statement that if no such instructions are received from such
Beneficiary, the Beneficiary Votes to which the Beneficiary is entitled will
not be exercised;

 



 

(v) a form of direction such Beneficiary may use to direct and instruct the
Trustee as contemplated herein; and

 



 

(vi) a statement of (A) the time and date by which such instructions must be
received by the Trustee in order for such instructions to be binding upon the
Trustee, which in the case of a Molycorp Meeting shall not be earlier than the
close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the date by which
Molycorp has required proxies to be deposited for such

 



      
 

 



 

meeting, and (B) of the method for revoking or amending such instructions.

 



 

(b) The materials referred to in this Section 4.3 shall be provided to the
Trustee by Molycorp, and the materials referred to in Sections 4.3(a)(ii),
4.3(a)(iii), 4.3(a)(iv), 4.3(a)(v) and 4.3(a)(vi) shall (if reasonably
practicable to do so) be subject to reasonable comment by the Trustee in a
timely manner. Subject to the foregoing, Molycorp shall ensure that the
materials to be provided to the Trustee are provided in sufficient time to
permit the Trustee to comment as aforesaid and to send all materials to each
Beneficiary at the same time as such materials are first sent to holders of
Molycorp Shares. Molycorp agrees not to communicate with holders of Molycorp
Shares with respect to the materials referred to in this Section 4.3 otherwise
than by mail unless such method of communication is also reasonably available
to the Trustee for communication with the Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Molycorp may, at its option, exercise the duties of the Trustee to
deliver copies of all materials to all Beneficiaries as required by this
Section 4.3 so long as, in each case, Molycorp delivers a certificate to the
Trustee stating that Molycorp has undertaken to perform the obligations of the
Trustee set forth in this Section 4.3.

 



 

(c) For the purpose of determining the number of Beneficiary Votes to which a
Beneficiary is entitled in respect of any Molycorp Meeting or Molycorp
Consent, the number of Exchangeable Shares owned of record by the Beneficiary
shall be determined at the close of business on the record date established by
Molycorp or by applicable law for purposes of determining shareholders
entitled to vote at such Molycorp Meeting or in respect of such Molycorp
Consent. Molycorp shall notify the Trustee of any decision of the board of
directors of Molycorp with respect to the calling of any Molycorp Meeting or
any Molycorp Consent and shall provide all necessary information and materials
to the Trustee in each case promptly and, in any event, in sufficient time to
enable the Trustee to perform the obligations of the Trustee set forth in this
Section 4.3.

 



 

 **4.4** ** ****Copies of Shareholder Information**

 



 

Molycorp shall deliver to the Trustee copies of all proxy materials (including
notices of Molycorp Meetings but excluding proxies to vote Molycorp Shares),
information statements, reports (including all interim and annual financial
statements) and other written communications that, in each case, are to be
distributed by Molycorp from time to time to holders of Molycorp Shares in
sufficient quantities and in sufficient time so as to enable the Trustee to
send or cause to send those materials to each Beneficiary at the same time as
such materials are first sent to holders of Molycorp Shares. The Trustee shall
mail or otherwise send to each Beneficiary, at the expense of Molycorp, copies
of all such materials (and all materials specifically directed to the
Beneficiaries or to the Trustee for the benefit of the Beneficiaries by
Molycorp) received by the Trustee from Molycorp contemporaneously with the
sending of such materials to holders of Molycorp Shares. The Trustee shall
also make available for inspection by any Beneficiary at the Trustees
principal office in Toronto, Ontario all proxy materials, information
statements, reports and other written communications that are:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) received by the Trustee as the registered holder of the Special Voting
Share and made available by Molycorp generally to the holders of Molycorp
Shares; or

 



 

(b) specifically directed to the Beneficiaries or to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Beneficiaries by Molycorp.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Molycorp may, at its option, exercise the
duties of the Trustee to deliver copies of all such materials to all
Beneficiaries as required by this Section 4.4 so long as, in each case,
Molycorp delivers a certificate to the Trustee stating that Molycorp has
undertaken to perform the obligations of the Trustee set forth in this Section
4.4.

 



 

 **4.5** ** ****Other Materials**

 



 

As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by Molycorp or shareholders of
Molycorp (if such receipt is known by Molycorp) of any material sent or given
by or on behalf of a third party to holders of Molycorp Shares generally,
including dissident proxy and information circulars (and related information
and material) and take-over bid and securities exchange take-over bid
circulars (and related information and material), provided such material has
not been sent to the Beneficiaries by or on behalf of such third party,
Molycorp shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to the Trustee
copies thereof in sufficient quantities so as to enable the Trustee to forward
such material (unless the same has been provided directly to Beneficiaries by
such third party) to each Beneficiary as soon as possible thereafter. As soon
as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof, the Trustee shall mail or
otherwise send to each Beneficiary, at the expense of Molycorp, copies of all
such materials received by the Trustee from Molycorp. The Trustee shall also
make available for inspection by any Beneficiary at the Trustees principal
office in Toronto, Ontario copies of all such materials. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Molycorp may, at its option, exercise the duties of the Trustee to
deliver copies of all such materials to all Beneficiaries as required by this
Section 4.5 so long as, in each case, Molycorp delivers a certificate to the
Trustee stating that Molycorp has undertaken to perform the obligations of the
Trustee set forth in this Section 4.5.

 



 

 **4.6** ** ****List of Persons Entitled to Vote**

 



 

Exchangeco shall, (a) prior to each annual, general and special Molycorp
Meeting or the seeking of any Molycorp Consent and (b) forthwith upon each
request made at any time by the Trustee in writing, prepare or cause to be
prepared a list (a " **List** ") of the names and addresses of the
Beneficiaries arranged in alphabetical order and showing the number of
Exchangeable Shares held of record by each such Beneficiary, in each case at
the close of business on the date specified by the Trustee in such request or,
in the case of a List prepared in connection with a Molycorp Meeting or
Molycorp Consent, at the close of business on the record date established by
Molycorp or pursuant to applicable law for determining the holders of Molycorp
Shares entitled to receive notice of and/or to vote at such Molycorp Meeting
or to give consent in connection with a Molycorp Consent. Each such List shall
be delivered to the Trustee promptly after receipt by Exchangeco of such
request or the record date for such meeting or consent, as the case may be,
and, in any event, within sufficient time as to permit the Trustee to perform
its obligations under this Agreement. Molycorp agrees to give Exchangeco
notice (with a copy to the Trustee) of the calling of any Molycorp Meeting or
the seeking of any Molycorp Consent,

 



      
 

 



 

together with the record date therefor, sufficiently prior to the date of the
calling of such meeting or seeking of such consent, so as to enable Exchangeco
to perform its obligations under this Section 4.6.

 



 

 **4.7** ** ****Entitlement to Direct Votes**

 



 

Subject to Section 4.8 and Section 4.11, any Beneficiary named in a List
prepared in connection with any Molycorp Meeting or Molycorp Consent shall be
entitled to (a) instruct the Trustee in the manner described in Section 4.2
with respect to the exercise of the Beneficiary Votes to which such
Beneficiary is entitled, (b) attend such meeting and personally exercise
thereat (or to exercise with respect to any written consent), as the proxy of
the Trustee, the Beneficiary Votes to which such Beneficiary is entitled or
(c) appoint a third party as the proxy of the Trustee to attend such meeting
and exercise thereat the Beneficiary Votes to which such Beneficiary is
entitled except, in each case, to the extent that such Beneficiary has
transferred the ownership of any Exchangeable Shares in respect of which such
Beneficiary is entitled to Beneficiary Votes after the close of business on
the record date for such meeting or seeking of consent.

 



 

 **4.8** ** ****Voting by Trustee and Attendance of Trustee Representative at
Meeting**

 



 

(a) In connection with each Molycorp Meeting and Molycorp Consent, the Trustee
shall exercise, either in person or by proxy, in accordance with the
instructions received from a Beneficiary pursuant to Section 4.2, the
Beneficiary Votes as to which such Beneficiary is entitled to direct the vote
(or any lesser number thereof as may be set forth in the instructions) other
than any Beneficiary Votes that are the subject of Section 4.8(a); provided,
however, that such written instructions are received by the Trustee from the
Beneficiary prior to the time and date fixed by the Trustee for receipt of
such instruction in the notice given by the Trustee to the Beneficiary
pursuant to Section 4.3.

 



 

(b) To the extent so instructed in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Trustee shall cause a representative who is empowered by it to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the Trustee, proxies for Voting Rights enabling
a Beneficiary to attend a Molycorp Meeting. Upon submission by a Beneficiary
(or its designee) named in the List prepared in connection with the relevant
meeting of identification satisfactory to the Trustees representative, and at
the Beneficiarys request, such representative shall sign and deliver to such
Beneficiary (or its designee) a proxy to exercise personally the Beneficiary
Votes as to which such Beneficiary is otherwise entitled hereunder to direct
the vote, if such Beneficiary either (i) has not previously given the Trustee
instructions pursuant to Section 4.3 in respect of such meeting or (ii)
submits to such representative written revocation of any such previous
instructions. At such meeting, the Beneficiary (or its designee) exercising
such Beneficiary Votes in accordance with such proxy shall have the same
rights in respect of such Beneficiary Votes as the Trustee to speak at the
meeting in favour of any matter, question, proposal or proposition, to vote by
way of ballot at the meeting in respect of any matter, question, proposal or

 



      
 

 



 

proposition, and to vote at such meeting by way of a show of hands in respect
of any matter, question or proposition.

 



 

 **4.9** ** ****Distribution of Written Materials**

 



 

Any written materials distributed by the Trustee to the Beneficiaries pursuant
to this Agreement shall be sent by mail (or otherwise communicated in the same
manner as Molycorp utilizes in communications to holders of Molycorp Shares
subject to applicable regulatory requirements and to the Trustee being advised
in writing of such manner and provided such manner of communications is
reasonably available to the Trustee) to each Beneficiary at its address as
shown on the register of holders of Exchangeable Shares maintained by the
registrar. In connection with each such distribution, Exchangeco shall provide
or cause to be provided to the Trustee for purposes of communication, on a
timely basis and without charge or other expense (a) a current List and (b)
upon the request of the Trustee, mailing labels to enable the Trustee to carry
out its duties under this Agreement. Exchangecos obligations under this
Section 4.9 shall be deemed satisfied to the extent Molycorp exercises its
option to perform the duties of the Trustee to deliver copies of materials to
each Beneficiary and Exchangeco provides the required information and
materials to Molycorp.

 



 

 **4.10** ** ****Termination of Voting Rights**

 



 

Except as otherwise provided in the Exchangeable Share Provisions, all of the
rights of a Beneficiary with respect to the Beneficiary Votes exercisable in
respect of the Exchangeable Shares held by such Beneficiary, including the
right to instruct the Trustee as to the voting of or to vote personally such
Beneficiary Votes, shall lapse and be deemed to be surrendered by the
Beneficiary to Molycorp or Callco, as the case may be, and such Beneficiary
Votes and the Voting Rights represented thereby shall cease immediately upon:

 



 

(a) the delivery by such holder to the Trustee of the certificates
representing such Exchangeable Shares in connection with the exercise by the
Beneficiary of the Exchange Right;

 



 

(b) the occurrence of the automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares for
Molycorp Shares, as specified in Article 5;

 



 

(c) the retraction or redemption of Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section 6
or 7 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions;

 



 

(d) the effective date of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of
Exchangeco or any other distribution of the assets of Exchangeco among its
shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs pursuant to Section 5
of the Exchangeable Share Provisions; or

 



 

(e) upon the purchase of Exchangeable Shares from the holder thereof by
Molycorp or Callco, as the case may be, pursuant to the exercise by Molycorp
or Callco of the Liquidation Call Right, the Redemption Call Right, the Change
of Law Call Right or the Retraction Call Right (unless, in any case, Molycorp
or Callco, as the

 



      
 

 



 

case may be, shall not have delivered the requisite consideration deliverable
in exchange therefor).

 



 

 **4.11** ** ****Disclosure of Interest in Exchangeable Shares**

 



 

The Trustee or Exchangeco shall be entitled to require any Beneficiary or any
person whom the Trustee or Exchangeco, as the case may be, knows or has
reasonable cause to believe holds any interest whatsoever in an Exchangeable
Share to (a) confirm that fact or (b) give such details as to whom has an
interest in such Exchangeable Share, in each case as would be required (if the
Exchangeable Shares were a class of "equity shares" of Exchangeco) under
Section 102.1 of the _Securities Act_ (Ontario), as amended from time to time,
or as would be required under the articles or by-laws of Molycorp or any laws
or regulations, or pursuant to the rules or regulations of any regulatory
agency, if and only to the extent that the Exchangeable Shares were Molycorp
Shares. If a Beneficiary does not provide the information required to be
provided by such Beneficiary pursuant to this Section 4.11, the board of
directors of Molycorp may take any action permitted under the articles or by-
laws of Molycorp or any laws or regulations, or pursuant to the rules or
regulations of any regulatory agency, with respect to the Voting Rights
relating to the Exchangeable Shares held by such Beneficiary.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 5**

 



 

 **EXCHANGE AND AUTOMATIC EXCHANGE**

 



 

 **5.1** ** ****Grant and Ownership of the Exchange Right and Automatic
Exchange Right**

 



 

(a) Molycorp and, in the case the Exchange Right, Callco hereby grant to the
Trustee as trustee for and on behalf of, and for the use and benefit of, the
Beneficiaries (i) the right (the " **Exchange Right** "), upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Insolvency Event, to require Molycorp or
Callco to purchase from each or any Beneficiary all or any part of the
Exchangeable Shares held by such Beneficiary, all in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, and (ii) the Automatic Exchange Right. Each of
Molycorp and Callco hereby acknowledges receipt from the Trustee as trustee
for and on behalf of the Beneficiaries of good and valuable consideration (and
the adequacy thereof) for the grant of the Exchange Right and the Automatic
Exchange Right by Molycorp or Callco, as the case may be, to the Trustee.

 



 

(b) During the term of the Trust, and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Trustee shall possess and be vested with full legal
ownership of the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Right and shall be
entitled to exercise all of the rights and powers of an owner with respect to
the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Right, provided that the Trustee
shall:

 



 

(i) hold the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Right and the legal
title thereto as trustee solely for the use and benefit of the Beneficiaries
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; and

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) except as specifically authorized by this Agreement, have no power or
authority to exercise or otherwise deal in or with the Exchange Right or the
Automatic Exchange Right, and the Trustee shall not exercise any such rights
for any purpose other than the purposes for which the Trust is created
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

 **5.2** ** ****Legended Share Certificates**

 



 

Exchangeco shall cause each certificate representing Exchangeable Shares to
bear a legend notifying the Beneficiary in respect of the Exchangeable Shares
represented by such certificate of (a) his, her or its right to instruct the
Trustee with respect to the exercise of the Exchange Right in respect of the
Exchangeable Shares held by such Beneficiary and (b) the Automatic Exchange
Right.

 



 

 **5.3** ** ****General Exercise of Exchange Right**

 



 

The Exchange Right shall be and remain vested in and exercisable by Trustee.
Subject to Section 6.15, the Trustee shall exercise the Exchange Right only on
the basis of instructions received pursuant to this Article 5 from
Beneficiaries entitled to instruct the Trustee as to the exercise thereof. To
the extent that no instructions are received from any Beneficiary with respect
to the Exchange Right, the Trustee shall not exercise or permit the exercise
of the Exchange Right.

 



 

 **5.4** ** ****Purchase Price**

 



 

The purchase price payable by Molycorp or Callco, as the case may be, for each
Exchangeable Share to be purchased by Molycorp or Callco, as the case may be,
pursuant to the exercise of the Exchange Right shall be an amount per share
equal to the Exchangeable Share Price on the last Business Day prior to the
day of the closing of the purchase and sale of such Exchangeable Share
pursuant to such exercise of the Exchange Right, which price may be satisfied
only by Molycorp or Callco, as the case may be, delivering or causing to be
delivered to the Trustee, on behalf of the relevant Beneficiary, the
Exchangeable Share Consideration representing such Exchangeable Share Price.

 



 

 **5.5** ** ****Exercise Instructions**

 



 

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, a Beneficiary shall be
entitled upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Insolvency
Event, to instruct the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right with respect to
all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such
Beneficiary. In order to cause the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right with
respect to all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name
of a Beneficiary, such Beneficiary shall deliver to the Trustee, in person or
by certified or registered mail, at its principal office in Toronto, Ontario
or at such other place as the Trustee may from time to time designate by
written notice to the Beneficiaries, the certificates representing the
Exchangeable Shares which such Beneficiary desires Molycorp or Callco to
purchase, duly endorsed in blank for transfer, and accompanied by such other
documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of the
Exchangeable Shares under the _Business Corporations_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Act_ (British Columbia), the articles or by-laws of Exchangeco and such
additional documents and instruments as Molycorp, Exchangeco or the Trustee
may reasonably require together with:

 



 

(a) a duly completed form of notice of exercise of the Exchange Right,
contained on the reverse of or attached to the Exchangeable Share
certificates, stating (i) that the Beneficiary thereby instructs the Trustee
to exercise the Exchange Right so as to require Molycorp or Callco to purchase
from the Beneficiary the number of Exchangeable Shares specified therein, (ii)
that such Beneficiary has good title to and owns all such Exchangeable Shares
to be acquired by Molycorp or Callco free and clear of all liens, claims,
security interests and encumbrances, (iii) the names in which the certificates
representing Molycorp Shares issuable in connection with the exercise of the
Exchange Right are to be issued, and (iv) the names and addresses of the
persons to whom such new certificates should be delivered; and

 



 

(b) payment (or evidence satisfactory to Molycorp, Exchangeco and the Trustee
of payment) of the taxes (if any) payable as contemplated by Section 5.7 of
this Agreement.

 



 

If only a part of the Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate or
certificates delivered to the Trustee are to be purchased by Molycorp or
Callco pursuant to the exercise of the Exchange Right, a new certificate for
the balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the holder at the
expense of Exchangeco.

 



 

 **5.6** ** ****Delivery of Molycorp Shares; Effect of Exercise**

 



 

Promptly after the receipt by the Trustee of the certificates representing the
Exchangeable Shares which a Beneficiary desires Molycorp or Callco to purchase
pursuant to the exercise of the Exchange Right, together with a notice of
exercise and such other documents and instruments specified by Section 5.5,
the Trustee shall notify Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco of its receipt of the
same, which notice to Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco shall constitute
exercise of the Exchange Right by the Trustee on behalf of such Beneficiary in
respect of such Exchangeable Shares, and Molycorp or Callco, as the case may
be, shall promptly thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee,
for delivery to such Beneficiary (or to such other persons, if any, properly
designated by such Beneficiary) the Exchangeable Share Consideration
deliverable in connection with such exercise of the Exchange Right; provided,
however, that no such delivery shall be made unless and until the Beneficiary
requesting the same shall have paid (or provided evidence satisfactory to
Molycorp, Callco, Exchangeco and the Trustee of the payment of) the taxes (if
any) payable as contemplated by Section 5.7 of this Agreement. Immediately
upon the giving of notice by the Trustee to Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco of
any exercise of the Exchange Right, as provided in this Section 5.6, the
closing of the transaction of purchase and sale contemplated by the Exchange
Right shall be deemed to have occurred, and the Beneficiary in respect of such
Exchangeable Shares shall be deemed to have transferred to Molycorp or Callco,
as the case may be, all of such Beneficiarys right, title and interest in and
to such Exchangeable Shares and in the related interest in the Trust Estate
and shall cease to be a holder of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other
than the right to receive the total Exchangeable Share Consideration in

 



      
 

 



 

respect of such Exchangeable Shares, unless such Exchangeable Share
Consideration is not delivered by Molycorp or Callco, as the case may be, to
the Trustee for delivery to such Beneficiary (or to such other person, if any,
properly designated by such Beneficiary) within five Business Days of the date
of the giving of such notice by the Trustee, in which case the rights of the
Beneficiary shall remain unaffected until such Exchangeable Share
Consideration is so delivered. Upon delivery of such Exchangeable Share
Consideration to the Trustee, the Trustee shall promptly deliver such
Exchangeable Share Consideration to such Beneficiary (or to such other person,
if any, properly designated by such Beneficiary). Concurrently with the
closing of the transaction of purchase and sale contemplated by such exercise
of the Exchange Right, the Beneficiary shall be considered and deemed for all
purposes to be the holder of the Molycorp Shares delivered to it pursuant to
such exercise of the Exchange Right.

 



 

 **5.7** ** ****Exercise of Exchange Right Subsequent to Retraction**

 



 

In the event that a Beneficiary has exercised its retraction right under
Section 6 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions to require Exchangeco to redeem
any or all of the Exchangeable Shares held by the Beneficiary (the "
**Retracted Shares** ") and is notified by Exchangeco pursuant to Section
6(a)(iii) of the Exchangeable Share Provisions that Exchangeco will not be
permitted as a result of solvency requirements of applicable law to redeem all
such Retracted Shares, subject to receipt by the Trustee of written notice to
that effect from Exchangeco, and provided that neither Molycorp nor Callco
shall have exercised its Retraction Call Right with respect to the Retracted
Shares and that the Beneficiary shall not have revoked the retraction request
delivered by the Beneficiary to Exchangeco pursuant to Section 6(a)(iv) of the
Exchangeable Share Provisions, the retraction request will constitute and will
be deemed to constitute notice from the Beneficiary to the Trustee instructing
the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right with respect to those Retracted
Shares that Exchangeco is unable to redeem. In any such event, Exchangeco
hereby agrees with the Trustee, and in favour of the Beneficiary, promptly to
notify the Trustee of such prohibition against Exchangeco and to forward or
cause to be forwarded to the Trustee all relevant materials delivered by the
Beneficiary to Exchangeco or to the Transfer Agent in connection with such
proposed redemption of the Retracted Shares and the Trustee will thereupon
exercise the Exchange Right with respect to the Retracted Shares that
Exchangeco is not permitted to redeem and will require Molycorp or, at the
option of Molycorp, Callco to purchase such shares in accordance with the
provisions of this Article 5

 



 

 **5.8** ** ****Stamp or Other Transfer Taxes**

 



 

Upon any sale of Exchangeable Shares to Molycorp pursuant to the exercise of
the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Right, the share certificate or
certificates representing the Molycorp Shares to be delivered in connection
with the payment of the purchase price therefor shall be issued in the name of
the Beneficiary in respect of the Exchangeable Shares so sold or in such names
as such Beneficiary may otherwise direct in writing without charge to the
holder of the Exchangeable Shares so sold; provided, however, that such
Beneficiary (a) shall pay (and none of Molycorp, Callco, Exchangeco or the
Trustee shall be required to pay) any documentary, stamp, transfer of other
taxes that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance
or delivery of such shares to a person other than such Beneficiary or (b)
shall have evidenced to the satisfaction of Molycorp, Callco, Exchangeco and
the Trustee that such taxes (if any) have been paid.

 



      
 

 



 

 **5.9** ** ****Notice of Insolvency Event**

 



 

As soon as practicable following the occurrence of an Insolvency Event or any
event that with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would be
an Insolvency Event, Molycorp and Exchangeco shall give written notice thereof
to the Trustee. As soon as practicable after receiving notice from Molycorp or
Exchangeco of the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, or upon the Trustee
otherwise becoming aware of an Insolvency Event, the Trustee shall mail to
each Beneficiary, at the expense of Molycorp (such funds to be received in
advance), a notice of such Insolvency Event in the form provided by Molycorp,
which notice shall contain a brief statement of the rights of the
Beneficiaries with respect to the Exchange Right.

 



 

 **5.10** ** ****Automatic Exchange on Liquidation of Molycorp**

 



 

(a) Molycorp shall give the Trustee written notice of each of the following
events (each, a " **Liquidation Event** ") at the time set forth below:

 



 

(i) in the event of any determination by the board of directors of Molycorp to
institute voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up proceedings with
respect to Molycorp or to effect any other distribution of assets of Molycorp
among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, at least 30
days prior to the proposed effective date of such liquidation, dissolution,
winding-up or other distribution; and

 



 

(ii) as soon as practicable following the earlier of (A) receipt by Molycorp
of notice of and (B) Molycorp otherwise becoming aware of any instituted
claim, suit, petition or other proceedings with respect to the involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Molycorp or to effect any other
distribution of assets of Molycorp among its shareholders for the purpose of
winding up its affairs, in each case where Molycorp has failed to contest in
good faith any such proceeding commenced in respect of Molycorp within 10 days
of becoming aware thereof.

 



 

(b) As soon as practicable following receipt by the Trustee from Molycorp of
notice of a Liquidation Event, the Trustee shall give notice thereof to the
Beneficiaries. Such notice shall be provided by Molycorp to the Trustee and
shall include a brief description of the automatic exchange of Exchangeable
Shares for Molycorp Shares provided for in Section 5.10(c) (the " **Automatic
Exchange Right** ").

 



 

(c) In order that the Beneficiaries will be able to participate on a pro rata
basis with the holders of Molycorp Shares in the distribution of assets of
Molycorp in connection with a Liquidation Event, immediately prior to the
effective date (the " **Liquidation Event Effective Date** ") of a Liquidation
Event, each of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares (other than
Exchangeable Shares held by Molycorp and its affiliates) shall be
automatically exchanged for one Molycorp Share. To effect such automatic
exchange, Molycorp shall purchase each such Exchangeable Share outstanding
immediately prior to the Liquidation Event Effective Date, and each
Beneficiary shall sell each Exchangeable Shares held by

 



      
 

 



 

it at such time, free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance, for a
purchase price per share equal to Exchangeable Share Price on the last
Business Day immediately prior to the Liquidation Event Effective Date, which
price shall be satisfied in full by Molycorp delivering to such holder the
Exchangeable Share Consideration representing such Exchangeable Share Price.

 



 

(d) The closing of the transaction of purchase and sale contemplated by any
exercise of the Automatic Exchange Right shall be deemed to have occurred at
the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the Liquidation
Event Effective Date, and each Beneficiary shall be deemed to have transferred
to Molycorp all of such Beneficiarys right, title and interest in and to the
Exchangeable Shares held by such Beneficiary free and clear of any lien, claim
or encumbrance and the related interest in the Trust Estate and each such
Beneficiary shall cease to be a holder of such Exchangeable Shares and
Molycorp shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee, for delivery
to such Beneficiary, the Exchangeable Share Consideration deliverable to such
Beneficiary upon such exercise of the Automatic Exchange Right. Concurrently
with each such Beneficiary ceasing to be a holder of Exchangeable Shares, such
Beneficiary shall be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder
of the Molycorp Shares included in the Exchangeable Share Consideration to be
delivered to such Beneficiary and the certificates held by such Beneficiary
previously representing the Exchangeable Shares exchanged by the Beneficiary
with Molycorp pursuant to the exercise of the Automatic Exchange Right shall
thereafter be deemed to represent the Molycorp Shares issued to such
Beneficiary by Molycorp pursuant to the exercise of the Automatic Exchange
Right. Upon the request of any Beneficiary and the surrender by such
Beneficiary of Exchangeable Share certificates deemed to represent Molycorp
Shares, duly endorsed in blank and accompanied by such instruments of transfer
as Molycorp may reasonably require, Molycorp shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to such Beneficiary certificates representing the Molycorp Shares of
which the Beneficiary is the holder.

 



 

 **5.11** ** ****Withholding Rights**

 



 

Molycorp, Callco, Exchangeco and the Trustee shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any dividend, distribution, price or other consideration
otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Exchangeable Shares or
Molycorp Shares such amounts as Molycorp, Callco, Exchangeco or the Trustee is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the _Income
Tax Act_ (Canada) or United States tax laws or any provision of provincial,
state, local or foreign tax Law, in each case as amended or succeeded. The
Trustee may act and rely on the advice of counsel with respect to such
matters. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder of the
shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided
that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing
agency. To the extent that the amount so required to be deducted or withheld
from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration
otherwise payable to the holder, Molycorp, Callco, Exchangeco and the Trustee
are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of

 



      
 

 



 

the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Molycorp,
Callco, Exchangeco or the Trustee, as the case may be, to enable it to comply
with such deduction or withholding requirement and Molycorp, Callco,
Exchangeco or the Trustee, as the case may be, shall notify the holder thereof
and remit to such holder any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such
sale.

action or proceeding by virtue of the powers conferred on it hereby unless and
until it shall be specifically required to do so under the terms hereof; nor
shall the Trustee be required to take any notice of, or to do, or to take any
act, action or proceeding as a result of any default or breach of any
provision hereunder, unless and until notified in writing of such default or
breach, which notices shall distinctly specify the default or breach desired
to be brought to the attention of the Trustee, and in the absence of such
notice the Trustee may for all purposes of this Agreement conclusively assume
that no default or breach has been made in the observance or performance of
any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or conditions
contained herein.

 



 

 **6.2** ** ****No Conflict of Interest**

 



 

The Trustee represents to Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco that, at the date of
execution and delivery of this Agreement, there exists no material conflict of
interest in the role of the Trustee as a fiduciary hereunder and the role of
the Trustee in any other capacity. The Trustee shall, within 90 days after it
becomes aware that such material conflict of interest exists, either eliminate
such material conflict of interest or resign in the manner and with the effect
specified in Article 9. If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.2, the Trustee has such a material conflict of interest, the
validity and enforceability of this Agreement shall not be affected in any
manner whatsoever by reason only of the existence of such material conflict of
interest. If the Trustee contravenes the foregoing provisions of this Section
6.2, any interested party may apply to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice
for an order that the Trustee be replaced as Trustee hereunder.

 



 

 **6.3** ** ****Dealings with Transfer Agents, Registrars, etc.**

 



 

(a) Each of Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco irrevocably authorizes the
Trustee, from time to time, to:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) consult, communicate and otherwise deal with the respective registrars and
transfer agents, and with any such subsequent registrar or transfer agent, of
the Exchangeable Shares and Molycorp Shares; and

 



 

(ii) requisition, from time to time, from any such registrar or transfer
agent, any information readily available from the records maintained by it
which the Trustee may reasonably require for the discharge of its duties and
responsibilities under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each of Molycorp and Callco covenants that it shall supply the Trustee or
its transfer agent, as the case may be, in a timely manner with duly executed
share certificates for the purpose of completing the exercise from time to
time of all rights to acquire Molycorp Shares hereunder, under the
Exchangeable Share Provisions and under any other security or commitment given
to the Beneficiaries pursuant thereto, in each case pursuant to the provisions
hereof or of the Exchangeable Share Provisions or otherwise.

 



 

 **6.4** ** ****Books and Records**

 



 

The Trustee shall keep available for inspection by Molycorp, Callco and
Exchangeco at the Trustees principal office in Toronto, Ontario correct and
complete books and records of account relating to the Trustees actions under
this Agreement, including all relevant data relating to mailings and
instructions to and from Beneficiaries and all transactions pursuant to the
Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Right. On or before [*], and on or
before [*] in every year thereafter, so long as the Special Voting Share is
registered in the name of the Trustee, the Trustee shall transmit to Molycorp,
Callco and Exchangeco a brief report, dated as of the preceding December 31st,
with respect to:

 



 

(a) the property and funds comprising the Trust Estate as of that date;

 



 

(b) the number of exercises of the Exchange Right, if any, and the aggregate
number of Exchangeable Shares received by the Trustee on behalf of
Beneficiaries in consideration of the issuance and delivery by Molycorp or
Callco of Molycorp Shares in connection with the Exchange Right, during the
calendar year ended on such December 31st; and

 



 

(c) any action taken by the Trustee in the performance of its duties under
this Agreement which it had not previously reported.

 



 

 **6.5** ** ****Income Tax Returns and Reports**

 



 

The Trustee shall, to the extent necessary, prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, on behalf of the Trust appropriate Canadian income tax
returns and any other returns or reports as may be required by applicable law
or pursuant to the rules and regulations of any securities exchange or other
trading system through which the Exchangeable Shares are traded. In connection
therewith, the Trustee may obtain the advice and assistance of such experts or
advisors as the Trustee considers necessary or advisable. If requested by the
Trustee, Molycorp

 



      
 

 



 

shall retain qualified experts or advisors for the purpose of providing such
tax advice or assistance.

 



 

 **6.6** ** ****Indemnification Prior to Certain Actions by Trustee**

 



 

(a) The Trustee shall exercise any or all of the rights, duties, powers or
authorities vested in it by this Agreement at the request, order or direction
of any Beneficiary upon such Beneficiary furnishing to the Trustee reasonable
funding, security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which may be incurred by the Trustee therein or thereby, provided that no
Beneficiary shall be obligated to furnish to the Trustee any such funding,
security or indemnity in connection with the exercise by the Trustee of any of
its rights, duties, powers and authorities with respect to the Special Voting
Share pursuant to Article 4, subject to Section 6.15, and with respect to the
Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Right pursuant to Article 5.

 



 

(b) None of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall require the
Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability
in the exercise of any of its rights, powers, duties, or authorities unless
funded, given security and indemnified as aforesaid.

 



 

 **6.7** ** ****Action of Beneficiaries**

 



 

No Beneficiary shall have the right to institute any action, suit or
proceeding or to exercise any other remedy authorized by this Agreement for
the purpose of enforcing any of its rights or for the execution of any trust
or power hereunder unless the Beneficiary has requested the Trustee to take or
institute such action, suit or proceeding and furnished the Trustee with the
funding, security or indemnity referred to in Section 6.6 and the Trustee
shall have failed to act within a reasonable time thereafter. In such case,
but not otherwise, the Beneficiary shall be entitled to take proceedings in
any court of competent jurisdiction such as the Trustee might have taken; it
being understood and intended that no one or more Beneficiaries shall have any
right in any manner whatsoever to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights
hereby created by any such action, or to enforce any right hereunder or the
Voting Rights, the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Right except
subject to the conditions and in the manner herein provided, and that all
powers and trusts hereunder shall be exercised and all proceedings at law
shall be instituted, had and maintained by the Trustee, except only as herein
provided, and in any event for the equal benefit of all Beneficiaries.

 



 

 **6.8** ** ****Reliance Upon Declarations**

 



 

The Trustee shall not be considered to be in contravention of any of its
rights, powers, duties and authorities hereunder if, when required, it acts
and relies in good faith upon statutory declarations, certificates, opinions
or reports furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof or required by the
Trustee to be furnished to it in the exercise of its rights, powers, duties
and authorities hereunder if such statutory declarations, certificates,
opinions or reports comply with the provisions of Section 6.9, if applicable,
and with any other applicable provisions of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **6.9** ** ****Evidence and Authority to Trustee**

 



 

(a) Molycorp, Callco and/or Exchangeco shall furnish to the Trustee evidence

any action or step required or permitted to be taken by Molycorp, Callco
and/or Exchangeco or the Trustee under this Agreement or as a result of any
obligation imposed under this Agreement, including in respect of the Voting
Rights, the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Right and the taking of
any other action to be taken by the Trustee at the request of or on the
application of Molycorp, Callco and/or Exchangeco promptly if and when:

 



 

(i) such evidence is required by any other section of this Agreement to be
furnished to the Trustee in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.9; or

 



 

(ii) the Trustee, in the exercise of its rights, powers, duties and
authorities under this Agreement, gives Molycorp, Callco and/or Exchangeco
written notice requiring it to furnish such evidence in relation to any
particular action or obligation specified in such notice.

 



 

(b) Such evidence shall consist of an Officers Certificate of Molycorp,
Callco and/or Exchangeco or a statutory declaration or a certificate made by
persons entitled to sign an Officers Certificate stating that any such
condition has been complied with in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) Whenever such evidence relates to a matter other than the Voting Rights or
the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Right or the taking of any other
action to be taken by the Trustee at the request or on the application of
Molycorp, Callco and/or Exchangeco, and except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, such evidence may consist of a report or opinion of any
solicitor, attorney, auditor, accountant, appraiser, valuer or other expert or
any other person whose qualifications give authority to a statement made by
such person; provided, however, that if such report or opinion is furnished by
a director, officer or employee of Molycorp, Callco and/or Exchangeco it shall
be in the form of an Officers Certificate or a statutory declaration.

 



 

(d) Each statutory declaration, Officers Certificate, opinion or report
furnished to the Trustee as evidence of compliance with a condition provided
for in this Agreement shall include a statement by the person giving the
evidence:

 



 

(i) declaring that such person has read and understands the provisions of this
Agreement relating to the condition in question;

 



 

(ii) describing the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon
which such person based the statutory declaration, certificate, statement or
opinion; and

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) declaring that such person has made such examination or investigation as
such person believes is necessary to enable such person to make the statements
or give the opinions contained or expressed therein.

 



 

 **6.10** ** ****Experts, Advisers and Agents**

 



 

The Trustee may:

 



 

(a) in relation to these presents act and rely on the opinion or advice of or
information obtained from any solicitor, attorney, auditor, accountant,
appraiser, valuer or other expert, whether retained by the Trustee or by
Molycorp, Callco and/or Exchangeco or otherwise, and may retain or employ such
assistants as may be necessary to the proper discharge of its powers and
duties and determination of its rights hereunder and may pay proper and
reasonable compensation for all such legal and other advice or assistance as
aforesaid;

 



 

(b) employ such agents and other assistants as it may reasonably require for
the proper determination and discharge of its powers and duties hereunder; and

 



 

(c) pay reasonable remuneration for all services performed for it (and shall
be entitled to receive reasonable remuneration for all services performed by
it) in the discharge of the trusts hereof and compensation for all reasonable
disbursements, costs and expenses made or incurred by it in the discharge of
its duties hereunder and in the management of the Trust.

 



 

 **6.11** ** ****Investment of Moneys Held by Trustee**

 



 

Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, any moneys held by or on behalf
of the Trustee which under the terms of this Agreement may or ought to be
invested or which may be on deposit with the Trustee or which may be in the
hands of the Trustee may be invested or reinvested in the name or under the
control of the Trustee in securities in which, under the laws of the Province
of Ontario, trustees are authorized to invest trust moneys, provided that such
securities are stated to mature within two years after their purchase by the
Trustee and the Trustee shall so invest such money on the written direction of
Exchangeco. Pending the investment of any money as herein provided, such
moneys may be deposited in the name of the Trustee in any chartered bank in
Canada or, with the consent of Exchangeco, in the deposit department of the
Trustee or any other specified loan or trust company authorized to accept
deposits under the laws of Canada or any province thereof at the rate of
interest then current on similar deposits. The Trustee shall not be held
liable for any losses incurred in the investment of any funds as herein
provided and all interest on monies held by or on behalf of the Trustee shall
be for the account of Exchangeco and held by the Trustee for the benefit of
Exchangeco.

 



 

 **6.12** ** ****Trustee Not Required to Give Security**

 



 

The Trustee shall not be required to give any bond or security in respect of
the execution of the trusts, rights, duties, powers and authorities of this
Agreement or otherwise in respect of the premises.

 



      
 

 



 

 **6.13** ** ****Trustee Not Bound to Act on Request**

 



 

Except as in this Agreement otherwise specifically provided, the Trustee shall
not be bound to act in accordance with any direction or request of Molycorp,
Callco and/or Exchangeco or of the respective directors thereof until a duly
authenticated copy of the instrument or resolution containing such direction
or request shall have been delivered to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall be
empowered to act upon any such copy purporting to be authenticated and
believed by the Trustee to be genuine. The Trustee shall have the right not to
act and shall not be liable for refusing to act if, due to a lack of
information or for any other reason whatsoever, the Trustee, in its sole
judgment, determines that such act might cause it to be in non-compliance with
any applicable anti-money laundering or anti-terrorist legislation or
regulation. Further, should the Trustee, in its sole judgment, determine at
any time that its acting under this Agreement has resulted in its being in
non-compliance with any applicable anti-money laundering or anti-terrorist
legislation or regulation, then it shall have the right to resign on ten days
written notice to the other parties to this Agreement, provided that (a) the
Trustees written notice shall describe the circumstances of such non-
compliance and (b) if such circumstances are rectified to the Trustees
satisfaction within such ten day period, such resignation shall not be
effective.

 



 

 **6.14** ** ****Authority to Carry on Business**

 



 

The Trustee represents to Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco that, at the date of
execution and delivery by it of this Agreement, it is authorized to carry on
the business of a trust company in each of the provinces and territories of
Canada but if, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.14, it ceases
to be so authorized to carry on business, the validity and enforceability of
this Agreement and the Voting Rights, the Exchange Right and the Automatic
Exchange Right and the other rights granted in or resulting from the Trustee
being a party to this Agreement shall not be affected in any manner whatsoever
by reason only of such event but the Trustee shall, within 90 days after
ceasing to be authorized to carry on the business of a trust company in any
province or territory of Canada, either become so authorized or resign in the
manner and with the effect specified in Article 9.

 



 

 **6.15** ** ****Conflicting Claims**

 



 

(a) If conflicting claims or demands are made or asserted with respect to any
interest of any Beneficiary in any Exchangeable Shares, including any
disagreement between the heirs, representatives, successors or assigns
succeeding to all or any part of the interest of any Beneficiary in any
Exchangeable Shares, resulting in conflicting claims or demands being made in
connection with such interest, then the Trustee shall be entitled, in its sole
discretion, to refuse to recognize or to comply with any such claims or
demands. In so refusing, the Trustee may elect not to exercise any Voting
Rights, Exchange Right, Automatic Exchange Right or other rights subject to
such conflicting claims or demands and, in so doing, the Trustee shall not be
or become liable to any person on account of such election or its failure or
refusal to comply with any such conflicting claims or demands. The Trustee
shall be entitled to continue to refrain from acting and to refuse to act
until:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) the rights of all adverse claimants with respect to the Voting Rights,
Exchange Right, Automatic Exchange Right or other rights subject to such
conflicting claims or demands have been adjudicated by a final judgement of a
court of competent jurisdiction and all rights of appeal have expired; or

 



 

(ii) all differences with respect to the Voting Rights, Exchange Right,
Automatic Exchange Right or other rights subject to such conflicting claims or
demands have been conclusively settled by a valid written agreement binding on
all such adverse claimants, and the Trustee shall have been furnished with an
executed copy of such agreement certified to be in full force and effect.

 



 

(b) If the Trustee elects to recognize any claim or comply with any demand
made by any such adverse claimant, it may in its discretion require such
claimant to furnish such surety bond or other security satisfactory to the
Trustee as it shall deem appropriate to fully indemnify it as between all
conflicting claims or demands.

 



 

 **6.16** ** ****Acceptance of Trust**

 



 

The Trustee hereby accepts the Trust created and provided for, by and in this
Agreement and agrees to perform the same upon the terms and conditions herein
set forth and to hold all rights, privileges and benefits conferred hereby and
by law in trust for the various persons who shall from time to time be
Beneficiaries, subject to all the terms and conditions herein set forth.

 



 

 **6.17** ** ****Third Party Interests**

 



 

Each party to this Agreement hereby represents to the Trustee that any account
to be opened by, or interest to be held by the Trustee in connection with this
Agreement, for or to the credit of such party, either (a) is not intended to
be used by or on behalf of any third party or (b) is intended to be used by or
on behalf of a third party, in which case such party hereto agrees to complete
and execute forthwith a declaration in the Trustees prescribed form as to the
particulars of such third party.

 



 

 **6.18** ** ****Privacy**

 



 

The parties acknowledge that Canadian federal and/or provincial legislation
that addresses the protection of individuals personal information
(collectively, " **Privacy Laws** ") applies to obligations and activities
under this Agreement. Despite any other provision of this Agreement, no party
shall take or direct any action that would contravene, or cause the others to
contravene, applicable Privacy Laws. The parties shall, prior to transferring
or causing to be transferred personal information to the Trustee, obtain and
retain required consents of the relevant individuals to the collection, use
and disclosure of their personal information, or shall have determined that
such consents either have previously been given upon which the parties can
rely or are not required under the Privacy Laws. Specifically, the Trustee
agrees (a) to have a designated chief privacy officer, (b) to maintain
policies and procedures to protect personal information and to receive and
respond to any privacy complaint or inquiry, (c) to use personal

 



      
 

 



 

information solely for the purposes of providing its services under or
ancillary to this Agreement and not to use it for any purpose except with the
consent of or direction from the other parties or the individual involved, (d)
not to sell or otherwise improperly disclose personal information to any third
part and (e) to employ administrative, physical and technological safeguards
to reasonably secure and protect personal information against loss, theft, or
unauthorized access, use or modification.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 7**

 



 

 **COMPENSATION**

 



 

 **7.1** ** ****Fees and Expenses of the Trustee**

 



 

Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco jointly and severally agree to pay the Trustee
reasonable compensation for all of the services rendered by it under this
Agreement and shall reimburse the Trustee for all reasonable expenses
(including taxes (other than taxes based on the net income or capital of the
Trustee), fees paid to legal counsel and other experts and advisors and agents
and travel expenses) and disbursements, including the cost and expense of any
suit or litigation of any character and any proceedings before any
governmental agency, in each case reasonably incurred by the Trustee in
connection with its duties under this Agreement; provided, however, that
Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco shall have no obligation to reimburse the
Trustee for any expenses or disbursements paid, incurred or suffered by the
Trustee in any suit or litigation or any such proceedings in which the Trustee
is determined to have acted in bad faith or with fraud, gross negligence,
recklessness or wilful misconduct.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 8**

 



 

 **INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

 



 

 **8.1** ** ****Indemnification of the Trustee**

 



 

(a) Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco jointly and severally agree to indemnify
and hold harmless the Trustee and each of its directors, officers, employees
and agents appointed and acting in accordance with this Agreement
(collectively, the " **Indemnified Parties** ") against all claims, losses,
damages, reasonable costs, penalties, fines and reasonable expenses (including
reasonable expenses of the Trustees legal counsel) which, without bad faith,
fraud, gross negligence, recklessness or wilful misconduct on the part of such
Indemnified Party, may be paid, incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party
by reason or as a result of the Trustees acceptance or administration of the
Trust, its compliance with its duties set forth in this Agreement, or any
written or oral instruction delivered to the Trustee by Molycorp, Callco or
Exchangeco pursuant hereto.

 



 

(b) The Trustee shall promptly notify Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco of a
claim or of any action commenced against any Indemnified Parties promptly
after the Trustee or any of the Indemnified Parties shall have received
written assertion of such a claim or action or have been served with a summons
or other first legal

 



      
 

 



 

process giving information as to the nature and basis of the claim or action;
provided, however, that the omission to so notify Molycorp, Callco or
Exchangeco shall not relieve Molycorp, Callco or Exchangeco of any liability
which any of them may have to any Indemnified Party except to the extent that
any such delay prejudices the defence of any such claim or action or results
in any increase in the liability which Molycorp, Callco or Exchangeco have
under this indemnity. Subject to (ii) below, Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco
shall be entitled to participate at their own expense in the defence and, if
Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco so elect at any time after receipt of such
notice, either of them may assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce
any such claim. The Trustee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such suit and participate in the defence thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Trustee unless (i) the
employment of such counsel has been authorized by Molycorp, Callco or
Exchangeco or (ii) the named parties to any such suit include both the Trustee
and Molycorp, Callco or Exchangeco and the Trustee shall have been advised by
counsel acceptable to Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco that there may be one or
more legal defences available to the Trustee that are different from or in
addition to those available to Molycorp, Callco or Exchangeco and that, in the
judgement of such counsel, would present a conflict of interest were a joint
representation to be undertaken (in which case Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco
shall not have the right to assume the defence of such suit on behalf of the
Trustee but shall be liable to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
for the Trustee). This indemnity shall survive the termination of the Trust
and the resignation or removal of the Trustee.

 



 

 **8.2** ** ****Limitation of Liability**

 



 

The Trustee shall not be held liable for any loss which may occur by reason of
depreciation of the value of any part of the Trust Estate or any loss incurred
on any investment of funds pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent
that such loss is attributable to the bad faith, fraud, gross negligence,
recklessness or wilful misconduct on the part of the Trustee.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 9**

 



 

 **CHANGE OF TRUSTEE**

 



 

 **9.1** ** ****Resignation**

 



 

The Trustee, or any trustee hereafter appointed, may at any time resign by
giving written notice of such resignation to Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco
specifying the date on which it desires to resign, provided that such notice
shall not be given less than 30 days before such desired resignation date
unless Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco otherwise agree and provided further
that such resignation shall not take effect until the date of the appointment
of a successor trustee and the acceptance of such appointment by the successor
trustee. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, Molycorp, Callco and
Exchangeco shall promptly appoint a successor trustee, which successor trustee
shall be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Canada and
authorized to carry on the business of a trust company in all provinces and
territories

 



      
 

 



 

of Canada, by written instrument in duplicate, one copy of which shall be
delivered to the resigning trustee and one copy to the successor trustee.
Failing the appointment and acceptance of a successor trustee, a successor
trustee may be appointed by order of a court of competent jurisdiction upon
application of one or more of the parties to this Agreement. If the retiring
trustee is the party initiating an application for the appointment of a
successor trustee by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, Molycorp,
Callco and Exchangeco shall be jointly and severally liable to reimburse the
retiring trustee for its legal costs and expenses in connection with same.

 



 

 **9.2** ** ****Removal**

 



 

The Trustee, or any trustee hereafter appointed, may (provided a successor
trustee is appointed) be removed at any time on not less than 30 days prior
notice by written instrument executed by Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco, in
duplicate, one copy of which shall be delivered to the trustee so removed and
one copy to the successor trustee, provided that such removal shall not take
effect until the date of acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee.

 



 

 **9.3** ** ****Successor Trustee**

 



 

Any successor trustee appointed as provided under this Agreement shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco and to its
predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment. Thereupon the
resignation or removal of the predecessor trustee shall become effective and
such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall
become vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its
predecessor under this Agreement, with the like effect as if originally named
as trustee in this Agreement. However, on the written request of Molycorp,
Callco and Exchangeco or of the successor trustee, the trustee ceasing to act
shall, upon payment of any amounts then due to it pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such
successor trustee all the rights and powers of the trustee so ceasing to act.
Upon the request of any such successor trustee, Molycorp, Callco, Exchangeco
and such predecessor trustee shall execute any and all instruments in writing
for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor
trustee all such rights and powers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
corporation to which all or substantially all of the business of the Trustee
is transferred shall automatically become the successor trustee without any
further act.

 



 

 **9.4** ** ****Notice of Successor Trustee**

 



 

Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided herein,
Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco shall cause to be mailed notice of the
succession of such trustee hereunder to each Beneficiary specified in a List.
If Molycorp, Callco or Exchangeco shall fail to cause such notice to be mailed
within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the
successor trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of
Molycorp, Callco and Exchangeco.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 10**

 



 

 **MOLYCORP SUCCESSORS**

 



 

 **10.1** ** ****Certain Requirements in Respect of Combination, etc.**

 



 

So long as any Exchangeable Shares not owned by Molycorp or its affiliates are
outstanding, Molycorp shall not enter into any transaction (whether by way of
reconstruction, reorganization, consolidation, arrangement, amalgamation,
merger, transfer, sale, lease or otherwise) whereby all or substantially all
of its undertaking, property and assets would become the property of any other
person or, in the case of a merger, of the continuing corporation resulting
therefrom, provided that it may do so if:

 



 

(a) such other person or continuing corporation (the " **Molycorp Successor**
"), by operation of law, becomes, without more, bound by the terms and
provisions of this Agreement or, if not so bound, executes, prior to or
contemporaneously with the consummation of such transaction, a trust agreement
supplemental hereto and such other instruments (if any) as are necessary or
advisable to evidence the assumption by the Molycorp Successor of liability
for all moneys payable and property deliverable hereunder and the covenant of
such Molycorp Successor to pay and deliver or cause to be delivered the same
and its agreement to observe and perform all the covenants and obligations of
Molycorp under this Agreement; and

 



 

(b) such transaction shall be upon such terms and conditions as substantially
to preserve and not to impair in any material respect any of the rights,
duties, powers and authorities of the Trustee or of the Beneficiaries
hereunder.

 



 

 **10.2** ** ****Vesting of Powers in Successor**

 



 

Whenever the conditions of Section 10.1 have been duly observed and performed,
the parties, if required by Section 10.1, shall execute and deliver the
supplemental trust agreement provided for in Article 11 and thereupon the
Molycorp Successor and such other person that may then be the issuer of the
Molycorp Shares shall possess and from time to time may exercise each and
every right and power of Molycorp under this Agreement in the name of Molycorp
or otherwise and any act or proceeding by any provision of this Agreement
required to be done or performed by the board of directors of Molycorp or any
officers of Molycorp may be done and performed with like force and effect by
the directors or officers of such Molycorp Successor.

 



 

 **10.3** ** ****Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries**

 



 

Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing (a) the amalgamation or merger
of any wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of Molycorp with or into
Molycorp, (b) the winding-up, liquidation or dissolution of any wholly-owned
direct or indirect subsidiary of Molycorp, provided that all of the assets of
such subsidiary are transferred to Molycorp or another wholly-owned direct or
indirect subsidiary of Molycorp, (c) any other distribution of the assets of
any wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of Molycorp among the
shareholders of such

 



      
 

 



 

subsidiary for the purpose of winding up its affairs and (d) any such
transactions which are expressly permitted by this Article 10.

 



 

 **10.4** ** ****Successor Transactions**

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 10, in the event of a
Molycorp Control Transaction:

 



 

(a) in which Molycorp merges or amalgamates with, or in which all or
substantially all of the then outstanding Molycorp Shares are acquired by, one
or more other corporations to which Molycorp is, immediately before such
merger, amalgamation or acquisition, "related" within the meaning of the
_Income Tax Act_ (Canada) (otherwise than by virtue of a right referred to in
paragraph 251(5)(b) thereof);

 



 

(b) which does not result in an acceleration of the Redemption Date in
accordance with paragraph (ii) of that definition; and

 



 

(c) in which all or substantially all of the then outstanding Molycorp Shares
are converted into or exchanged for shares or rights to receive such shares
(the " **Other Shares** ") of another corporation (the " **Other Corporation**
") that, immediately after such Molycorp Control Transaction, owns or
controls, directly or indirectly, Molycorp,

 



 

then, (i) all references herein to "Molycorp" shall thereafter be and be
deemed to be references to "Other Corporation" and all references herein to
"Molycorp Shares" shall thereafter be and be deemed to be references to "Other
Shares" (with appropriate adjustments, if any, as are required to result in a
holder of Exchangeable Shares on the exchange, redemption or retraction of
