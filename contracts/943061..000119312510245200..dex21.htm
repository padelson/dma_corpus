prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Restricted Stock)
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and shall automatically be converted into the
right to receive (i) the Per Share Initial Merger Consideration and (ii) any
amounts required to be paid with respect to such share to the former holder
thereof in accordance with the terms of _Section 8.3_ and the Escrow
Agreement, if, as and when such payments are required to be made. The amount
of cash each Company Stockholder is entitled to receive for the shares of
Company Common Stock held by such Company Stockholder as of immediately before
the Effective Time shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after
aggregating cash amounts for all shares of Company Common Stock held by such
Company Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties hereto or any
holder thereof, each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
shall automatically be converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares of
common stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation. 

(c) _Dissenters  Rights_. " _Dissenting Shares_ " means any shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who has demanded properly in writing appraisal for such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with _Section 262_ of Delaware
Law.

(i) Subject to clause (ii) of this  _Section 1.8(c)_, notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be
converted as provided in _Section 1.8(a)_, but the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by Delaware Law.

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (i) of this  _Section 1.8(c)_,
if any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal of such
holders shares of Company Common Stock under Delaware Law effectively
withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders
right to appraisal, then as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such
event, whichever later occurs, such holders shares of Company Common Stock
shall automatically be converted into the right to receive the
consideration set forth in _Section 1.8(a)_ upon surrender of the Company
Certificates representing such Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section
1.10_.

(iii) The Company shall give Parent (x) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal or payment of the fair value of any shares of Company Common
Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served on the

Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and all shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and shall
not be taken into account for purposes of any amounts payable to the Company
Holders hereunder.

 

Section 1.9 _Company Options and Company Restricted Stock_.

 

(a) _Company Options_. Subject to consummation of the Merger, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option that is
unexpired and unexercised, whether or not vested or exercisable prior to or as
a result of the consummation of the Merger, shall be accelerated in full so
that each such Company Option becomes fully vested and exercisable. Subject
to consummation of the Merger, at the Effective Time, each Company Option
outstanding shall be cancelled and each such Company Stock Option that has a
per share exercise price lower than the Per Share Merger Consideration shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive (i) an amount in cash
equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
would have been issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option
immediately before the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the excess of the Per
Share Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price for such Company
Stock Option, subject to any setoff, deduction or withholding contemplated in
this Agreement and (ii) any amounts required to be paid with respect to such
share to the former holder thereof in accordance with the terms of _Section
8.3_ and the Escrow Agreement, if, as and when such payments are required to
be made. As of the Effective Time, the Company Options shall terminate and
cease to be outstanding.

(b) _Company Restricted Stock_. Subject to consummation of the Merger, at the
Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock award that is unvested and
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive (i) an amount in cash
equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Restricted Stock award immediately prior to the
Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject
to any setoff, deduction or withholding contemplated in this Agreement and
(ii) any amounts required to be paid with respect to such share to the former
holder thereof in accordance with the terms of _Section 8.3_ and the Escrow
Agreement, if, as and when such payments are required to be made. As of the
Effective Time, the Company Restricted Stock awards shall terminate and cease
to be outstanding.

cause the Company Options and Company Restricted Stock to be treated as set

governing all Company Options and Company Restricted Stock have been made
available to Parent.

 

Section 1.10 _Surrender of Certificates and Payment_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Bank of New York (or its successor in interest or other
institution selected by Parent with the reasonable consent of the Company)
shall act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") in the Merger.

(b) _Parent to Provide Cash_. Contemporaneously with the filing of the
Certificate of Merger pursuant to _Section 1.3_, Parent shall deliver to the
Paying Agent for exchange and payment in accordance with this _ARTICLE I_ ,
through such reasonable procedures as Parent may adopt, an aggregate amount of
cash sufficient to make the payments required by _Section 1.8(a)_;
_provided,_ that in the case of payments to employees or former employees of
the Company for which Tax withholding is required, Parent may elect to make
such payments on the first reasonably practicable payroll date after the
Closing through the Companys or Parents payroll processing service or system
in lieu of making such payments through the Paying Agent.

 



5 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing,
Parent shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates representing Company Common Stock (each such certificate, a "
_Company Certificate_ ") a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit A and instructions to the letter of transmittal for use in
effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for the merger
consideration. After the Effective Time and upon surrender of all Company
Certificates held by a Company Holder for cancellation to the Paying Agent or
to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, the Company Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled and, subject to _Section 1.14_, the holder of such
Company Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
applicable payments pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_; provided that in the event
a Company Holder delivers Company Certificates held by such Company Holder for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, by the
Closing, Parent shall use its commercial reasonable efforts to cause the
Paying Agent to make payment by wire transfer to such Company Holder on the
Closing Date or on the next succeeding Business Day of the applicable amounts
pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Company
Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented Company Common
Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all purposes, to
evidence solely the right to receive the applicable payments pursuant to
_Section 1.8(a)_. 

(d) _Conversion Schedule_. Attached as _Schedule 1.10(d)_ is a schedule (the "
_Preliminary Conversion Schedule_ ") showing (i) for each Company Holder: (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock held as of the date hereof, (B)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each Company Option
and Company Restricted Stock award held as of the date hereof, and, if
applicable, the exercise price per share, the exercise or vesting schedules
thereof, and whether such Company Holder is an employee of the Company, (C) a

respect of shares of Company Common Stock, (II) pursuant to _Section 1.9(a)_
in respect of Company Options and (III) pursuant to _Section 1.9(b)_ in

Proportionate Indemnification Share of the Escrow Amount (assuming no claims
for Damages pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_ ) and the Stockholders Agent
Reimbursement Escrow Amount and (ii) the Companys good faith itemized
estimates as if the Closing were to occur on December 31, 2010 of (A) the
Indebtedness Adjustment, (B) the aggregate amount of the Change of Control
and Severance Payments and (C) the unpaid Company Transaction Expenses
incurred up to and including the date of this Agreement. No later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date, the Company shall deliver
to Parent a draft of a schedule (the " _Final Conversion Schedule_ ") showing
for each Company Holder, as of the expected Closing Date: (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock held, (ii) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to each Company Option and Company Restricted Stock award
held, if applicable, the exercise price per share, and whether such Company
Holder is an employee or former employee of the Company, (iii) a calculation
of the amount payable to such Company Holder on the Effective Date (A)
pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ in respect of shares of Company Common Stock,
(B) pursuant to _Section 1.9(a)_ in respect of Company Options and (C)
pursuant to _Section 1.9(b)_ in respect of Company Restricted Stock, (iv)
such Company Holders Proportionate Indemnification Share of the Escrow Amount
(assuming no claims for Damages pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_ ) and the
Stockholders Agent Reimbursement Escrow Amount and (v) the aggregate Change
of Control and Severance Payments payable to such Company Holder. The Company
shall deliver the Final Conversion Schedule to Parent at Closing, together
with a certification by an officer of the Company that the Final Conversion
Schedule correctly reflects the calculations contained therein as required to
be made pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any merger consideration is to be distributed
to a name other than that in which the Company Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Company Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of payment in cash to any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



6 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
1.10_, none of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto
shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Legal Requirements.

(g) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any merger consideration made available
to the Paying Agent and not exchanged for Company Certificates in accordance
with this _Section 1.10_ within six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
be redelivered or repaid by the Paying Agent to Parent, after which time any
holder of Company Certificates who has not theretofore delivered or
surrendered such Company Certificates to the Paying Agent, subject to
applicable Legal Requirements, shall look as a general creditor only to
Parent for payment of the merger consideration. If any Company Certificates
are not surrendered prior to the earlier of the second anniversary of the
Effective Time and such time as the unclaimed merger consideration payable in
exchange therefor would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority, such unclaimed merger consideration shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

Section 1.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; No
Interest_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of any shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company
Certificates evidencing ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein
or by applicable Legal Requirements. If, after the Effective Time, Company
Certificates are presented to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE
I_. Payments due under this _ARTICLE I_ shall be made without interest.

Section 1.12  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall
cause to be paid in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, such payment of the
merger consideration as may be required pursuant to this _ARTICLE I_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Company Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 1.13 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and
directors of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation are
fully authorized in the name of their respective entities or otherwise to
take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such
action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

 

Section 1.14 _Tax Withholding_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Purchase Price payable hereunder,
or other payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, the amounts required to be deducted and withheld under the Code,
or any provision of any U.S. federal, state or local or any non-U.S. Tax law.
Any amounts so withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such
deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such holder in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made.

Section 1.15 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and such other Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) imposed on any Company Holder or other Person entitled to receive
merger consideration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be borne
and paid by such Company Holder or Person.

(ii) the exercise or vesting schedule, (iii) the exercise price per share,
(iv) the date of grant, (v) the expiration date, (vi) the Company Restricted
Stock or Company Options that have been exercised, if applicable, or that have
expired or been terminated, (vii) whether the Company Option is an incentive
stock option (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) or a nonqualified stock
option, (viii) whether such Company Option or Company Restricted Stock award
is held by a Person who is not an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Each grant of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock was
validly issued and properly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company
(or a duly authorized committee or subcommittee thereof) in compliance with
all applicable Legal Requirements and recorded on the Financial Statements in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied, and no such grants involved any
"back dating," "forward dating" or similar practices with respect to the
effective date of grant. No Company Option has an exercise price that has been
or may be less than the fair market value of the Company Common Stock as of
the date such Company Option was granted or has any feature for the deferral
of compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income until the
later of exercise or disposition of such option, in each case, determined in
accordance with the regulations and guidance under Code Section 409A.
The Company has provided to Parent prior

valuation reports with respect to the valuation of the fair market value of
Company Common Stock since January 1, 2005, for purposes of determining the
exercise price of Company Options. As of the Effective Time, no holder or
former holder of Company Options or Company Restricted Stock will have any
right to receive, except as provided in _ARTICLE I_ , shares of capital stock
or other securities of Parent or any cash payment from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in each case in respect of Company Options or Company Restricted
Stock.

complete and correct list of all Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement. Except (x) as set forth in

no Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries contains any restriction
upon (i) the prepayment of any of such Indebtedness, (ii) the incurrence of
Indebtedness by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) the ability
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant any Lien on its properties

correct.

(a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the other agreements set forth in the exhibits
hereto (collectively, the " _Ancillary Agreements_ ") to which the Company is
a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which the Company is a party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company (other than the adoption
of this Agreement and the Merger by the requisite Company Stockholders which
adoption will occur immediately following the execution of this Agreement by
the Company) and no other corporate action on the part of the Company is
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which the Company is a party have
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitute the valid and
binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with their terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be
limited by the effect, if any, of (i) any applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other Legal Requirements affecting
the enforcement of creditors rights generally, and (ii) general principles of
equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity.

(b) Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby will conflict with, or result in any breach or violation
of, default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), or give
rise to any right of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration,
or any obligation or loss of any benefit under (i) any provision of the
Company Certificate of Incorporation or the Company Bylaws, or the
governing documents of any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) assuming that all
consents, waivers and approvals set forth in _Section 2.20_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule are duly obtained, any Contract to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their respective
properties or assets are bound (other than rights of termination or
cancellation under any such Contract that may be canceled without cause by the
other party thereto without penalty to such party upon notice of 90 days or
less) or (iii) subject to the exceptions set forth in the sentence that
immediately follows, any Legal Requirement applicable to the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, any of the Hospital Joint Ventures, any of the Managed
Practices, or any of their respective properties or assets; except in the case
of clauses (ii) and (iii), for such breaches, violations, defaults,
obligations or losses, which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or to prevent or materially alter or delay the Companys ability
to consummate the Merger. Except for (i) the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger and the related certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with the requirements of Delaware Law and
(ii) such filings as may be required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") and any applicable
foreign antitrust law, no notice to, filing with, and no Permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority ("
_Governmental Authorization_ ") is necessary for the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



10 Section 2.4  _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed or furnished, as applicable,
on a timely basis, all forms, statements, certifications, reports and
documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") pursuant to the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act since January 1, 2008 (the forms, statements, certifications,
reports and documents filed or furnished since January 1, 2008 and those filed
or furnished subsequent to the date hereof, including any amendments thereto,
the " _Company Reports_ "). Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its
filing or being furnished complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will
comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Securities Act_ ") and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the " _Exchange Act_ ") and any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of their respective dates
(or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment),
the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with or furnished
to the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. The Company has
made available to Parent copies of all material correspondence between the
SEC and the Company since January 1, 2008. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no material outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC
staff with respect to the Company Reports. Except for US Oncology, Inc., none
of the Companys Subsidiaries is or has been required to file any form, report
or other document with the SEC or any securities exchange or quotation
service.

 

(b) Each of the Financial Statements (including in all cases the notes and
schedules thereto, if any) (i) was prepared in accordance with the books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) was prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods covered thereby; and
(iii) presents fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at such dates and the results
of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for such periods on a consolidated basis, subject to normal year-
end adjustments, none of which would be material, individually or in the
aggregate, and the absence of notes. Since January 1, 2010, there has been no
change in any accounting policies, principles, methods or practices, including
any change with respect to reserves (whether for bad debts, contingent
liabilities or otherwise), of the Company. Since January 1, 2005, no audit
firm has ever declined or indicated its inability to issue an opinion with
respect to any financial statements of the Company.

(c) Since January 1, 2008, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has had in
place "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) reasonably designed and
maintained to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
reports that it files or submits to the SEC under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Companys or such Subsidiarys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of the Company or such Subsidiary required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries (i) make and
keep accurate books and records that fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of assets of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may
be, and (ii) maintain internal accounting controls which provide reasonable
assurance that (a) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of their respective financial statements in conformity with GAAP,
(b) receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with general or
specific authorizations of management and directors of the Company or such
Subsidiary, (c) access to their respective assets is permitted only in
accordance with general or specific authorizations of management and directors
of the Company or such Subsidiary and (d) the reported accounting for their
respective assets and liabilities is compared with existing assets and
liabilities at reasonable intervals.

(d) The items marked with an asterisk on _Section 2.4(d)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule are true and correct.

Section 2.5 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since the Interim Balance Sheet
Date, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has (i) conducted its business
in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, (ii) has not suffered
any Company Material Adverse Effect and no event has occurred that could
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and (iii) has
not taken any action that would be prohibited by _Section 4.2_ of this
Agreement, if taken after the date hereof.

 



11 Section 2.6  _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any material liabilities (whether contingent or
absolute, direct or indirect, known or unknown to the Company or matured or
unmatured or otherwise) of a type required to be reflected or reserved for on
a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP other than (i) liabilities
and obligations accrued or reserved against in the Interim Balance Sheet, (ii)
liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since the Interim Balance Sheet Date, (iii)
performance obligations pursuant to the terms of the Material Contracts and
(iv) liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. There are no off balance sheet arrangements
(as such term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K of the
Securities Act) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
otherwise involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

States or under the laws of any state thereof or any other jurisdiction
(foreign or domestic) under which such payment, contribution or gift was made
that, individually or in the aggregate, would be material to the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of the Hospital Joint Ventures.

(e) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of the Hospital Joint

(g) The Company, its Subsidiaries and the Hospital Joint Ventures have made
all notifications, registrations, certifications and filings with all
Governmental Authorities, necessary or advisable for the operation of its
business as currently conducted, except such notifications, registrations,
certifications and filings the absence of which would not be material,
individually or in the aggregate, to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of the Hospital Joint Ventures. Except as set forth in  _Section
2.7(g)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Hospital Joint Ventures owns, holds or possesses, and
lawfully uses, in the operation of its business all material Permits that
are necessary for it to conduct its business as now conducted (each, a "

Company Authorizations and all other Company Authorizations that are material
to the conduct of the business of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of the Hospital Joint Ventures (collectively, the " _Material Company

splitting", or similar laws governing professional activities and
relationships by reason of any agreement between the Company or any Subsidiary

applicable law which would require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of the Hospital Joint Ventures to obtain any Permits other than the

businesses as presently conducted. None of the Material Company Authorizations
shall be adversely affected as a result of the Companys execution and
delivery of, or the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, any
related document to which it is a party, or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. None of the Company, any of its

material respects with applicable Legal Requirements (including ERISA and the
Code). Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates is subject to any
liability or penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I
of ERISA with respect to any of the Company Employee Plans. With respect to
each Company Employee Plan, no "reportable event" within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the thirty (30) day
notice requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of
ERISA) nor any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 or ERISA has
occurred. Each Company Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise
discontinued after the Closing Date in accordance with its terms, without
liability to Parent (other than ordinary administrative expenses typically
incurred in a termination event). With respect to each Company Employee
Plan subject to ERISA as either an employee pension plan within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an employee welfare benefit plan within the
meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite governmental
reports, which were true and correct as of the date filed.

(f) No suit, administrative proceeding, action or other litigation has been
brought, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is threatened, against or with
respect to any such Company Employee Plan, including any Audit or inquiry by
the IRS, the United States Department of Labor or any other local Tax
Authority other than routine undisputed claims for benefits in the ordinary
course.

 

(g) Each Company Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Code Section 409A(d)(1)) (i) has been maintained and
operated since January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance with Code Section 409A
and all applicable IRS guidance promulgated thereunder so as to avoid any Tax,
penalty or interest under Code Section 409A and, as to any such plan in
existence prior to January 1, 2005, has not been "materially modified" (within
the meaning of IRS Notice 2005-1) at any time after October 2, 2004, and (ii)
since January 1, 2009, has been in documentary and operational compliance
with Section 409A of the Code and all applicable IRS guidance promulgated
thereunder.

(h) Except as set forth in _Section 2.15(h)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any
current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay, termination pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment or benefit under any Company Employee Plan,
(ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of benefits, or increase the
amount of compensation, due to any such employee, officer, director or
consultant under any Company Employee Plan, (iii) result in any
forgiveness of Indebtedness, trigger any funding obligation under any Company
Employee Plan or impose any restrictions or limitations on the Companys
rights to administer, amend or terminate any Company Employee Plan or (iv)
result in any payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) to any "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G.1) that could reasonably be construed,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, to constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No
director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is entitled to receive any gross-up or additional payment by
reason of the tax required by Section 409A or 4999 of the Code being imposed
on such person. Other than the Change of Control and Severance Payments set
forth on _Section 2.15(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no
change of control, severance, transaction bonus or other similar payment
rights of any officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that will be triggered, accelerated or become payable upon the
consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

(i) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company or any ERISA Affiliates relating to,
or change in participation or coverage under, any Company Employee Plan which
would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Company Employee
Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to that Company Employee
Plan for the most recent fiscal year included in the Financial Statements.

(j) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates maintains, sponsors, participates in or contributes to, nor
has it ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or
contributed to, any pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA)
which is subject to Section 302 of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code.

 



24 (k) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates is a party to, or has made any contribution to or otherwise
incurred any obligation to contribute to, any "multi employer plan" as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

(l) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has or could have any
liability with respect to any current or former employee, director or
consultant in respect of post-retirement health, medical, life insurance or
other benefits, except as required by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(m) No amounts paid by any Company Employee Plan would fail to be deductible
under Sections 404 or 404A of the Code.

 

(n) Each individual who renders or has rendered services to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and who is or has been classified by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as having the status of an independent contractor,
consultant or other status other than employee for any purpose is, and has at
all times been, properly characterized as such to an extent that would
not reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification of any Company
Employee Plan or in any liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(o) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has used the services or workers provided by third party contract
labor suppliers, temporary employees, "leased employees" (as that term is
defined in Section 414(n) of the Code), or individuals who have provided
services as independent contractors to an extent that reasonably could be
expected to result in the disqualification of any Company Employee Plan or
the imposition of penalties or excise taxes with respect to any Company
Employee Plan.

(p) The Company has made available to Parent accurate and complete copies of
the Company Stock Plans and all forms of award agreements evidencing awards
granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans as of the date hereof. No material
changes have been made to any such forms in connection with any award. No
outstanding stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock
appreciation rights, phantom stock, profit participation, performance shares
or other equity-based awards associated with shares of Company Common Stock
have been issued or are outstanding other than pursuant to the Company Stock
Plans and other than as set forth in _Section 2.15(p)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT_

Parent represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

Section 3.1  _Organization, Standing and Power_. Parent is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state
of Delaware. Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has the corporate power to own its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted and is duly qualified to do business and, in
jurisdictions where such concept is recognized, is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in

 



31  which the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub are
not in violation of any of the provisions of their respective articles of
incorporation, certificate of incorporation or bylaws, except as would not
have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 3.2 _Authority_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a
party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part
of Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, and no other corporate action on
the part of Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement
to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party have been duly executed and delivered
by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, and constitute the valid and
binding obligations of Parent or Merger Sub enforceable against Parent or
Merger Sub in accordance with their terms, except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by the effect, if any, of (i) any applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other Legal Requirements
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, and (ii) general
principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding at law or in equity. Neither the execution and delivery by
Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to which it
is a party, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby will conflict with, or result in any breach or violation of, or
default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) or give rise
to a right of termination, cancellation or obligation or loss of any benefit
under (i) any provision of the articles of incorporation, certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub, or (ii) any Legal Requirement
applicable to either Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
properties or assets, except, in the case of clause (iii) above, any such
conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults, rights or losses, which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially and adversely delay
the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Except for (i) the filing and recordation of the Certificate
of Merger and the related certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with the requirements of Delaware Law and (ii) such
filings as may be required under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign
antitrust law, no notice to, filing with, and no permit, authorization,
consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority, or any private third party
is necessary for the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 3.3  _Interim Operations of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub was formed by
Parent solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted
its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Sub has no
liabilities and, except for a subscription agreement pursuant to which all of
its authorized capital stock was issued to Parent, is not a party to any
agreement other than this Agreement, the agreements contemplated herein and
agreements with respect to the appointment of registered agents and similar
matters.

 

Section 3.4 _Litigation_. There is no private or governmental action, lawsuit
or other legal proceeding pending (or, to the knowledge of Parent, being
threatened) against Parent or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or any of their respective officers or directors (in their
capacities as such) that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially and adversely delay the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 3.5 _Brokers  and Finders Fees_. Parent has not incurred, nor will
it incur, directly or indirectly, any liability for brokerage or finders
fees or agents commissions or investment bankers fees or any similar charges
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby for
which the Company or any Company Holder shall have any liability.

Section 3.6 _Available Funds_. Parent will have at the Effective Time
sufficient cash resources to enable it to pay the Purchase Price pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



32 Section 3.7 _No Outside Reliance_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that neither
the Company nor any of its Affiliates, agents or representatives is making any
representation or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those
expressly given in _ARTICLE II_ , the Ancillary Agreements and any certificate
or letter of transmittal delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any

to the Company, the Company Holders or any other Person for any costs, claims,
liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking to obtain such
consents, waivers and approvals under subsection (iii) hereof.

(d) _Financing Cooperation_. In furtherance of the foregoing but without
limiting the generality of  _Section 5.4(c)_, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees and
agents to, reasonably cooperate with Parent in connection with obtaining any
financing Parent deems necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby (the " _Financing_ "), including by (i) providing direct contact
between prospective lenders and the officers and directors of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) providing assistance in preparation of confidential
information memoranda, prospectuses and other materials to be used in
connection with the Financing, (iii) providing assistance in the preparation
for, and participating in, meetings, due diligence sessions, road shows and
similar presentations to and with, among others, prospective lenders,
investors and rating agencies, (iv) providing any financial information
necessary for the satisfaction of the obligations and conditions set forth
in any commitment letters or similar agreements and (v) undertaking such
other actions, all as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation
hereunder to execute any binding commitment or obligation in connection with
Parents efforts to obtain any financing.

(e) _No Divestiture_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require
Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to any Action of
Divestiture. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, take or agree to take any Action of Divestiture. For purposes of this
Agreement, an " _Action of Divestiture_ " means (i) any license, sale or other
disposition or holding separate (through establishment of a trust or
otherwise) of any shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or
properties of Parent, its Subsidiaries or affiliates, or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) the imposition of any limitation on the ability of
Parent, its Subsidiaries or affiliates, or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses or own any capital stock
or assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of
their respective businesses and, in the case of Parent, the businesses of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) the imposition of any
impediment on Parent, its Subsidiaries or affiliates, or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries under any statute, rule, regulation, executive order,
decree, order or other legal restraint governing competition, monopolies or
restrictive trade practices.

(f) _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 



39 Section 5.5  _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Company shall, on or prior to the
Closing Date, provide Parent with a properly executed Foreign Investment and
Real Property Tax Act of 1980 notification letter (the " _FIRPTA Certificate_
"), substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto, which states
that shares of capital stock of the Company do not constitute "United States
real property interests" under Section 897(c) of the Code, for purposes
of satisfying Parents obligations under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(c)(3). In addition, simultaneously with delivery of such FIRPTA
Certificate, the Company shall have provided to Parent, as agent for the
Company, a form of notice to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2) and in the customary form along with
written authorization for Parent to deliver such notice form to the IRS on
behalf of the Company upon the Closing of the Merger, all in substantially
the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto.

Section 5.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall: (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who served as a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the extent provided
for under the terms and conditions of the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or the Company Bylaws (each as in effect as of the date hereof),
in connection with any Claim (as defined below) and any judgments, damages,
losses, claims, liabilities, fines (including excise taxes), penalties and
amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments,
damages, losses, claims, liabilities, fines, penalties or amounts paid in
settlement) resulting therefrom. The indemnification obligations of the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to this _Section 5.6(a)_ shall extend to acts
or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating
thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and any Claim relating thereto) and all
rights to indemnification conferred hereunder shall continue as to an
individual who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and shall inure to the benefit of
such individuals heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As
used in this _Section 5.6(a)_, the term " _Claim_ " means any threatened,
asserted, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, or any
inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by the Company, any Governmental
Authority or any other party, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute
resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to
such Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director, officer, trustee,
employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any
employee benefit plan maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the
Effective Time and any other Person at the request the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall keep
in full force and effect, and comply with the terms and conditions of, any
agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement between or among the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party and listed in
_Section 2.19_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule providing for the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party.

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i)
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, assume all of
the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 5.6_.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, together
with any insurance policies held by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries on behalf of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors and officers, shall be the indemnitor of first resort
with respect to any Claim, responsible for all indemnification and advancement
of expenses contemplated by this _Section 5.6_ without regard to any right to
indemnification or advancement of expenses that any Indemnified Party may
have from any direct or indirect stockholder of the Company (or any affiliate
of such stockholder), and without right to seek subrogation, indemnity or
contribution.

 



40 (e) The provisions of this _Section 5.6_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger for a period of six (6) years and (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.6_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnified Party under this _Section 5.6_ without the consent of such
affected Indemnified Party.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company
may, prior to or in connection with the Closing, purchase a "tail" policy
under the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy (the "
_Tail Policy_ "), with the cost of such Tail Policy, to the extent unpaid as
of the Closing, included in the Company Transaction Expenses.

Section 5.7 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company Board shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate the effects
of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.8 _Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as among Parent and the Stockholders Agent for
certain Tax matters:

(a) _Pre-Closing Tax Period and Straddle Period Tax Returns_. Parent shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
for the Company and its Subsidiaries for any taxable year or period that ends
on or before the Closing Date that are due (including extensions) after the
Closing Date and for any Straddle Period in a manner that is consistent with
the past practices, procedures and accounting methods of the Company and its
Subsidiaries except to the extent such past practices, procedures and
accounting methods are determined not to be permissible under the applicable
Legal Requirements. Parent shall (A) submit such Tax Returns to the
Stockholders Agent for review and comment at least twenty (20) days prior to
their filing and (B) make any timely comments requested by the Stockholders
Agent in good faith, provided such comments are (i) consistent with past
practice and applicable Legal Requirements, and (ii) could not reasonably be
expected to materially adversely impact the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or Parent (or any Affiliate) in any taxable year or period beginning after the
Closing Date. Parent shall receive a disbursement from the Escrow Fund, at
least five (5) days before the due date of the applicable Tax Return, in an
amount equal to the Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax Return to the
extent such Taxes are due with respect to the Tax liability of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries for taxable years ending on or before the
Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle Period ending on (and including)
the Closing Date. In the event that Parent and the Stockholders Agent are
unable to agree on any position(s) taken on any Tax Return described in this 
_Section 5.8(a)_ prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, Parent and
the Stockholders Agent shall promptly submit such Tax Return to the Tax
Arbitrator for resolution in accordance with the procedures described in 
_Section 5.8(d)_; _provided, however_ , that if the Tax Arbitrator is unable
to resolve such dispute prior to the filing of such Tax Return, Parent shall
be entitled to receive a disbursement from the Escrow Fund or, if after
the release date of the Escrow Fund, payment from the Indemnifying Persons in
accordance with this _Section 5.8(a)_ and _ARTICLE VIII_ for the amount of
Taxes for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion
of any Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date shown as
due and payable on the Tax Return originally submitted to the Stockholders
Agent by Parent; _provided further, however_ , that if the Tax Arbitrator
resolves such dispute in favor of the Stockholders Agent, Parent shall
prepare and file an amended Tax Return reflecting the position of the Tax
Arbitrator with respect to the disputed item or items and, within five (5)
days of receipt of any refund or credit of Taxes attributable to such
disputed item or items, pay to the Escrow Fund or, if after the release date
of the Escrow Fund, the Indemnifying Persons, the amount of such refund or
credit plus any interest received with respect thereto from the applicable
Governmental Authority (net of any Taxes imposed on such refund amount,
including interest). In the event that any such Tax refund is subsequently
reduced as a result of any adjustment required by any Governmental Authority,
Parent shall be entitled to receive a disbursement from the Escrow Fund or
payment from the Indemnifying Persons in accordance with this _Section
5.8(a)_ for the amount of such reduction. Taxes shall be apportioned as
provided in  _Section 5.8(c)_.

 



41 (b) _Tax Contests_. After the Closing Date, Parent shall notify the
Stockholders Agent within ten (10) days of the commencement of any notice of
Tax deficiency, proposed Tax adjustment, Tax assessment, Tax audit, Tax
examination or other administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or
other claim with respect to Taxes (a " _Tax Claim_ ") affecting the Taxes of
or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if determined
adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time would be grounds for a
claim for indemnity pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ hereof; _provided, however_
, that a failure by Parent to provide notice of a Tax Claim within such ten
(10) day period shall not entitle the Indemnifying Persons to reduce the
amount of the liability required to be paid pursuant to the Tax Indemnity
under _Section 8.2(a)_ unless such failure results in a material detriment to
the Indemnifying Persons, in which case the amount the Indemnifying Persons
are required to pay with respect to such liability shall only be reduced by
the amount of such detriment. Thereafter, Parent shall deliver to the
Stockholders Agent, as promptly as possible but in no event later than ten
(10) days after Parents receipt thereof, copies of all relevant notices and
documents (including court papers) received by Parent. In the case of any Tax
Claim relating to any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date that,
if determined adversely to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be
grounds for a claim for indemnity pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ hereof, the
Stockholders Agent (at its sole cost and expense) shall have the right
to control the conduct of such Tax Claim and shall have the right to settle
such Tax Claim; _provided, however_ , (i) that Parent may fully participate in
the dispute of such Tax Claim, (ii) the Stockholders Agent shall not
settle, compromise or dispose of any Tax Claim in a manner that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, Parent or its affiliates after the Closing Date, (iii) the
Stockholders Agent shall keep Parent timely informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of any such Tax Claim and (iv) the
Stockholders Agent shall not settle, compromise or dispose of any Tax Claim
without the consent of the Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. In the case of any Tax Claim relating to the Taxes of any Straddle
Period, Parent and the Stockholders Agent may each participate, at their own
expense, in the audit or proceeding, and the audit or proceeding shall
be controlled by Parent or the Stockholders Agent, whichever would bear the
burden of the greatest portion of the adjustment; _provided, however_ , that
the party controlling the Straddle Period Tax Claim (i) shall not settle such
audit or proceeding without the consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld and (ii) shall keep the other party timely
informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any such Tax
Claim.

 

(c) Where it is necessary for purposes of this Agreement to apportion the
Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to the assets
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, such
liability shall be apportioned between the period deemed to end at the close
of the Closing Date, and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the
day following the Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of the
books, except that Taxes (such as real or personal property Taxes) imposed on
a periodic basis shall be allocated on a daily basis.

 

(d) _Cooperation_. Parent and the Stockholders Agent shall cooperate fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, examination, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding. Each of Parent and the Stockholders Agent agrees, upon request,
to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Tax Authority as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce
or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to,
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder).

 

(e) _Dispute Resolution_. Any dispute, controversy, or claim between Parent,
on the one hand, and the Stockholders Agent, on the other hand, arising out
of or relating to the provisions of this Agreement that relates to Taxes or
any Tax Returns that cannot be resolved by negotiations between Parent and the
Stockholders Agent shall be submitted to a senior tax partner in a mutually
agreeable nationally recognized accounting firm for resolution (" _Tax
Arbitrator_ "). Parent and Stockholders Agent shall instruct the Tax
Arbitrator to decide any matter that would be expected to result in an
indemnification obligation under _Section 8.2(a)_ that comes before such Tax
Arbitrator in a manner that is consistent with past practices, procedures and
accounting methods of the Company and its Subsidiaries except to the extent
such past practices, procedures and accounting methods are determined not to
be permissible under the applicable Legal Requirements. The resolution reached
by the Tax Arbitrator shall be binding on the Company, its Subsidiaries, the
Stockholders Agent, Parent and their respective affiliates, and may be
entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. The expenses of the Tax
Arbitrator shall be borne by Parent and the Stockholders Agent in such
proportions as the Tax Arbitrator considers to be fair and reasonable in all
circumstances to resolve the dispute.

 



42 Section 5.9  _Parachute Payment Waivers_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent, prior to the initiation of
the requisite stockholder approval procedure under _Section 5.10_, a
parachute payment waiver, in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit D_ (the " _Parachute Payment Waiver_ "), from each person who the
Company reasonably believes is, with respect to the Company, and/or any ERISA
Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined
immediately before the initiation of the requisite stockholder approval
procedure under  _Section 5.10_ and who might otherwise have, receive or
have the right or entitlement to receive a parachute payment under Section
280G of the Code as a result of (a) the accelerated vesting of stock options
or unvested property in connection with the Merger and/or the termination of
employment or service with the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent
before, upon or following the Merger, (b) any severance payments, bonus
payments or other benefits or payments in connection with the Merger and/or
the termination of employment or service with the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent before, upon or following the Merger and/or (c) the
receipt of any Company Options or Company Common Stock within the 12-month
period ending on the date the Effective Time occurs, pursuant to which such
person shall agree to waive any and all right or entitlement to the
accelerated vesting, payments, benefits options and stock referred to in
clauses (a), (b) and (c) to the extent the value thereof exceeds 2.99 times
such persons base amount determined in accordance with Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the requisite
stockholder approval of such accelerated vesting, payments, benefits, options
and stock is obtained pursuant to _Section 5.10_.

 

Section 5.10 _280G Stockholder Approval_. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval by such number of
stockholders of the Company as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code so as to render the parachute payment provisions of
Section 280G of the Code inapplicable to any and all accelerated
vesting payments, benefits, options and/or stock provided pursuant to the
agreements, contracts or arrangements that might otherwise result, separately
or in the aggregate, in the payment of any amount and/or the provision of any
benefit that would not be deductible by reason of section 280G of the Code,
with such stockholder vote to be obtained in a manner which satisfied all
applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

Section 5.11 _Treatment of Certain Indebtedness_.

(a) On or prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Closing, the
Company shall obtain a payoff letter from the agent under that certain Credit
Agreement, dated as of August 26, 2009, among the Company, US Oncology, Inc.,
the Lenders party thereto, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc.
and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agents, and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. as Documentation Agent (the " _Company Credit Agreement_ "), in customary
form reasonably acceptable to Parent, with respect to the Indebtedness of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under such Company Credit Agreement which payoff

satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage
costs or similar obligations related to such Indebtedness as of the Closing
Date (the " _Payoff Amount_ "), (ii) indicate the total face amount of
Company LCs and (iii) state that all liens in connection therewith relating to
the assets of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall be, upon the
payment of the Payoff Amount on the Closing Date and the replacement of the
Company LCs or the issuance of Parent LCs, as provided below, released (the
payoff letter described in this sentence being referred to as the " _Payoff
Letter_ "). The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver
all notices and take all other actions reasonably requested by Parent, or
otherwise necessary, to facilitate (i) the termination of commitments under
the Company Credit Agreement, the repayment in full of all obligations then
outstanding thereunder and the release of all liens in connection therewith on
the Closing Date and (ii)(x) the replacement of all letters of credit issued
for the account of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Company
Credit Agreement (the " _Company LCs_ ") with letters of credit issued and

it is impracticable to replace the Company LCs, the issuance to the letter of
credit issuer under the Company Credit Agreement of "back to back" letters of
credit under Parents credit facilities, in a face amount equal to the face
amount of the Company LCs, which letters of credit provided by Parent shall
be for the sole purpose of reimbursing the letter of credit issuer under the
Company Credit Agreement for drawings made on the Company LCs, plus accrued
interest and fees thereon, effective as of the Closing Date (such

 



43  termination, repayment, release and replacement or issuance, the " _Credit
Agreement Termination_ "). Concurrently with the Closing, Parent shall pay to
the administrative agent under the Company Credit Agreement all amounts
required pursuant to the terms of the Company Credit Agreement and specified
in the Payoff Letter to effect the Credit Agreement Termination.

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause US Oncology, Inc. to, (i) prepare
notices of redemption for all of the outstanding Floating Rate Notes in the
case of the Company, and 9.125% Notes and 10.75% Notes in the case of US

Floating Rate Notes Indenture (collectively, the " _Indentures_ "),
respectively, and pursuant to the related provisions of each of the Redeemed
Notes, (ii) cause each Trustee (as defined in each of the Indentures) to
agree to proceed with the redemption of the Redeemed Notes on notice of 30
days (or 31 days in the case of the 10.75% Notes) before the redemption date
and provide such notice on the Closing Date immediately prior to the
Effective Time and take any such action as is necessary to cause each Trustee

certificates and opinions reasonably in advance of their delivery and (vi)
take all other actions and prepare all other documents as may be necessary or
appropriate to issue an irrevocable notice of redemption on the Closing Date
for each of the Redeemed Notes providing for the redemption 30 days (or 31
days in the case of the 10.75% Notes) after the Closing Date of all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of Redeemed Notes (together with all
interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs or similar
obligations related to the Redeemed Notes) pursuant to the requisite
provisions of the applicable Indentures. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Company shall not be required to cause a Trustee to send
any notice of redemption until the Company receives an officers certificate
from Parent that each condition to Parent and Merger Subs obligation to
consummate and affect the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby set
forth in _ARTICLE VI_ (other than _Section 6.3(l)_) have been satisfied and
that Parent and Merger Sub will do so subject only to satisfaction of the

Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements, the subject matter hereof and
thereof, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, shall be in
accordance with, and limited solely to indemnification under, the provisions
of this _ARTICLE VIII_. Without limiting the

 



48  generality of the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit
the rights of the Parent Indemnified Persons to seek or obtain injunctive
relief or any other equitable remedy to which such Parent Indemnified Person
is otherwise entitled. Any indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying
Persons pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ shall first be paid out from the Escrow
Fund to the extent available.

 

(c) Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to receive any portion of

(d) In determining the existence of a breach or the amount of any Damage, any
qualifications in the representations, warranties and covenants with respect

disregarded and will not have any effect with respect to the calculation of
the amount of any Damages attributable to a breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant of the Company set forth in this Agreement or in any of
the Ancillary Agreements, exhibits, schedules or certificates to, or delivered
in connection with this Agreement.

 

(e) The representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement (and claims for breach of a Representation Covenant related to such
representations and warranties) other than the Specified Representations (and
claims for breach of a Representation Covenant related to such Specified
Representations) shall survive until the date eighteen (18) months after
the Closing Date, and no claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ may be brought after such date with respect to such representations
and warranties (or such Representation Covenant). The Specified
Representations (and claims for breach of a Representation Covenant related
to such Specified Representations) shall survive until the date three (3)
years after the Closing Date and no claims for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_ may be brought after such date with respect to the
Specified Representations (or such Representation Covenant). In no case shall
the termination of the representations and warranties affect any claim for
misrepresentation or breach thereof if written notice of such
misrepresentation or breach is given to the Stockholders Agent (including
under _Section 8.4_ or _Section 8.9_) prior to such termination. No claims
for indemnification pursuant to _Sections 8.2(a)(ii)-(v) or (vii)_ may be

or after the day eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the " _Escrow

the Escrow Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that a portion of the Escrow
Fund which is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied or unresolved claims for
Damages specified in any Officers Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent

until such claims have been resolved.

Section 8.4 _Stockholders  Agent_.

Indemnifying Persons and to Parent. No bond shall be required of
the Stockholders Agent, and the Stockholders Agent shall receive no
compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or from the
Stockholders Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Indemnifying Persons. 

(b) The Stockholders Agent shall not be liable to any Company Holder for any
act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholders Agent while acting in good
faith. The Stockholders Agent shall be entitled to engage such counsel,
experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in
connection with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder
and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such
Persons. The Indemnifying Persons shall severally and pro rata, in accordance
with their respective Proportionate Indemnification Share, indemnify the
Stockholders Agent and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholders Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of his duties hereunder (the " _Agent Expenses_ "). The
Stockholders Agent shall be entitled to receive out of the Stockholders
Agent Reimbursement Escrow Amount such amounts as may be necessary to
reimburse the Stockholders Agent for any Agent Expenses. In addition,
following the termination of the Escrow Period, the Stockholders Agent shall
have the right to recover Agent Expenses from the Escrow Fund from any amount
that would otherwise be distributed to the Indemnifying Persons and, prior to
any such distribution, shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate setting
forth the Agent Expenses actually incurred.

the Company (as the Surviving Corporation) and Parent and the reasonable
assistance of the Companys (as the Surviving Corporation) and Parents

Agent shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information
from or about the Company (as the Surviving Corporation) or Parent to anyone
(except on a need to know basis to individuals (identified to the company
and Parent in writing in advance) who agree in writing to treat such
information confidentially).

Section 8.5 _Actions of the Stockholders  Agent_. A decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Stockholders Agent shall constitute a decision of all
of the Indemnifying Persons and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each and every Company Holder, and the Escrow Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation may rely upon any decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Stockholders Agent as being the decision, act, consent
or instruction of each and every Company Holder. The Escrow Agent and Parent
are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them
in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders Agent.

 

Section 8.6 _Third-Party Claims_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
5.6(b)_, in the event that Parent becomes aware of a third-party claim ("
_Third Party Claim_ ") which Parent believes may result in an indemnification
obligation under this _ARTICLE VIII_ , Parent shall promptly notify the
Stockholders Agent of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the failure to give prompt notice shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Stockholders Agent, on behalf of
the Indemnifying Persons, has been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. The notice of Third Party Claim shall include, based on the
information then available to Parent, a summary in reasonable detail of the
basis for the Third Party Claim. The Stockholders Agent, on behalf of the
Indemnifying Persons, shall, at its expense and without recourse to the Escrow
Fund, be entitled to participate in any defense of such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have full control over the
Third Party Claim, including settlement and compromise thereof (other than
any settlement or compromise that would expose any director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to individual liability or criminal
sanctions); _provided_ , _ further,_ that notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no Parent Indemnified Person shall settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of
any judgment with respect any Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Persons
will not be bound by the entry of any such settlement or compromise effected
or any such judgment consented to, without the prior written consent of the
Stockholders Agent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed,

 



50  provided that in connection with any Third Party Claim that may arise from
any lawsuit, action, proceeding, claim, complaint, subpoena, investigation or
dispute, in each case, of which the Company has Knowledge as of the date of
this Agreement and which is pending or threatened as of the date of this
Agreement the Stockholders Agent may only object to a settlement to the
extent that Parent had no reasonable basis to agree to the settlement based
on the facts and circumstances known at the time); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Stockholders Agent shall be deemed not to have objected to any
settlement of any such Third Party Claims unless the Stockholders Agent
shall have objected in writing to Parent within twenty (20) days after the
Stockholders Agent receipt of a written notice from Parent of such proposed
or actual settlement. The Escrow Agent shall not disburse any portion of the
Escrow Fund to any third party except in accordance with joint written
instructions received from Parent and the Stockholders Agent. In the event
that the Stockholders Agent has failed to timely object to any
such settlement, neither the Stockholders Agent nor any Indemnifying Person
shall have any power or authority to object under the Escrow Agreement or any
provision of this _ARTICLE VIII_ to any claim by any Parent Indemnified Person
for indemnity in the amount of such settlement, together with related
Damages.

Section 8.7 _No Right of Contribution_. Neither the Stockholders Agent nor
any Company Holder shall make any claim for contribution from the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers, directors or employees with respect to any indemnity claims arising
under or in connection with this Agreement to the extent that the Company,
Surviving Corporation or any Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification
hereunder for such claim, and the Stockholders Agent, on its own behalf and
on behalf of all Indemnifying Persons, hereby waives any such right of
contribution from the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any of its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective officers, directors or employees it
has or may have in the future.

Section 8.8 _Effect of Investigation; Reliance_. The right to indemnification,
payment of Damages or any other remedy will not be affected by any
investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company or any other matter. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any such representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any such covenant or agreement, will not
affect the right to indemnification, payment of Damages, or any other remedy
based on any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. No
Parent Indemnified Person shall be required to show reliance on any
representation, warranty, certificate or other agreement in order for such
Parent Indemnified Person to be entitled to indemnification hereunder. Parent
and the Company each acknowledge that such Damages, if any, would relate to
unresolved contingencies existing at the Effective Time, which if resolved at
the Effective Time would have led to a reduction in the Purchase Price that
Parent would have paid in connection with the Merger.

Section 8.9 _Tax Benefits; Insurance_.

 

(a) The amount of Damages for which a Parent Indemnified Person shall be
indemnified pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ shall be determined without
regard to any potential reduction in Taxes of such Parent Indemnified Person
attributable to the Damages that gave rise to indemnification. If and to the
extent that there is any Tax Benefit Actually Realized for taxable periods of
Parent and its affiliates ending on or before the date that is three (3) years
after the Closing by the relevant Parent Indemnified Person, Parent shall, no
later than 30 days after the Parent Indemnified Person Actually Realizes such
Tax Benefit, pay or cause to be paid the amount of such Tax Benefit Actually
Realized to the Stockholders Agent for the benefit of the Indemnifying
Persons, provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to make any
payment in excess of the indemnification payment or payments actually
received by the Parent Indemnified Person.

(b) For purposes of  _Section 8.9(a)_:

(i) The term "Tax Benefit Actually Realized" shall mean an actual reduction
in the amount of Taxes paid or payable by the relevant Parent Indemnified
Person, determined by comparing (x) the amount of Taxes actually owed by the
relevant Parent Indemnified Person and (y) the amount of Taxes that would
have been owed without regard to any Tax items attributable to the Damages
that gave rise to the relevant indemnification payment.

 



51 (ii) For the avoidance of doubt, (a) where a Parent Indemnified Person has
other Tax items available to it, the Tax items attributable to such Damages
shall be treated as the last Tax items used and (b) the amount of a Tax
Benefit shall be determined taking into account (i) all increases in federal,
state, local or other taxes (including estimated taxes) payable by the
applicable Parent Indemnified Person as a result of the receipt of any
indemnity payment (e.g., as a result of the indemnity payment being included
in income, resulting in a reduction of tax basis, or otherwise), and (ii) to
the extent not previously taken into account in computing the amount of the
relevant Damages, all increases in federal, state, local or other taxes
(including estimated taxes) payable by the Parent Indemnified Person as a
result of the indemnified event.

(iii) In the event that, following any payment by Parent pursuant to this
_Section 8.9_, there is any reduction in any Tax Benefit Actually Realized as
a result of a Parent Indemnified Person subsequently realizing a deduction,
loss, credit or other item that can be carried back or forward to any year in
which a Tax Benefit previously was Actually Realized or any Tax authority
requires any adjustment that results in the reduction of any Tax Benefit in
respect of which Parent has made a payment under _Section 8.9(a)_, the
Indemnifying Persons shall promptly pay to Parent the amount of such reduction
plus interest calculated at the appropriate applicable federal rate from the
date that Parent first paid such amount to the to the Stockholders Agent for
the benefit of the Indemnifying Persons.

 

(c) The calculation of any Damages under this _ARTICLE VIII_ will reflect the
amount of any insurance proceeds received in cash by the Parent Indemnified
Persons in respect of such Damage, net of the present value of any reasonably
probable increase in insurance premiums or other charges paid or to be paid by
the Parent Indemnified Persons resulting from such Damage and all costs and
expenses, including attorneys fees and expenses, incurred by any Parent
Indemnified Persons in recovering such proceeds from its insurers.

Section 9.3 _Amendments and Waivers_.

(a) Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, the parties hereto may cause
this Agreement to be amended at any time by execution of an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, the Company and the Stockholders
Agent; _provided, however,_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
provided in this Agreement, (i) any amendment to this Agreement that would (x)
disproportionately adversely affect a Company Holder that holds more than ten
percent (10%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of the
date hereof in a material manner relative to the other Company Holders or (y)
that directly or indirectly reduces or otherwise adversely affects the
economic benefits running to such a Company Holder that holds more than ten
percent (10%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of the date
hereof under this Agreement, in each case shall require the prior written
consent of such Company Holder.

 

(b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may, to the
extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party and specifically referencing the
provisions being waived. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the
part of any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy.

 



61 Section 9.4  _Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest_. This
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein
or therein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the Exhibits, the
Schedules, including the Company Disclosure Schedule (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, (b) except as
specifically stated in a particular section of the transaction documents
referred to above, shall not create or be deemed to create any third party
beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party to this Agreement, (c)
except by operation of the Merger, shall not be assigned by operation of law
or otherwise except as otherwise specifically provided; _ provided, however_
, that Parent may (x) assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder
to one or more of its affiliates, and (y) designate one or more of its
affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases
Parent nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all of its
obligations hereunder), and (d) shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 9.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement,
or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

Section 9.6 _Governing Law_. 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS OR COUNTERCLAIMS (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF, SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISION
OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT
WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE
STATE OF DELAWARE.

 

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and to the
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the State of Delaware,
for the purpose of any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement thereof, and each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware state or
federal court.

(c) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of
itself or its property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to
such party to the address at which such party is to receive notice in
accordance with _Section 9.1_ hereof and nothing in this _Section 9.6_ shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, (ii) consents to submit itself to
the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court
of the State of Delaware and any federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and (iv) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if (but
only if) the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any other court
of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware). Each of Parent,

 



62  Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal
Requirements.

Section 9.7 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution
of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. The rights
and remedies of the parties hereto shall be cumulative (and not alternative).

Section 9.9 _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings herein are
inserted for convenience only and are not intended to be part of or to affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 9.10  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by facsimile), all of which shall be considered one
and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

 

Section 9.11 _Tax Treatment_. Any payment under _ARTICLE VIII_ of this
Agreement shall be treated by the parties for income Tax purposes as an
