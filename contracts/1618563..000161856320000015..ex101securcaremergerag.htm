interests of Parent and the holders of Parent Common Shares, and (ii) approved

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER



1.01 The Merger.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub in
accordance with the provisions of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act
(6 Del. C. §§ 18-101 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the "Delaware
Act"), and the Colorado Business Corporation Act (the "CBCA"). As a result of
the Merger, the separate existence of the Company shall cease and Merger Sub
shall continue its existence under the laws of the State of Delaware as the
surviving company (in such capacity, Merger Sub is sometimes referred to
herein as the "Surviving Company").

(b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of
merger substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto (the "Certificate of
Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings required by the
Delaware Act in connection with the Merger. Additionally, at the Closing, the
Company and Merger Sub shall cause a statement of merger substantially in the
form of Exhibit C hereto (the "Statement of Merger") to be executed,
acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Colorado
and make all other filings or recordings required by the CBCA in connection
with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware and the Statement of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Colorado or at such other time as Parent and the Company
shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger and Statement of Merger
(the "Effective Time").

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall succeed to
all the assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and be
subject to all of the Liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided in this Agreement and under the
Delaware Act and the CBCA.

1.02 Effect of the Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof: (a) each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled in full and converted into the right of each
Securityholder thereof to receive from Parent (i) that number of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common Shares equal to the
Exchange Ratio as set forth on Schedule A hereto, or (ii) cash in the amount
determined in accordance with Section 1.03(b); provided that the number of
Parent Common Shares to which each Securityholder will be entitled pursuant to
this Section 1.02(a), as may be adjusted by Section 1.03(b), will be rounded
up to the next whole number of Parent Common Shares to the extent the Exchange
Ratio yields any fractional amount of Parent Common Shares; and

(b) each unit of membership interest of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
(1) unit of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable membership interest
of the Surviving Company.

1.03 Exchange Procedures.

(a) Company shall cause each Securityholder to fully complete the investor
questionnaire attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Investor Questionnaire"), and
the Company shall direct each Securityholder to accurately complete such
Investor Questionnaire to be in all material respects true, correct and
complete. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Company
and the Key Person shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each
Securityholder to deliver to Parent a completed Investor Questionnaire.

(b) To the extent that any Securityholder does not deliver an Investor
Questionnaire by the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to Closing or a
Securityholder, that is not an Accredited Investor nor a Sophisticated
Investor (each as defined in the Investor Questionnaire), has failed to
appoint a "purchaser representative" in accordance with Section 5.05(b) (each,
an "Ineligible Securityholder"), then each such Securityholder will forfeit
the right to receive Parent Common Shares and Parent may, rather than issuing
Parent Common Shares to such Securityholders, in its sole discretion, choose
to deliver to such Securityholder cash in the amount equal to such
Securityholder\'s Pro Rata Share of the Closing Consideration as determined in
accordance with the Payment Schedule and the valuation date and metrics
originally used to determine the Closing Consideration ("Cash Consideration"),
and the number of Parent Common Shares to be issued in accordance with the
Closing Consideration will be reduced accordingly. To the extent Cash
Consideration is paid in lieu of Parent Common Shares, all references to
issuance of Parent Common Shares as Closing Consideration and all associated
definitions, including the definitions of Closing Consideration and Allocated
Consideration, shall be deemed amended to reflect the forgoing.

(c) On the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to each Securityholder (i) a
letter of transmittal substantially in the form of Exhibit E attached hereto
("Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected
upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and
which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company
prior to the Closing, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of such Company Shares for delivery of such Securityholder\'s Allocated
Consideration.

(d) Upon surrender to Parent of Company Shares, together with the Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, such Securityholders shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Allocated Consideration pursuant to the provisions of
this Article I (which in the case of Allocated Consideration consisting of Parent Common Shares shall be in uncertificated book-entry form). No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of Securityholders on the
Allocated Consideration payable in respect of such Company Shares. If delivery
of the Allocated Consideration is to be made to a Person other than a
Securityholder, it shall be a condition of delivery that Company Shares so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Allocated
Consideration to a Person other than the Securityholder of such Company Shares
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Company that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.03(d), each Company Share shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Allocated Consideration deliverable in respect
of such Company Shares.

1.04 Termination of Rights. All Allocated Consideration delivered upon the
surrender of and in exchange for Company Shares in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been delivered in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Shares. If, after the Effective Time,
Company Shares are presented to the Surviving Company or Parent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Allocated Consideration
deliverable in respect of the Company Shares previously represented by such
Company Shares without any interest thereon.

1.05 No Liability. None of the Surviving Company or Parent shall be liable to
any Securityholder for any Allocated Consideration or other amounts properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Company Share has not been surrendered prior to
the time that is immediately prior to the time at which the Allocated
Consideration in respect of such Company Share would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Company Share shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

1.06 Final Closing Calculations.

(a) As promptly as possible, but in any event within seventy-five (75) days
after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the Securityholder
Representative a statement showing its good faith assessment of the Retained
Cash Amounts ("Actual Retained Cash Amounts") and Undisclosed Liabilities of
the Company as of the Effective Time (the "Closing Statement").

(b) As promptly as possible, but in any event within seventy-five (75) days
after the completion of the annual financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2020, Parent shall deliver to the Securityholder Representative a
statement showing the combined capital expenditures of the Company and the
Surviving Company, for the years ending December 31, 2019 and December 31,
2020 (the "CapEx Statement").

(c) The Closing Statement and the CapEx Statement shall be prepared and the
Retained Cash Amounts, Undisclosed Liabilities, and the Final CapEx Amount
shall be determined, in accordance with this Agreement. After delivery of
either the Closing Statement or the CapEx Statement, the Securityholder
Representative and its accountants shall be permitted reasonable access at
reasonable times to review the Surviving Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
books and records related to the preparation of the Closing Statement or the
CapEx Statement, as applicable. (d) If the Securityholder Representative has any objections to either the
Closing Statement or the CapEx Statement, the Securityholder Representative
shall deliver to Parent a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an
"Objections Statement"). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to Parent
within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of the Closing
Statement, the Closing Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by
the Parties ("Final Closing Statement"). If an Objections Statement is not
delivered to Parent within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of
the CapEx Statement, the CapEx Statement shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the Parties (the "Final CapEx Statement"). The Securityholder
Representative and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
objections contained in an Objection Statement, but if they do not reach a
final resolution within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Objections
Statement, the Securityholder Representative and Parent shall submit such
dispute to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Securityholder Representative (the "Dispute
Resolution Expert"). Any submissions to the Dispute Resolution Expert must be
written and delivered to each party to the dispute. The Dispute Resolution
Expert shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and shall consider only
those items and amounts that are identified in the Objections Statement as
items which the Securityholder Representative and Parent are unable to
resolve. The Dispute Resolution Expert\'s determination shall be based solely
on the definitions of Actual Retained Cash Amounts, Shared Transaction
Expenses Amount, Undisclosed Liabilities, and the Final CapEx Amount contained
herein (and defined terms contained within those definitions) and the
provisions of this Agreement, including this Section 1.06, and shall not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such items
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such items claimed
by either party. The Securityholder Representative and Parent shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution Expert to
resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable in amounts between the
disputed amounts set forth in the Closing Statement or CapEx Statement, as the
case may be, and the Objections Statement and by no later than thirty (30)
days following appointment of the Dispute Resolution Expert. Further, the
Dispute Resolution Expert\'s determination shall be based solely on the
presentations by Parent and the Securityholder Representative that are in
accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e.,
not on the basis of an independent review). The resolution of the dispute by
the Dispute Resolution Expert shall be the exclusive process for resolving
such disputes and shall be final and binding on and non-appealable by the
Parties hereto.

(e) The costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Expert shall be allocated
between Parent, on the one hand, and the Securityholder Representative (on
behalf of the Securityholders), on the other hand, based upon the percentage
that the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to
the amount actually contested by such Party. For example, if the
Securityholder Representative claims Undisclosed Liabilities are $1,000
greater than the amount determined by Parent, and Parent contests only $500 of
the amount claimed by the Securityholder Representative, and if the Dispute
Resolution Expert ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the
Securityholder Representative (for the benefit of the Securityholders) $300 of
the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration shall be
allocated sixty percent (60%) (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to Parent and forty percent
(40%) (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to the Securityholder Representative (for the benefit
of the Securityholders). The Securityholder Representative and Parent
recognize that the Dispute Resolution Expert may resolve the Objections
Statements or the CapEx Statement on an item-by-item basis so that it may
choose the Securityholder Representative\'s position on some items and
Parent\'s position on other items or a compromise position. 1.07 Post-Closing Retained Cash Amount and Undisclosed Liabilities Adjustment.

(a) After the determination of the Final Closing Statement, if the Actual
Retained Cash Amounts are less than the amount required to be left in the
Company as Retained Cash Amounts in accordance with Section 5.10 ("Cash
Shortage"), Securityholder Representative, on behalf of the Securityholders,
shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days following the
final determination of the Final Closing Statement) deliver to Parent cash
equal to the Cash Shortage ("Cash Shortage Payment"), as may be adjusted by
Section 1.07(b).

(b) After the determination of the Final Closing Statement, if the Final
Undisclosed Liabilities are less than the Target Undisclosed Liabilities
Amount ("Liabilities Excess"), then (i) if there is no Cash Shortage as
determined in accordance with Section 1.07(a), Parent shall promptly (but in
any event within five (5) Business Days following the final determination of
the Final Closing Statement) deliver to the Securityholder Representative cash
in an amount equal to such Liabilities Excess, which is then to be distributed
to the Securityholders by the Securityholder Representative in accordance with
the Payment Schedule ("Liabilities Excess Payment"); (ii) if there is a Cash
Shortage that is less than the Liabilities Excess, there will be no Cash
Shortage Payment and there will be a Liabilities Excess Payment by Parent to
the Securityholders in the amount of Liabilities Excess minus the Cash
Shortage; and (iii) if there is a Cash Shortage that is greater than the
Liabilities Excess, there will be no Liabilities Excess Payment and there will
be a Cash Shortage Payment by the Securityholder Representative, on behalf of
the Securityholders in the amount of Cash Shortage minus the Liabilities
Excess.

(c) After the determination of the Final Undisclosed Liabilities, if such
Final Undisclosed Liabilities are greater than the Target Undisclosed
Liabilities Amount (the "Liabilities Shortfall"), the Securityholder
Representative, on behalf of the Securityholders, shall promptly (but in any
event within five (5) Business Days following the final determination of the
Final Closing Statement) deliver to Parent cash equal to the Liabilities
Shortfall, in addition to any other payment that may be required under Section
1.07(a).

1.08 Capital Expenditure Adjustment.

(a) After the determination of the Final CapEx Statement, if the Final CapEx
Amount is equal to or less than the 2020 Target CapEx Amount, then Parent
shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days following the
final determination of the Final CapEx Statement) deliver to the
Securityholder Representative cash in an amount equal to the CapEx Adjustment
Amount, which is then to be distributed to the Securityholders by the
Securityholder Representative in accordance with the Payment Schedule.

(b) After the determination of the Final CapEx Statement, if the Final CapEx
Amount is greater than 2020 Target CapEx Amount but less than the 2020
Budgeted CapEx Amount, then Parent shall promptly (but in any event within
five (5) Business Days following the final determination of the Final CapEx

equal to the difference between such Final CapEx Amount and the 2020 Budgeted
CapEx Amount, which is then to be distributed to the Securityholders by the
Securityholder Representative in accordance with the Payment Schedule. (c) After the determination of the Final CapEx Statement, if the Final CapEx
Amount is equal to or greater than the 2020 Budgeted CapEx Amount, then Parent
shall retain the entire CapEx Adjustment Amount.

1.09 Transaction Adjustments. For the avoidance of doubt, the payments that
are made between the Parties pursuant to Sections 1.06, 1.07, and 1.08 will be
treated as purchase price adjustments for tax purposes with any payments made
by the Securityholders pursuant to such sections treated as the purchase of
additional Parent Common Shares.

1.10 Withholding. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, each of the Surviving Company and Parent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Allocated Consideration to be delivered, and any payment
otherwise required to be paid, to any Securityholder, on behalf of the
applicable Securityholder, pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the delivery of such Allocated
Consideration or the making of such payment under any provision of applicable
Tax Law. If the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds
any portion of the Allocated Consideration or any other payments owed to any
Person, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been delivered or paid to such Person in respect of which the Surviving
Company, or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

1.11 Assignment and Assumption of Affiliated Lease. At the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company will assume the responsibilities of the Company as tenant
under the Affiliated Lease. The Surviving Company will have a one-time ability
to terminate the Affiliated Lease on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date upon at least 180 days\' prior notice to the Affiliate Landlord.

1.12 Integration Services Payment. Prior to the Closing, SecurCare Management
LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, shall make a payment in the
amount of $500,000 to a subsidiary of Parent\'s designation in order to
compensate Parent for the services and cost of integrating the employees of
SecurCare Management LLC and the employees of the Nord Capital Companies who
accept an offer of employment pursuant to Section 6.08 hereof.

1.13 Tax Treatment. The Parties intend and agree that, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, (a) the Merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, and (b) this Agreement be,
and hereby is adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Section
354 and 361 of the Code. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the
Parties shall file all U.S. federal, state and local Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the intended tax treatment of the Merger described in this
Section 1.13, and no Party shall take a position inconsistent with such
treatment.

ARTICLE II

THE CLOSING



2.01 The Closing. The closing of the Transactions (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Clifford Chance US LLP located at 31 West 52nd Street,
New York, New York 10019, at 10:00 a.m. on the second (2nd) Business Day
following full satisfaction or due waiver of all of the closing conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing
itself, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or on
such other date and/or time as is mutually agreed to in writing by Parent and
the Securityholder Representative. The date and time of the Closing are
referred to herein as the "Closing Date." 2.02 The Closing Transactions. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the Parties shall consummate the following transactions at
the Closing:

(a) As soon as practicable following the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub
shall cause the Certificate of Merger and Statement of Merger to be executed,
acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
and the Secretary of State of the State of Colorado, respectively;

(b) in accordance with Section 1.03, Parent shall issue and deliver, or cause
to be delivered, to each Securityholder its Allocated Consideration (less the
pro rata portion of the Retained Parent Common Shares, subject to any
adjustment pursuant to Section 1.03(b));

(c) Parent and the Company shall make such other deliveries as are required by
Article VI hereof.

2.03 Acknowledgment and Waiver. The Securityholders each agree that the
calculations set forth in the Payment Schedule can be relied on in full by
Parent and Merger Sub, and that the aggregate Closing Consideration and the
disbursement of the Allocated Consideration in accordance with the Payment
Schedule is the full and final amount owed to the Securityholders in exchange
for the conversion and cancellation of the Company Shares as set forth in
Section 1.02, accounting for the value of the OP Units, and that upon
satisfying its payment obligations pursuant to Section 2.02(b) subject to
compliance with Sections 1.07, 1.08 and 8.08, Parent shall have satisfied in
full any payment or other obligations in respect of the Company Shares of the
Securityholders that would otherwise be outstanding pursuant to the terms of
the FPMA or otherwise and following the Closing none of the Securityholders
shall have any rights remaining under the FPMA and any such rights shall be
deemed discharged and cancelled in full, except that each covenant or
agreement of any party to the FPMA that is to be performed after the
termination of the FPMA shall survive the termination and shall remain in full
force and effect until fully performed in accordance with its terms.

2.04 Indemnification Holdback. At the Closing, Parent shall deduct from the
Closing Consideration the amount of Parent Common Shares equal to $7.5
million, based on the Value of such shares on December 31, 2019, rounded up to
the nearest whole number to avoid any fractional shares (the "Retained Parent
Common Shares"), which shall be held by Parent in a segregated brokerage
account (the "Indemnification Account") along with quarterly dividends earned
on the Retained Parent Common Shares (the "Retained Dividends"), for the
benefit of the Securityholders, until such Retained Parent Common Shares and
Retained Dividends are delivered to the Securityholders pursuant to the
provisions of Section 8.08(b). For the avoidance of doubt, Retained Dividends
shall be used first in satisfaction of any claims, prior to liquidating and
using any Retained Parent Common Shares that are ultimately used for the
satisfaction of any claim under Section 8.02, and any such Retained Dividends
(including any Retained Dividends pertaining to any Retained Parent Common
Shares where such shares are used for the satisfaction of any claim under
Section 8.02, because for example at the time of payment in settlement of any
such claim those dividends had not been declared and paid) will not be
delivered to Securityholders, but rather shall be returned to, and remain the
exclusive property of, Parent. ARTICLE III

(a) The Company\'s unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
2019 (the "Latest Balance Sheet Date") and the related income statement for
the twelve‑month period then ended and the Company\'s unaudited consolidated
balance sheets and income statements for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2018 and December 31, 2017 (collectively, the "Financial Statements") have
been prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP, consistently

of the Group Companies (taken as a whole) as of the times and for the periods referred to therein,
subject to (i) the absence of footnote disclosure and other presentation
items, (ii) changes resulting from normal year-end audit adjustments (the
effect of which will not, individually or in the aggregate, be material), and
(iii) the methodology used by the Company for valuation of the OP Units. The
Company has maintained accurate books and records of account in which complete
entries have been made of its business transactions pursuant to a system of
accounting established and administered in all material respects in accordance
with GAAP, with the exception of the methodology used by the Company for
valuation of the OP Units. The books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are true and complete in all respects and the Financial
Statements have been derived from such books and records. True and complete
copies of the Financial Statements are included on Schedule 3.06(a).

(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.06(b), no Group Company has any
Liabilities that would be required to be disclosed on its Financial Statements
(excluding footnotes) under GAAP, whether known or unknown, direct or
indirect, accrued or fixed, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured or
otherwise, other than Liabilities reflected in and reserved against in the
Financial Statements and the Company\'s unaudited consolidated balance sheets
and income statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, except
Liabilities that (i) have been incurred since the Latest Balance Sheet Date in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and (ii) are
expressly provided for under this Agreement or that have been incurred in
connection with the Transactions.

(c) The systems of internal accounting controls maintained by the Group
Companies are sufficient to provide reasonable assurances: (i) that
transactions are executed in accordance with management\'s general or specific
authorization; (ii) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' financial statements in
conformity with GAAP; (iii) that access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management\'s general or specific authorization; (iv) that the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals, and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences; and (v) regarding the prevention or detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' assets
that would have a material adverse effect on the Financial Statements.

3.07 Absence of Certain Developments. Since the Latest Balance Sheet Date,
there has not been, with respect to any Group Company, any:

(a) event, occurrence or development that has had, or could reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;

(b) action taken that, if taken during the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Closing Date without Parent\'s consent, would constitute
a breach of Section 5.01(a).

3.08 Property and Assets.

(a) Each Group Company has good and marketable title to, or other valid right
to use, free and clear of any Liens (other than Permitted Liens), all of the
assets, property and rights that it owns. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.08(a), the assets, property and rights set forth on Schedule 3.08(a),
constitute all the material assets, property and rights owned by each Group
Company and all of the material property used in, and required for the
operation of, the business of the Group Companies as currently conducted. Such assets, property and rights
are sufficient for each Group Company to conduct its business as currently
conducted. All material items of tangible property used in the operation of
the business of the Group Companies are in good operating condition, except
for normal wear and tear.

(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.08(b), no approval or consent of any
Person is required so that the interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in such property shall continue in full force and effect and be enforceable by
Parent following Closing.

3.09 Real Property.

(a) No Group Company owns any real property.

(b) Schedule 3.09(b) sets forth all leases, licenses, subleases and occupancy
agreements, together with any material amendments thereto (the "Real Property
Leases"), with respect to all real property leased, licensed, subleased or
otherwise used or occupied by the Group Companies as of the date hereof (the
"Leased Real Property") and the Leased Real Property constitutes all of the
real property used in the operation of the business of the Group Companies.
The Real Property Leases are in full force and effect, and a Group Company
holds a valid, binding, enforceable and existing leasehold interest under each
such Real Property Lease, subject to the application of any bankruptcy or
creditor\'s rights Laws, and subject to Permitted Liens. The Company has
delivered or made available to Parent complete and accurate copies of each of
the Real Property Leases, and none of such Real Property Leases have been
modified in any material respect as of the date hereof, except to the extent
that such modifications are disclosed by the copies delivered or made
available to Parent. To the Company\'s Knowledge, no Group Company is in
default in any material respect under any of the Real Property Leases, and
each Leased Real Property has been maintained in accordance with normal
industry practice, is in good operating condition and repair (subject to
normal wear and tear) and is suitable for the purposes for which it is
currently used.

(a) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has timely filed (or has had
timely filed on its behalf) with the appropriate taxing authority all Tax
Returns that it was required to file (or that was required to have been filed
on its behalf), taking into account any extensions of time to file, and all

extension of the time for filing any Tax Return to a date later than the

for Taxes of any of the Company or its subsidiaries has been claimed, proposed
or assessed, or threatened by any Governmental Entity, which deficiency has
not yet been settled except for such deficiencies which are being contested in
good faith.

understanding or arrangement described in Section 6662(d)(2)(C)(ii) of the

(j) None of the Company or its subsidiaries is treated or has been treated for
Tax purposes as a resident in a country other than the country of its
organization and none of the Company or its subsidiaries has, or has had, a
branch, agency, trade or business, or permanent establishment for Tax purposes
in a country other than the country of its organization. No claim has been
made by any Tax authority in a jurisdiction where any of the Company or its
subsidiaries has not filed a Tax Return that it is or may be subject to Tax by
such jurisdiction, and no reason for such a claim exists.

(k) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, as a successor to the Company and its
subsidiaries, will be required for Tax purposes to include any material item

taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result
of any: (i) change in method of accounting made on or prior to the Closing

within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code (and any applicable provisions of state or
local law) at all times since the Company\'s taxable year ended December 31,
1996 for all federal and applicable state and local income Tax purposes, and
the Company has qualified as an S corporation at all times up to and including
its taxable year ended December 31, 2019. The Company will elect and qualify
(assuming Parent qualifies as a REIT) to be taxed as a REIT, with respect to
its taxable year commencing January 1, 2020 and ending on the Closing Date.
All subsidiaries of the Company are, and since formation have been, treated as
disregarded entities or partnerships for U.S. federal income Tax purposes and
all applicable state and local Tax purposes, except for SecurCare Management
LLC which will elect to be taxed as a corporation effective January 1, 2020
and qualify as a taxable REIT subsidiary within the meaning of Section 856(l)
of the Code ("Taxable REIT Subsidiary") of the Company commencing on such
date. No subsidiary of the Company is or has been treated as a qualified
subchapter S subsidiary within the meaning of Section 1361(b)(3)(B) of the
Code (a "Qualified Subchapter S Subsidiary"). The Company has no earnings and
profits, and will have at the time of the Closing no earnings and profits (i)
attributable to any period during which the Company was not or failed to
qualify as an S corporation prior to its election to be taxed as a REIT, (ii)
acquired from an entity treated as a C corporation for U.S. federal income Tax

attributable to any entity with respect to any period that such entity was not
treated as a REIT or an S corporation, as determined for purposes of Section
857(a)(2)(B) of the Code. Any existing or prior trust shareholder of the
Company has qualified as an eligible S corporation shareholder (under Section
1361(c)(2) of the Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder) at all times since
its formation.

(m) None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has taken any action or

to jeopardize or prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

(n) Each Securityholder is a United States Person within the meaning of
Section 1445 of the Code, and accordingly no withholding applies for U.S.
federal, state, or local Tax purposes with respect to any portion of the
consideration received pursuant to the Merger.

(o) This Section 3.10 constitutes the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to Taxes related
to the Company and its subsidiaries, except for those in Section 3.15, and no
other representation or warranty contained in any other section of this
Agreement shall apply to any such Tax matters and no other representation or
warranty, express or implied, is being made with respect thereto.

require agreeing to any obligations or accommodations (financial or otherwise)
binding on a Group Company in the event the Closing does not occur.

through the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, none of the
Company, any Key Person or any controlled Affiliate of a Key Person shall take

initiate, solicit or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or knowingly
provide any information to or respond to the submission of any proposal or
offer from, any Person (other than Parent and Parent\'s Representatives)
concerning any purchase of a majority of the outstanding equity interest or
any merger, sale of substantially all of the assets of the Group Companies or

representatives to, cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions,

such Securityholders to appoint, prior to their aforementioned written
consent, a "purchaser representative" for the purposes of facilitating their
ability to receive Parent Common Shares by way of consideration for the Merger
and the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement in compliance with
securities Laws, but in any event the Company Requisite Approval will be
obtained, prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date of this
Agreement.

termination of, all Affiliate Agreements, and all amounts due and payable
thereunder and any and all future obligations owing thereunder shall be
cancelled, in each case with no further Liabilities surviving the Closing.

of this Agreement and the Closing Date, if after the date of this Agreement

breach of any representation or warranty made in Article III or any covenant
that would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(a) or Section

Company shall disclose to Parent such breach. The Company, or if after the
Closing, the Securityholder Representative, shall give prompt notice to Parent

Material Adverse Effect on its consummation.

the Cash of the Company at the Closing, after maintaining (and disregarding
for these purposes) Cash reserves in an amount sufficient to meet trade and

consistent with past practice, is no less than $2.5 million, representing a
sum of the amounts being left in the Company for (a) the Shared Transaction Expenses Amount, (b)
the CapEx Adjustment Amount, and (c) the Target Undisclosed Liabilities Amount
(the Cash left at the Company for the purposes of the Shared Transaction
Expenses Amount, the CapEx Adjustment Amount, and the Target Undisclosed
Liabilities Amount, the "Retained Cash Amounts").

except that each covenant or agreement of any Party or of any Securityholder
that is to be performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing and shall
remain in full force and effect until fully performed in accordance with its
terms. Parent may not make a claim against the Securityholders for the breach
of a representation or warranty or covenant after the applicable survival
period. The Securityholders may not make any claim against Parent or Merger
Sub for breach of a representation or warranty or covenants after the Closing,
and thereafter there shall be no liability on the part of, nor shall any claim
be made by, any Party, Securityholder or any of their respective Affiliates in
respect thereof, except, in each case, in respect of Fraud or willful breaches
by Parent with respect to its obligations under this Agreement and except for
a covenant that is to be performed after the Closing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.01 to the contrary, any claims
asserted in good faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at
such time) and in writing by notice from the non-breaching Party to the
breaching Party prior to the expiration date of the applicable survival period
shall not be barred by the expiration of such survival period and such claims
shall survive until finally resolved.

8.02 Indemnification. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Article VIII, the Key Persons, jointly and severally, and/or the
Securityholders, severally, shall indemnify and defend each of Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) and their respective directors,
officers, employees, advisors, representatives and other authorized persons
(each, a "Parent Indemnitee") against, and shall hold each of them harmless
from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all
Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Parent Indemnitees based
upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
the Company or the Securityholders contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate, instrument, or other document delivered by or on behalf of the
Company or any Securityholder pursuant to this Agreement (including for the
avoidance of doubt, any letter of transmittal delivered pursuant to Section
1.03(c)), as of the date such representation or warranty was made or as if
such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date (except
for representations and warranties that expressly relate to a specified date,
the inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with reference to such
specified date) and, in each case, other than for the representations
contained in Section 3.07(a), determined without giving effect to any
"material", "materiality", "in any material respect", "material adverse

(d) any of the matters set forth on Schedule 3.13.



8.03 Certain Limitations. The indemnification provided for in Section 8.02 is
subject to the following limitations:

(a) A Securityholder will not be liable to the Parent Indemnitees under
Section 8.02(a) until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of
indemnification under Section 8.02(a) equals or exceeds $250,000 (the
"Deductible"), and once this threshold is met, then only for amounts above the
Deductible, up to the Cap; provided, however, that the Deductible shall not
apply with respect to any breach of any Company Fundamental Representation,
any claims made pursuant to Sections 3.10 or 3.15, or any claim for Fraud.

(b) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Securityholders will be
liable pursuant to Section 8.02, will not exceed an amount equivalent to the
Value of the Retained Parent Common Shares on the Release Date plus any other
amounts held in the Indemnification Account from time to time (the "Cap") and,
with respect to Section 8.02, shall be solely and exclusively recoverable from
the Retained Parent Common Shares plus any other amounts held in the
Indemnification Account from time to time; provided, however, that the
foregoing provision shall not apply with respect to payments required to be
made by the Securityholders pursuant to any breach of the representations made
in Sections 3.04 and 3.05, and with respect to breach of any post-closing
covenants that are to be performed after the Release Date, for which the cap
will be the Closing Consideration actually received by the Securityholders
plus the Retained Common Shares (including any other amounts held in the
Indemnification Account from time to time) and to the extent such Losses
exceed the amount of Retained Parent Common Shares and any other amounts
available in the Indemnification Account at such time, the excess amount will
be recoverable in cash from the Securityholders.

(c) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is available to any
Parent Indemnitee under this Article VIII shall be calculated after giving
effect to, and to the extent of, any such amounts (i) actually recovered by
such Party (A) under any insurance policies with respect to such Loss or (B)
from third parties, in each case, net of any cost and expenses incurred by
such Parent Indemnitee in procuring such recovery (including any retention or
deductible with respect to insurance policies, and (ii) specifically taken
into account as a deduction to the Closing Consideration in the reconciliation
of working capital. The Parent Indemnitees shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to recover under available insurance policies or indemnity,
contribution or other similar agreements for any Losses, but any such efforts
shall not be a condition of seeking indemnification under this Agreement.

8.04 No Contribution. Each Securityholder waives, and acknowledges and agrees
that such Securityholder shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or
attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity,
right of subrogation or advancement of expenses or other right or remedy
against the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
any indemnification obligation or any other liability to which such
Securityholder may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement
or any other agreement or document delivered to Parent in connection with this 8.05 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties for Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Law, and in the case of a payment by the
Securityholders, as a reduction to the Closing Consideration and the purchase
of Company Shares in an amount equal to such reduction by the Securityholders.

8.06 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person (other than Parent, Parent\'s Affiliates, the
Surviving Company or any other Parent Indemnitee) of any claim or Legal
Proceeding (whether against the Surviving Company, Parent or any other Person)
with respect to which any Securityholder may become obligated to hold
harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Parent Indemnitee pursuant to
this Article VIII, Parent shall have the right, at its election, to proceed
with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding on its own with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Securityholder Representative. If Parent so
proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

(a) subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, all reasonable
expenses relating to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding shall be
borne and paid exclusively by the Securityholders;

(b) each Securityholder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Parent in connection with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding
(provided that no Securityholder shall be required to make any admissions
against interest); and

(c) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim or
Legal Proceeding; provided, however, that if Parent settles, adjusts or
compromises any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the
Securityholder Representative, such settlement, adjustment or compromise shall
not be conclusive evidence of the amount of damages incurred by the Parent
Indemnitee in connection with such claim or Legal Proceeding or determinative
of whether a Parent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or other relief
with respect to damages related to such claim or Legal Proceeding (it being
understood that if Parent requests that the Securityholder Representative
consent to a settlement, adjustment or compromise, the Securityholder
Representative shall not unreasonably withhold or delay such consent).

If Parent does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or
Legal Proceeding, the Securityholder Representative may proceed with the
defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to Parent; provided, however, that the Securityholder Representative may not
settle, adjust or compromise any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Parent shall give the Securityholder Representative
prompt notice of the commencement of any such Legal Proceeding against Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company; provided, however, that any failure on the part of
Parent to so notify the Securityholder Representative shall not limit any of
the obligations of the Securityholders under this Article VIII (except to the
extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of such Legal
Proceeding).

8.07 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 12.19, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims
for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation set forth in this Agreement or otherwise relating to the
Transactions, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article VIII. Each Party waives, to the fullest extent permitted under
Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth in this
Agreement or otherwise relating to the Transactions it may have against the
other Parties and their Affiliates and each of their respective representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII.
Nothing in this Section 8.07 shall limit any Person\'s right to seek and
obtain any equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled pursuant to
Section 12.19 or to seek any remedy on account of Fraud.

8.08 Retained Parent Common Shares.

(a) In respect of a claim brought by a Parent Indemnitee against a
Securityholder, pursuant to Section 8.02, payment by a Securityholder shall be
settled solely and exclusively by Parent having recourse to the Retained
Parent Common Shares that have yet to be delivered to the Securityholders and
any other amounts held in the Indemnification Account from time to time. To
the extent there are not enough Retained Parent Common Shares or any other
amounts held in the Indemnification Account from time to time remaining to
satisfy a Securityholder\'s indemnification obligation pursuant to Section
8.02, no Securityholder shall have any monetary obligation or liability,
except that the Key Persons jointly and severally and/or the Securityholders
severally, shall be liable for the remainder of any indemnification claims for
breach of the representations made in Sections 3.04 and 3.05 validly made in
accordance with this Article VIII against any Securityholder.

(b) On the Release Date, Parent shall deliver to each Securityholder, except
for Ineligible Securityholders, to an account or accounts specified in writing
by such Securityholder, such Securityholder\'s pro rata percentage (as
determined by reference to the Payment Schedule, as adjusted per Section
1.03(b)) of any amount remaining of the Retained Parent Common Shares in
excess of the sum of all amounts on account of any outstanding and unpaid or
unresolved claims for indemnification under Section 8.02. After the resolution
and payment of all such claims, Parent shall deliver to each Securityholder,
to an account or accounts specified in writing by such Securityholder, such
Securityholder\'s pro rata percentage (as determined by reference to the
Payment Schedule) of any amount remaining of the Retained Parent Common
Shares.

prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or making the consummation of the
Transactions illegal, provided, however that the right to terminate this

forth in Article III shall not be true and correct, or if the Company has
failed to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement (including an obligation to consummate the Closing),
such that the conditions to the Closing set forth in either Section 7.01(a) or Section 7.01(b) would not be satisfied as of the Closing Date and the
breach or breaches causing such representations or warranties not to be true
and correct, or the failure to perform any covenant or agreement, as
applicable, are not cured within twenty (20) Business Days after written
notice thereof is delivered to the Company; provided that a failure to obtain
Company Requisite Approval within ten (10) Business Days after the date of
this Agreement, pursuant to Section 5.05(b), will give rise to an immediate
right to terminate on behalf of Parent; provided, further, that Parent and/or
Merger Sub is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause the
conditions to the Closing set forth in either Section 7.02(a) or Section
7.02(b) to not be satisfied as of the Closing Date;

(d) by the Company, if any of the representations or warranties of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in Article IV shall not be true and correct, or if Parent
or Merger Sub has failed to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub, respectively, set forth in this Agreement (including an
obligation to consummate the Closing), such that the conditions to the Closing
set forth in either Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(b) would not be satisfied
as of the Closing Date and the breach or breaches causing such representations
or warranties not to be true and correct, or the failures to perform any
covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not cured within twenty (20)
Business Days after written notice thereof is delivered to Parent or Merger
Sub; provided that the Company is not then in breach of this Agreement so as
to cause the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 7.01(a) or Section
7.01(b) to not be satisfied as of the Closing Date;

(e) by the Company, if the Transactions shall not have been consummated on or
prior to three (3) months following the date of this Agreement (such date, the
"Outside Date") and the Company and the Securityholders shall not have
breached in any material respect any of their obligations under this Agreement
in any manner that shall have proximately caused the failure to consummate the
Transactions on or before the Outside Date; and

(f) by Parent, if the Transactions shall not have been consummated on or prior
to the Outside Date and Parent shall not have breached in any material respect
its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately
caused the failure to consummate the Transactions on or before the Outside
Date.

9.02 Effect of Termination. In the event this Agreement is terminated by
Parent or the Company as provided above, the provisions of this Agreement
shall immediately become void and of no further force and effect (this Section
9.02, and Article XI and Article XII hereof shall survive the termination of
this Agreement (other than the provisions of Section 12.19, which shall
terminate)), and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, the OP,
Merger Sub, the Company, the Securityholder Representative or the
Securityholders to one another, except for Fraud or willful breaches of this
Agreement prior to the time of such termination. For purposes of this
Agreement, the failure to consummate the Closing pursuant to, and when
required by, the terms of this Agreement shall constitute a willful breach
hereunder.

amount of any such Transfer Taxes payable in connection therewith.

(b) Tax Returns.

(i) Prior to March 15, 2020, the Company shall cause SecurCare Management, LLC

of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that relate to any Tax period ending
on or before the Closing that are due after the Closing Date. All such Tax
Returns shall be prepared on a basis that is consistent with past practice,
except to the extent such basis is inconsistent with applicable Law. The
Securityholders shall provide drafts of any such Tax Returns to Parent at
least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns. Parent shall
have the right to review and provide comments to the Securityholders with
respect to such Tax Returns, and the Securityholders shall accept all

the Securityholders do not accept any proposed comments of Parent, the parties
shall work together and cooperate to resolve any dispute regarding such Tax
Returns and proposed comments and if the parties are unable to mutually agree
on a resolution, the inclusion of such proposed comments to the Tax Returns
will be determined by a mutually agreeable third-party arbitrator, the cost of
such arbitrator to be shared equally between Parent and the Securityholders.
The Securityholders shall be responsible for, and shall promptly pay to the
Surviving Company, all Taxes payable by the Company with respect to the
Company and its assets and any of its subsidiaries attributable to any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing upon request of the Surviving Company;

any of its subsidiaries that relate to any taxable period ending after the
Closing Date (including Tax Returns for any Straddle Period).

taxable year ended December 31, 2019, the Company and the Securityholders
shall make the election provided for in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1368-1(f)(3) to cause the Company to make a deemed dividend, such that, as
of the Closing, the Company will be deemed to have had no earnings and profits
attributable to any period during which the Company did not qualify as an S
corporation.

(iv) The Parties agree that, in the case of any Straddle Period, for income
Tax purposes, the items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit, and other
items, of the Company or its subsidiaries that are allocable to the portion of
the Straddle Period that constitutes a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (and for such purpose, the Tax period of any partnership or other
pass-through entity in which the Company or its subsidiaries holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and the amount
of other Taxes of the Company or its subsidiaries attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the taxable period ending on the day before the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period.

(c) Tax Contests.

(i) Securityholders shall have the sole right to control any audit,
examination, contest, litigation or other proceeding with or against any
taxing authority (a "Tax Proceeding") that relates in whole or in part to any
Tax that is an Excluded Tax and for which the Securityholders agree to be
bound by Section 8.02(c); provided, however, that (1) Securityholders shall
inform Parent in a timely manner and in reasonable detail about the conduct of
such Tax Proceeding; (2) Securityholders shall consider in good faith any comments provided by Parent with respect to the conduct of such Tax
Proceeding; and (3) Securityholders shall not, without Parent\'s consent,
agree to any settlement with respect to any Tax Proceeding if such settlement
could adversely affect the Tax liability of any Parent Indemnitee.

(ii) Parent shall have the sole right to control, at its own expense, any Tax
Proceeding involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than any
Tax Proceeding described in Section 10.04(c)(i)).

assignees and successors shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Section 10.04 and any audit, litigation, or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other Party\'s reasonable request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

12.04 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Securityholder Representative without the prior
written consent of the non-assigning Parties; provided that Parent may assign
any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement
before or after the Closing Date to any Affiliate; provided, further, that
Parent will nonetheless remain liable for all of its obligations hereunder. 12.05 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.
Upon any such determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

12.06 References. The table of contents and the section and other headings and
subheadings contained in this Agreement and the exhibits hereto are solely for
the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the Parties, and
shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or
any exhibit hereto. All references to days (excluding Business Days) or months
shall be deemed references to calendar days or months. All references to "$"
shall be deemed references to U.S. dollars. Unless the context otherwise
requires, any reference to a "Section," "Exhibit," "Disclosure Schedule" or
"Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to a section of this Agreement, an exhibit
to this Agreement or a schedule to this Agreement, as applicable. Unless
context otherwise requires, any references to any statute, regulation, or
agreement are to such statute, regulation, or agreement as amended and
supplemented from time to time (and, in the case of a statute or regulation,
to any successor provisions). The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word
"including" or any variation thereof means "including, without limitation" and
shall not be construed to limit any general statement that it follows to the
specific or similar items or matters immediately following it. Unless the
context requires otherwise, words in this Agreement using the singular or
plural number also include the plural or singular number, respectively, and
the use of any gender herein shall be deemed to include the other genders. The
words "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and shall not simply mean "if." The term "or" has the inclusive
meaning represented by the phrase "and/or." When calculating the period of
time before which, within which or following which any act is to be done or
step taken under this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in
calculating such period will be excluded. If the last day of such period is a
non-Business Day, the period in question will end on the next succeeding
Business Day. The words "shall" and "will" shall be construed as creating a
mandatory obligation. Any Law referred to herein means such Law as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented. The phrase "ordinary course of
business" shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "consistent with past
practice" (to the extent not already so followed). The phrase "made available"
to Parent (or other similar phrases) means the information or other material
has been posted prior to the date hereof in the electronic data room
established on behalf of the Securityholders to which Parent and Parent\'s
Representatives have access.

12.07 Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule
of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The specification
of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits
attached hereto is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower
amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are not required to
be disclosed under other provisions of this Agreement (including whether such
amounts or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or within or outside of the ordinary course of business, and no Party shall use
the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any
item in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute
or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described or included in this Agreement or in any Schedule or
Exhibit is or is not required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or
items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or
outside of the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The
information contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and
Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no
information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by
any Party to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation
of Law or breach of contract).

12.08 Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules hereto may be amended or waived only in a writing signed (a) in the
case of any amendment, by Parent, the Company (or the Surviving Company
following the Closing) and the Securityholder Representative and (b) in the
case of a waiver, by the Party or Parties waiving rights hereunder; provided,
however, that after the receipt of the Company Requisite Approval, no
amendment to this Agreement shall be made which by Law requires further
approval by the shareholders of the Company without such further approval by
such Persons. No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default
thereof shall extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or
subsequent breach or default.

12.09 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein
and other documents executed in connection herewith or at the Closing contain
the complete agreement between the Parties and supersede any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or between the Parties,
written or oral, which may have related to such subject matter in any way,
including any data room agreements, bid letters, term sheets, summary issues
lists or other agreements.

12.10 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Certain provisions of this Agreement that are
intended for the benefit of the Securityholders shall be enforceable by the
Securityholder Representative on behalf of the Securityholders; provided that
no Securityholder shall have the right to directly take any action or enforce
any provision of this Agreement, it being understood and agreed that all such
actions shall be taken solely by the Securityholder Representative on behalf
of the Securityholders. In addition, the Securityholder Representative shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to enforce any rights of the Company
or the Securityholders under this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement shall be
construed to give any Person other than the Parties to this Agreement any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

12.11 Waiver of Trial by Jury. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF
ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF
THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
RELATED HERETO IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE
OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT THE PARTIES
TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY. 12.12 Parent Deliveries. Parent agrees and acknowledges that all documents or
other items delivered or made available to Parent\'s Representatives shall be
deemed to be delivered or made available, as the case may be, to Parent for
all purposes hereunder.

12.13 Delivery by Email. This Agreement and any signed agreement entered into
in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any amendments hereto or
thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of scanned pages via
electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner and respects as original
contracts and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
they were the original signed versions thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any Party hereto or to any such contract, each other Party hereto
or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other Parties. No Party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use of
email to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or contract was
transmitted or communicated through the use of email as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each such Party forever waives any such defense.
This Agreement is not binding unless and until signature pages are executed
and delivered by each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Key Persons and
the Securityholder Representative.

12.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one (1) Party,
but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

12.15 Governing Law. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the exhibits
and schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of Law
or conflict of Law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

12.16 Jurisdiction. Any suit, Action or proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought and determined exclusively
in the Delaware Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; provided that if
the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, any such suit,
Action or proceeding shall be brought exclusively in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware or any other court of the State of
Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, Action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, Action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, Action or proceeding which
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such suit, Action or proceeding may be served on any Party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of
process on such Party as provided in Section 12.03 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such Party.

12.17 Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party shall be deemed cumulative
with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy shall
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy, except as expressly set forth
herein.

12.18 No Recourse. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the Parties to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and the Securityholder Representative agrees on behalf of the Securityholders,
that this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any action, suit or
claim for breach of this Agreement may only be made against, the Parties to
this Agreement, and no Non-Recourse Party of a Party to this Agreement shall
have any liability relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions.

12.19 Specific Performance. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any Party, money damages may be
inadequate and the non-breaching Party may have no adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, the Parties agree that prior to a valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with this Agreement, such non-breaching Party shall
have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its
favor at law or in equity, to enforce its rights and the other Party\'s
obligations hereunder not only by an Action or Actions for damages but also by
an Action or Actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other
equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security).

12.20 Confidentiality. This Agreement, as well as any information related to
the Transactions (the "Confidential Information"), shall be maintained by each
Party (and each such Party shall cause its Affiliates to maintain), in strict
confidence and may not be disclosed to third parties without the prior written
consent of Parent or the Securityholder Representative (as applicable);
provided that nothing in this sentence shall limit the disclosure by the
receiving Party of any Confidential Information (a) to the extent required by
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange, or in the
case of Parent, by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
(provided, further, that, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the rules
or regulations of any stock exchange or the SEC (as applicable), the receiving
Party agrees to give Parent or the Securityholder Representative (as
applicable) prior notice of such disclosure and reasonably cooperate, at
Parent\'s or the Securityholder Representative\'s (as applicable) sole cost
and expense, with any efforts to seek confidential treatment of any such
information required by applicable Law, the rules or regulations of any stock
exchange or the SEC to be disclosed), (b) in a dispute brought by a Party in
pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its remedies under this Agreement,
and (c) to the extent that such information can be shown to have come within
the public domain through no fault of the disclosing Party in violation
hereof. This Section 12.20 shall not apply to any public announcement made in
accordance with Section 12.01.

12.21 Conflict Waiver; Attorney-Client Privilege.

(a) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its directors, members, shareholders, partners, officers,
employees and Affiliates, that Sherman and Howard L.L.C. (the "Group Companies
Counsel") has acted as counsel to the Group Companies in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) All communications between the Group Companies, on the one hand, and Group
Companies Counsel, on the other hand, occurring prior to the Closing and
relating to the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Privileged Communications") shall be deemed to be attorney-client privileged
and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely
to the Company and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent or, following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company.
Accordingly, Parent and, following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Company shall not have access to any Privileged
Communications or to the files of Group Companies Counsel relating to such
engagement from and after Closing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the Closing, (i) the Group Companies (and not Parent nor, following
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company or the
Surviving Company) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege
with respect to such engagement, and none of Parent or, following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company or the
Surviving Company shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of
Group Companies Counsel in respect of such engagement constitute property of
the client, only the Securityholder Representative (and not NSA nor, following
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company) shall
hold such property rights and (iii) Group Companies Counsel shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or
files to Parent or, following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Company or the Surviving Company by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Group Companies Counsel and the Company
or the Surviving Company or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between Parent or its Affiliates (including,
following the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Company or the Surviving Company), on the one hand, and a third party other
than any of the Group Companies, on the other hand, Parent and its Affiliates
(including, following the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Company) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications to such third party; provided,
however, that neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates (including , following
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company or the
Surviving Company) may waive such privilege without the prior written consent
of the Group Companies, collectively, excluding, following the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company or the Surviving Company,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided, further Securityholder Representative shall not permit (to the
extent it has the right to do so) the Group Companies Counsel to waive such
privilege or disclose any Privileged Communications in the context of such
third party dispute without the prior written consent of the Surviving
Company. In the event that Parent or any of its Affiliates (including,
following the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Company or the Surviving Company) is legally required by governmental Order or
otherwise legally required to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of
the Privileged Communications, to the extent (x) permitted by applicable Law,
and (y) advisable in the opinion of Parent\'s counsel, then Parent shall
immediately (and, in any event, within twenty (20) Business Days) notify the
Securityholder Representative in writing so that the Securityholder
Representative can seek a protective order.

(c) This Section 12.21 is intended for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Group Companies Counsel. This Section 12.21 shall be
irrevocable, and no term of this Section 12.21 may be amended, waived or
modified, without the prior written consent of the Group Companies Counsel.
