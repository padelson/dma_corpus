This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 23, 2008 (this
"Agreement"), is by and among LIBERTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY, a
Massachusetts stock insurance company ("Parent"), BIG APPLE MERGER
CORPORATION, a Washington corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub"), and SAFECO CORPORATION, a Washington corporation (the
"Company" and, collectively with Parent and Merger Sub, the "parties").

 

 

RECITALS

 

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

 

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
companies and shareholders to consummate the Merger upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree
as follows:

 

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER; CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS

 

 

Section 1.1   The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the WBCA, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of
the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the
Company will continue under the name "Safeco Corporation" as the surviving
corporation of the Merger under the WBCA (the "Surviving Corporation").

 

 

Section 1.2   Closing; Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of Article
VII, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or, to
the extent permitted by Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied
until the Closing, but the Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction or,
to the extent permitted by Law, waiver of those conditions), at the offices
of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP, 919 Third Avenue, New York, New York, unless
another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties. The date
on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as the
"Closing Date." Prior to the Closing, Parent shall prepare in consultation
with the Company, and on the Closing Date the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing, the articles of merger
(the "Articles of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Washington, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the WBCA (the date and time of the filing of the
Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington, or
such later time as is specified in the Articles of Merger and as is agreed to
by the parties, being the "Effective Time"), and the parties shall make all
other filings or recordings required under the WBCA in connection with
the Merger.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 1.3   Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the WBCA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

Section 1.4   Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the
Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company shall by virtue of the
Merger be amended and restated in their entirety to be identical to the
articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time and, as so amended and restated, shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time
until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and applicable
Law; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Article I of the
articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The corporate name of the
corporation (hereinafter called the "corporation") is Safeco Corporation." At
the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and
following the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with the
Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law, except
that references to Merger Sub\'s name shall be replaced by references to
"Safeco Corporation." This Section 1.4 shall be subject to the obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under Section 6.9.

 

 

Section 1.5   Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation. As of the
Effective Time, each of the directors of the Company shall resign and the
directors of Merger Sub, at the Effective Time, shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of
the Company, at the Effective Time, shall, from and after the Effective Time,
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been
duly appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Constituent Documents of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

 

Section 1.6   Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

 

 

(a) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no
par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(b) Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Company (such
shares, collectively, the "Common Stock", and each, a "Company Share")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any shares of Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(c) and any
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount
per Company Share (subject to any applicable withholding Tax specified in
Section 2.2) equal to $68.25 in cash, without interest
(the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Time, each holder of a certificate theretofore representing any such Company
Shares (each, a "Certificate") or non-certificated Company Shares represented
by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
Section 2.1(c), without interest (subject to any applicable withholding Tax
specified in Section 2.2).

 

 

 

(c) Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company, if any, or
otherwise owned by Parent or Merger Sub, or owned by any direct or indirect
Subsidiary of any such Person (other than Company Shares held in an
investment portfolio), in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall automatically be canceled and retired and cease to exist without any
conversion thereof and no consideration shall be paid in exchange therefor.

 

 

Section 1.7   Treatment of Options and Other Company Equity Awards.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company or the
appropriate Board committee shall adopt a resolution providing that, at the
Effective Time, each Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled
and extinguished, and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive
an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Merger Consideration over (B) the per share exercise price of such Option,
multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Option (which amount
shall be subject to any applicable withholding Tax specified in Section 2.2).
All payments with respect to canceled Options shall be made by the Exchange
Agent promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days after the Effective Time) from funds deposited by Parent to pay
such amounts in accordance with Section 2.1. No later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, the Company shall have taken such
actions as are necessary to cause each Option then outstanding to be vested
and exercisable subject to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company or the
appropriate Board committee shall adopt a resolution providing that, at the
Effective Time, each restricted stock right in respect of a Company Share (a
"Restricted Stock Right") shall vest in full and be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect thereof,
without interest (subject to any applicable withholding Tax specified in
Section 2.2). The holder of any Restricted Stock Right shall be paid in
accordance with Section 2.1(c) an aggregate amount of cash as such holder
would have been entitled to receive had such Restricted Stock Right been
vested in full immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the Safeco Agency
Stock Purchase Plan.

 

 

Section 1.8  Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the Common Stock is changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, combination or exchange
of shares, stock split, reverse stock split or a stock dividend or dividend
payable in any other securities or any similar transaction or any transaction
having the effect of any of the foregoing, the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Common

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Stock and the holders of Restricted Stock Rights and Options the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action and as
so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration.

 

 

 

Section 1.9   Dissenting Shares.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the holder of which (i) has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing, (ii) has demanded its rights to be paid the fair value of
such Company Shares in accordance with Section 23B.13 of the WBCA and (iii)
has not effectively withdrawn or lost its rights to be paid the fair value
of such Company Shares ("Dissenting Shares") shall be converted into or
represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration. By virtue of the
Merger, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
shall represent the right to receive only those rights provided under Section
23B.13 of the WBCA. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting
Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other
rights of a shareholder, member or equity owner of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.9, if any holder of
shares of Common Stock for which such holder has demanded dissenters\' rights
shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
the right to dissent or its dissenters\' rights, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder\'s shares of
Common Stock shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to any
applicable withholding Taxes specified in Section 2.2.

 

 

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any notice
received by the Company of any shareholder\'s intent to demand the fair value
of any shares of Common Stock, any demand received by the Company for payment
of the fair value of any Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to Section 23B.13 of the WBCA and received
by the Company which relate to any such demand for dissenters\' rights and
(ii) the opportunity to reasonably participate in negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for dissenters\' rights under Section
23B.13 of the WBCA. Unless required by applicable Law or Order, the Company
will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with

ARTICLE II

 

PAYMENT AND EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; WITHHOLDING

 

 

Section 2.1   Payment and Exchange of Certificates.

 

 

(a) Following the date of this Agreement and in any event not less than five
(5) Business Days prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the
shareholders of the Company, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") for purposes of, among other things, paying the Merger

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, Book-
Entry Shares, Options and Restricted Stock Rights, cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to which all holders
of Company Shares and Restricted Stock Rights become entitled pursuant to
Article I and the aggregate payments to which all holders of Options
become entitled pursuant to Article I (the "Aggregate Merger Consideration")
(the Aggregate Merger Consideration, and any proceeds thereof being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

 

 

 

(b) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund
as directed in writing by Parent in (i) direct obligations of the
United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and
credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for payment of
all principal and interest, and (iii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1
or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s
Corporation, respectively, or a combination of the foregoing or
in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 and, in
any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three
months. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall
be paid to and be income of Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the
cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the
payment obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder,
Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount that
is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy
such cash payment obligations.

 

 

(c) Promptly, and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days, after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent
to (i) mail to each Person who was a record holder of Company Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose Company Shares were converted
pursuant to Article I into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (A)
a form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates in order to receive payment of the Merger Consideration (which
letter of transmittal shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon actual delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof), and shall otherwise be in customary form and contain
customary provisions), and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration and (ii) pay to
each holder of Options the amount due to such holder pursuant to Section
1.7(a) in respect of such Options and to each holder of Restricted Stock
Rights the amount due to such holder pursuant to Section 1.7(b) in respect of
such Restricted Stock Rights. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), together with a
properly completed and executed letter of transmittal and any other required
documents, the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver to the holder of the
Company Shares represented by the Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof), or as otherwise directed in the letter of transmittal, the
Merger Consideration with regard to each Company Share represented by such
Certificate, less any required withholding Taxes as specified in Section 2.2,
and the Certificate shall be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued
on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of Certificates. If
payment is to be made to a Person holding a Certificate other than the Person
in whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered must be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the Person who
surrenders the Certificate must provide funds for payment of any transfer or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that all Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable. Subject to Section 1.9, after the Effective Time,
a Certificate shall represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Company Shares represented by
such Certificate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent in
order to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Article II.

 

 

 

(d) If a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will cause the Exchange Agent to accept an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen
or destroyed instead of the Certificate; provided that the Surviving
Corporation may require the Person to whom any Merger Consideration is paid,
as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, to give the Surviving
Corporation a bond in such reasonable amount as it may direct or otherwise
indemnify the Surviving Corporation in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate claimed to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

 

(e) At any time which is more than one (1) year after the Effective Time,
Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any
portion of the Exchange Fund that had been deposited with the Exchange Agent
and has not been disbursed in accordance with this Article II
(including interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in
respect of the funds made available to it), and after the Exchange Fund has
been delivered to Parent, Persons entitled to payment in accordance with this
Article II shall be entitled to look solely to Parent (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws) for payment of the Merger Consideration
upon surrender of the Certificates held by them, without any interest
thereon. Any portion of the Exchange Fund deposited with the Exchange Agent
remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Shares five (5) years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or the Exchange Agent will
be liable to any Person entitled to payment under this Article II for
any consideration which is delivered, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, to Parent in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence or to a public official or Governmental Entity pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 

(f) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not
record on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation any transfers of shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares are presented for transfer, they shall be
canceled and treated as having been surrendered for the Merger Consideration
in respect of the Company Shares represented thereby.

 

 

Section 2.2  Withholding Rights. Each of Parent and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Agreement to any holder of Company Shares, Options or Restricted Stock Rights
such amounts as it is lawfully required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state or
local Law or the Laws of any other domestic or foreign jurisdiction. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing
authority by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Company Shares, Options or Restricted Stock Rights
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

in the Company SEC Documents), or (y) set forth in the disclosure letter
delivered by the Company to Parent on or prior to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (it being agreed that
disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any section of this
Agreement or any other section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Schedule to which the relevance of such disclosure to the
applicable representation and warranty or covenant or obligation is
reasonably apparent), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:

 

 

Section 3.1   Corporate Existence and Power. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated and validly existing under the Laws of the State
of Washington and the Company and its Subsidiaries have all requisite
corporate, partnership or other similar powers and all governmental
licenses, authorizations, permits, certificates, registrations,
consents, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals required to
carry on their business as conducted on the date of this Agreement (the
"Company Permits"), except for those powers, licenses, authorizations,
permits, consents, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals
the absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, except
where the failure to be in such compliance would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is required,
except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent
true and complete copies of the Constituent Documents of the Company and each
of its Significant Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 3.2   Corporate Authorization.

 

 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute

subject, in the case of the Merger, to obtaining the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by
the holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock voting together as a
single class (the "Requisite Shareholder Vote"). The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions to which it is a party contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company,
and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary
to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions to which it is
a party contemplated hereby, except that consummation of the Merger is
subject to approval of this Agreement by the Requisite Shareholder Vote, and
to the effectiveness of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Washington.

 

 

 

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held

and declared it advisable and in the best interests of the Company to enter
into this Agreement providing for the Merger, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions to which it is a party contemplated hereby, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein and (iii) resolved, subject to
Section 6.3, to recommend approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of
the Company (such recommendation, the "Company Board Recommendation") and
that such matter be submitted for consideration at the Company Shareholders
Meeting.

 

 

(c) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming due power and authority of, and due execution and delivery by, the
other parties, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or
similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability
of equitable remedies (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) (together, the
"Bankruptcy and Equity Exception"). The approval of this Agreement by the
Requisite Shareholder Vote is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of the Company necessary to approve this Agreement or
approve the transactions to which the Company is a
party contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section 3.3  Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions to which it is a party contemplated hereby
require at or prior to the Closing no consent or approval by, or filing with,
any Governmental Entity, other than (a) the filing of the Articles of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington and appropriate
documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company
is qualified to do business, (b) compliance with any applicable requirements
of the HSR Act, (c) compliance with any applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or
state securities Laws or "blue sky" Laws, (d) compliance with any

Section 4.3(e)), (g) those consents, approvals or filings as may be required
as a result of the business or identity of Parent or any of its Affiliates
and (h) any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other consents, approvals or filings the failure of which to be obtained or
made would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

 

 

Section 3.4   Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement do not and the consummation of the transactions
to which it is a party contemplated hereby will not, (a) violate or conflict
with or result in any breach of any provision of the Constituent Documents of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (b) assuming receipt of the Requisite
Shareholder Vote and compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.3
and Section 4.3 (and assuming the accuracy of Section 4.3(e)), violate
or conflict with any provision of any applicable Law, Order or Company
Permit, (c) violate or conflict with or result in any breach or constitute a
default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default, under, or cause the termination, cancellation,
acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the loss of any
benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled, or
require consent by any Person under any Material Contract or (d) result in
the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except in the case of clause (b), (c) or (d), as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Securities"). As of the date of this Agreement, there are no binding

or otherwise acquire any of the Company Securities.

 

 

 

Section 3.6  Subsidiaries. Section 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule

the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such

Section 3.7 [Reserved].

 

 

Section 3.8  Company SEC Filings, etc.

 

 

(a) The Company has timely filed all reports, schedules, forms, registration
statements and other documents required to be filed by the Company with the
SEC since January 1, 2006 (together with any documents furnished during such
period by the Company to the SEC on a voluntary basis on Current Reports
on Form 8-K and any reports, schedules, forms, registration statements and
other documents required to be filed with the SEC subsequent to the date
hereof, collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). Each of the Company
SEC Documents, as amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied (and
each Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the date hereof will comply)
in all material respects with, to the extent in effect at the time of filing
or furnishing, the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC
Documents when filed or furnished or, if amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of such amendment, contained, or with respect to
Company SEC Documents filed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsequent to the date hereof, will contain, any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

 

 

(b) The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The
Company (i) maintains disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning
of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\'s rules and forms,
including that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files and submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to management of the Company as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) has disclosed, based upon
the most recent (prior to the date of this Agreement) evaluation by the
chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company of
the Company\'s internal control over financial reporting, to its auditors
and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (A) all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of the Company\'s internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect its ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Company\'s internal control over
financial reporting. The Company has made available to Parent any such
material disclosure made by management to the Company\'s independent auditors
and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company since
January 1, 2006.

 

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity, on the
other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a)
of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or intended effect
of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in the Company SEC Documents.

 

 

Section 3.9  Company Financial Statements. The consolidated financial
statements (including all related notes thereto) of the Company included
in the Company SEC Documents (if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment filed prior to the date of this Agreement) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows
for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to the absence of
information or notes not required by GAAP to be included in interim financial
statements) in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case of the unaudited
statements, as permitted by the SEC)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto).

 

 

 

Section 3.10  Company SAP Statements. As used herein, the term "Company
SAP Statements" means the statutory statements of each of the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries as filed with the insurance departments in their
respective jurisdiction of domicile for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
2006. Each of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries has filed or submitted
all Company SAP Statements required to be filed with or submitted to
the insurance departments of their respective jurisdictions of domicile on
forms prescribed or permitted by such department, except for such failures to
file or submit which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company SAP
Statements were prepared in all material respects in conformity with SAP
applied on a consistent basis for the periods covered thereby (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and the Company SAP
Statements fairly present, in all material respects, the statutory financial
position of such Company Insurance Subsidiaries as at the respective
dates thereof and the statutory results of operations of such Company
Insurance Subsidiaries for the respective periods then ended. No material
deficiency has been asserted in writing with respect to any Company
SAP Statement by the domiciliary state insurance department of such filing
Company Insurance Subsidiary that has not been remedied. The annual statutory
balance sheets and income statements included in the Company SAP Statements
have been, where required by applicable Insurance Law, audited by an
independent accounting firm of recognized national or
international reputation.

 

 

Section 3.11  Information Supplied. The Proxy Statement will not, at the
date it is first mailed to the shareholders of the Company and at the time of
the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that, in each
case, no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to
statements made therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. The
Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act.

 

 

Section 3.12  Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December 31,
2007, there has not been any event, change, circumstance or effect that has
had or is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 3.13  No Undisclosed Material Liabilities. There are no liabilities
or obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any nature,
whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise,
in each case, that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on
a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries other than:
(a) liabilities or obligations reflected or reserved against in the
Company\'s audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 included
in the Company SEC Documents or in the notes thereto; (b) insurance claims or
related litigation or arbitration arising in the ordinary course of business
since December 31, 2007; (c) liabilities or obligations that were incurred
since December 31, 2007 in the ordinary course of business; (d) liabilities
or obligations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Adverse Effect; and (e) liabilities or obligations arising or incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

Section 3.14  Compliance with Laws.

 

 

(a) Since January 1, 2006, the business and operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries have been conducted in compliance with all applicable Laws
(including Insurance Laws), except where the failure to so conduct such
business and operations would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(b) All of the Company Permits of each Company Insurance Subsidiary
conducting insurance operations are in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms and there is no proceeding or investigation to which the
Company or any Company Insurance Subsidiary is subject before a Governmental
Entity that is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in
writing that would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation,
failure to renew or suspension of, or placement of a restriction on, any
such Company Permits, except where the failure to be in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms, revocation, failure to renew,
suspension or restriction would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(c) There is no proceeding to which the Company or any Company Insurance
Subsidiary is subject before any Governmental Entity pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing regarding whether any of
the Company Insurance Subsidiaries has violated any applicable
Insurance Laws, nor to the knowledge of the Company, any investigation by
any Governmental Entity pending or threatened in writing with respect to
possible violations of any applicable Insurance Laws, except
for proceedings or investigations relating to violations or possible
violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2006,
each Company Insurance Subsidiary has filed all material reports required
to be filed by it with its domiciliary state insurance department or
such failure to file has been remedied. Except as required by applicable Law
and the Company Permits maintained by the Company Insurance Subsidiaries,
there are no written agreements, memoranda of understanding, commitment
letters or similar undertakings binding on the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries to which the Company or any Company Insurance Subsidiary is a
party, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity is a party or addressee,
on the other hand, or Orders specifically with respect to the Company or any
Company Insurance Subsidiary, that (i) limit in any material respect the
ability of any of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries to issue
insurance policies under its Company Permits, (ii) impose any requirements
on the Company or any of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries in respect of
risk-based capital requirements that materially increase or modify the risk-
based capital requirements imposed under applicable Insurance Laws, (iii)
relate to the ability of any of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries to pay
dividends or (iv) restrict in any material respect the conduct of business of
the Company or any of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries.

 

 

Section 3.15  Litigation. There is no action, suit, investigation, claim,
complaint, demand, summons, cease and desist letter, subpoena, injunction,

Subsidiary in connection with which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
an indemnification obligation pursuant to its Constituent Documents or a
written agreement, before any Governmental Entity (other than insurance
claims litigation or arbitration arising in the ordinary course of business),
which, if determined or resolved adversely in accordance with the
plaintiff\'s or claimant\'s demands, would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the
date of this Agreement, there is no Order outstanding against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries which would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect

Section 3.16  Insurance Matters.

 

 

(a) To the knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, all ceded
reinsurance treaties or agreements to which any Company Insurance Subsidiary
is a party or under which any Company Insurance Subsidiary has any existing
material rights, obligations or liabilities (the "Company Reinsurance
Agreements") are in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
Neither the Company nor any Company Insurance Subsidiary is in material
default as to any material provision thereof. Since January 1, 2006 through
the third Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any Company Insurance Subsidiary has received any written notice
to the effect that (i) the financial condition of any reinsurer party to any
such agreement is materially impaired with the result that a
default thereunder may reasonably be anticipated or (ii) there is a material
dispute with respect to any material amounts recoverable by the Company
Insurance Subsidiary pursuant to any Company Reinsurance Agreement. Since
January 1, 2005, no Company Insurance Subsidiary has entered into any
reinsurance treaty or agreement under which it has assumed any material
liabilities of any Person.

 

 

(b) With respect to any Company Reinsurance Agreement for which any Company
Insurance Subsidiary has taken credit for reinsurance ceded on its Company SAP
Statement, (i) there has been no separate written or oral agreements between
any of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and the assuming reinsurer that
would under any circumstances reduce, limit, mitigate or otherwise affect any
actual or potential loss to the parties under any such Company
Reinsurance Agreement, other than inuring contracts that are explicitly
defined in any such Company Reinsurance Agreement, (ii) for each such Company
Reinsurance Agreement entered into, renewed or amended on or after January 1,
2006, for which risk transfer is not reasonably considered to be self-
evident, documentation concerning the economic intent of the transaction and
the risk transfer analysis evidencing the proper accounting treatment, as
required by SSAP No. 62, is available for review by the domiciliary state
insurance departments for each of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries, (iii)
from and after January 1, 2006, each of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries
complies and has complied in all material respects with all of the
requirements set forth in SSAP No. 62 and (iv) from and after January 1,
2006, each of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries has and has had appropriate
controls in place to monitor the use of reinsurance and comply with the
provisions of SSAP No. 62.

(c) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has made available
to Parent a true and complete copy of all actuarial reports prepared by
actuaries, independent or otherwise, with respect to any Company Insurance
Subsidiary since January 1, 2006, and all material attachments, addenda,
supplements and modifications thereto (the "Company Actuarial Analyses"). To
the knowledge of the Company, each Company Actuarial Analysis was based upon,
in all material respects, an accurate inventory of policies in force for the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be, at the relevant
time of preparation and was prepared in conformity with generally accepted
actuarial principles in effect at such time, consistently applied (except as
may be noted therein).

 

 

(d) Except for regular periodic assessments in the ordinary course of
business or assessments based on developments that are publicly known within
the insurance industry, as of the date of this Agreement, no material claim
or material assessment is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened in writing against any Company Insurance Subsidiary by any state
insurance guaranty association in connection with such association\'s fund
relating to insolvent insurers.

 

 

(e) Since January 1, 2006, to the knowledge of the Company, (i) salaried
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and each other person,
who, in each of the foregoing cases, is performing the duties of
insurance producer, agency, agent or managing general agent for the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, "Company Producers"), at the time
such Company Producer wrote, sold, or produced business for or on behalf of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary that requires a License, was duly
licensed and appointed as required by applicable Law, in the particular
jurisdiction in which such Company Producer wrote, sold or
produced business and (ii) each of the agency agreements and
appointments between the Company Producers, including as subagents under
the Company\'s affiliated insurance agency, and the Company and any Company
Subsidiary, is valid and binding and in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms, except in the case of clause (i) or (ii), as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, as of the
date of this Agreement, no Company Producer has been since January 1, 2006,
or is currently, in violation (or with or without notice or lapse of time or
both, would be in violation) of any term or provision of any Law applicable
to the writing, sale or production of insurance or other business for the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for such violations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, as of the
date of this Agreement, no Company Producer individually accounting for 1%
or more of the total gross premiums of all Company Subsidiaries for the year
ended December 31, 2007 has notified the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that such Company Producer will be unable in any material respect
or unwilling to continue its relationship as a Company Producer with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary within twelve months after the date hereof.

 

 

Section 3.17  Policy Reserves. The policy reserves of the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries recorded in their respective Company SAP Statements, as of
December 31, 2007, (a) have been computed in all material respects in
accordance with generally accepted actuarial standards in effect on such date
and (b) were in compliance in all material respects with the requirements for
policy reserves established by the domiciliary insurance regulatory authority
of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

such Company Insurance Subsidiary; provided, however, that it is acknowledged
and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub that the Company is not making any
representation or warranty in this Section 3.17 as to the adequacy or
sufficiency of reserves.

 

 

 

Section 3.18  Title to Properties; Absence of Liens.

 

 

(a) Section 3.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all real property owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Owned Real Property"), and includes the address of such
Owned Real Property. The Company or one of its Subsidiaries has good

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Owned Real Property is not subject
to any material Liens (other then Permitted Liens).

 

 

(b) Section 3.18(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all real property leased to or by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries providing for an annual rent of more than $250,000

Subsidiaries has in all material respects a valid leasehold interest in all
Leased Real Property, in each case as to such leasehold interest, free and
clear of all material Liens (other than Permitted Liens).

 

 

Section 3.19  Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Board of Directors of the
Company has received an opinion from Morgan Stanley and Co.
Incorporated ("Morgan Stanley"), dated as of the date of this Agreement and
addressed to the Board of Directors of the Company to the effect that, as
of the date hereof and based upon and subject to the limitations,
qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration
to be received by the holders of Company Shares pursuant to this Agreement
is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of Company Shares
(other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, except in the case of
Company Shares held in investment portfolios of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries). The Company has been authorized by Morgan Stanley to
include such opinion in its entirety in the Proxy Statement.

 

 

Section 3.20  Taxes.

 

 

(a) All material Tax Returns required by applicable Law to be filed with any
Taxing Authority by, or on behalf of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
have been duly filed when due (including extensions) in accordance with all
applicable Laws, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in
all material respects.

 

 

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has duly and timely paid or has
duly and timely withheld and remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority all
material Taxes due and payable, or, where payment is not yet due,

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to which the applicable period for assessment under applicable Law,
after giving effect to extensions or waivers, has expired.

 

 

 

(d) There is no claim, audit, action, suit, request for written ruling,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened in writing against or with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax or Tax Asset which (except in the case
of a request for a written ruling) if determined adversely would be expected
to result in a material Tax deficiency.

 

 

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying
for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two (2) years
prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution that would
otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with this
Agreement.

 

 

(f) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have withheld all material
amounts required to have been withheld by them in connection with amounts
paid or owed to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder
or any other third party; such withheld amounts were either duly paid to the
appropriate Taxing Authority or set aside in accounts for such purpose. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries have reported such withheld amounts to
the appropriate Taxing Authority and to each such employee, independent
contractor, creditor, shareholder or any other third party, as required
under applicable Law.

 

 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is liable for material
Taxes of any Person (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) as a result
of being (i) a transferee or successor of such Person, (ii) a member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group that includes such Person
as a member or (iii) a party to a tax sharing, tax indemnity or
tax allocation agreement or any other agreement to indemnify such Person.

actuarial study of any pension, disability, post-employment life or medical
benefits provided under any such Company Benefit Plan and (vii) statements or
other communications regarding withdrawal or other multiemployer plan
liabilities (or similar liabilities pertaining to any non-U.S. employee
benefit plan sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, if any).

 

 

 

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code, and the trust (if any) forming a part thereof, has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS that the Company Benefit Plan is
so qualified, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no existing
circumstances or any events that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of any such plan in a manner which
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Benefit Plan has been
administered and operated in accordance with its terms and with
applicable Law, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their ERISA

sponsored, maintained, contributed to or had any liability in respect of any
pension plan subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of
ERISA or any similar provisions of non-U.S. Law.

 

 

(d) There are no claims pending, or to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened in writing with respect to any of the Company Benefit Plans by
any employee or otherwise involving any such plan or the assets of any such
plan (other than routine claims for benefits), except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(e) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or is a "multiple employer plan" within the
meaning of Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has at any time during the last six (6) years contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any such type of plan.

 

 

(f) The consummation of the transactions to which the Company is a
party contemplated hereby will not, either alone or in combination with
another event, (i) entitle any current or former director, officer or employee
of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay,
unemployment compensation or any other payment, (ii) result in any payment
becoming due, accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount of compensation due to any such director, officer or employee, (iii)
result in any forgiveness of indebtedness, trigger any funding obligation
under any Company Benefit Plan or impose any restrictions or limitations on
the Company\'s rights to administer, amend or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan or (iv) result in any payment (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) to any "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) that would reasonably
be construed, individually or in combination with any other such payment,
to constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1)
of the Code). No person is entitled to receive an additional payment
(including any tax gross up or other payment) from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result of the imposition of the excise tax required by

any formal grievance procedure, arbitration or litigation and there is
no representation petition pending or, to the knowledge of the

Adverse Effect.

cost, liability or obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under

binding obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries party thereto, subject
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, except (i) to the extent they have
previously expired or terminated in accordance with their terms and (ii) for
any failures to be valid and binding which would not, individually or in

the knowledge of the Company, any other party is in breach of or in default
under any Material Contract, and no event has occurred that, with the lapse
of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a default

a Company Material Adverse Effect.

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the
Company on or prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the
"Parent Disclosure Schedule") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in
any section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any section of this Agreement or any other section
or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Schedule to which the relevance of
such disclosure to the applicable representation and warranty or covenant or
obligation is reasonably apparent), Parent and Merger Sub represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:

 

 

Section 4.1  Corporate Existence and Power. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has

approvals required to carry on its business as conducted on the date of
this Agreement (the "Parent Permits"), except for those powers,
licenses, authorizations, permits, consents, franchises, variances,
exemptions, orders and approvals the absence of which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms
of the Parent Permits, except where the failure to be in such compliance
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent is duly qualified to do business as
a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
such qualification is required, except for those jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 4.2  Corporate Authorization.

 

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub have all necessary corporate or other
similar power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform
its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions to which it is

and the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions to
which it is a party contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or other similar action on the part of Parent and
Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions to which it is a party contemplated hereby. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming due power and authority of, and due execution and delivery by, the
Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 

 

 

(b) The respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub, each at a
meeting duly called and held and at which a quorum of directors was present,
have unanimously (i) approved and declared it advisable and in the best
interests of Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to enter into this
Agreement providing for the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein and (ii) approved the execution, delivery and
performance by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions to which Parent or Merger Sub,
as the case may be, is a party contemplated hereby, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 

 

(c) No vote or other action of any members or Affiliates of Parent or the
holders of any class or series of capital stock of any Subsidiary of
Parent (including Merger Sub) is required by Law, the Constituent Documents
of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or otherwise in order for Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions to which they are a party
contemplated hereby. Parent, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub as of the
date of this Agreement, has approved this Agreement.

 

 

Section 4.3  Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery
and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the
consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions to which it
is a party contemplated hereby require at or prior to the Closing no consent

filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Washington and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of
other states in which Parent and Merger Sub are qualified to do business, (b)

with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and
any other applicable federal or state securities Laws or "blue sky" Laws,

filings under Insurance Laws as set forth in Section 4.3 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule (the "Parent Insurance Approvals" and, with the Company
Insurance Approvals, the "Transaction Approvals"), (f) the Company Insurance
Approvals (assuming the accuracy and completeness of Section 3.3(e)), (g)
those consents, approvals or filings as may be required as a result of the
business or identity of the Company or any of its Affiliates and (h) any
other consents, approvals or filings the failure of which to be obtained or
made would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 4.4  Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement do not, and the consummation by each
of Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions to which it is a party
contemplated hereby will not, (a) violate or conflict with or result in any
breach of any provision of the Constituent Documents of Parent or the
Constituent Documents of Merger Sub, (b) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 3.3 (and assuming the accuracy of Section
3.3) and Section 4.3, violate or conflict with any provision of any

proceeding or investigation to which Parent or any such Parent

be expected to result in the revocation, failure to renew or suspension of,
or placement of a restriction on, any such Parent Permits, except where the

revocation, failure to renew, suspension or restriction would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a

knowledge of Parent, any investigation by any Governmental Entity pending or

violations or possible violations which would not individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2006, each Parent Insurance Subsidiary has

state insurance department or such failure to file has been remedied.

the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries, there are no written agreements, memoranda
of understanding, commitment letters or similar undertakings binding on the
Parent Insurance Subsidiaries to which Parent or any Parent Insurance

Parent or any Parent Insurance Subsidiary, that (i) limit in any material
respect the ability of any of the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries to issue

the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries before any Governmental Entity, (other than insurance
claims litigation or arbitration arising in the ordinary course of
business), that, if determined or resolved adversely in accordance with the
plaintiff\'s demands, would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no

shall prepare (with Parent\'s reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC
the proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time,

relating to the Company Shareholders Meeting. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement
cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after such filing. Parent
shall furnish to the Company all information as may be reasonably requested
by the Company in connection with any such action and the preparation,
filing and mailing of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable Law, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the SEC or its staff advises that it has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement or that the Company may commence mailing the
Proxy Statement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of the Company.
No filing of, or amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement shall be made
by the Company, and no response to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect thereto shall be submitted by the Company, without providing Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving due
consideration to inclusion in the Proxy Statement or any such response
comments reasonably proposed by Parent. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, mailed to the shareholders of the Company.
The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of

SEC and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or

Section 6.2  Shareholders Meeting; Company Board Recommendation. As promptly
as reasonably practicable after the SEC or its staff advises that it has no
further comments on the Proxy Statement or that the Company may commence
mailing the Proxy Statement, the Company, acting through its Board of
Directors, and in accordance with applicable Law and the rules
and regulations of NYSE, shall (a) subject to Section 6.3(f), duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the shareholders of the Company for
the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote (the
"Company Shareholders Meeting"); provided, however, that the Company shall be
permitted to delay or postpone convening the Company Shareholders Meeting if
in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof (after consultation with its outside legal advisors) such
delay or postponement of the Company Shareholders Meeting is consistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (b) subject to Section 6.3(d)
and Section 6.3(f), include in the Proxy Statement the Company
Board Recommendation.

 

 

Section 6.3  No Solicitation.

directors, officers and employees to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its other Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal. Except as
permitted by Section 6.3(b), the Company shall not, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and employees not to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause its other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate, any Takeover
Proposal or the making or consummation thereof or (ii) enter into, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions (except to notify such Person of
the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.3) or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public material information in
connection with, any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company shall be permitted to terminate,
amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce any provision of any "standstill" or
similar obligation of any Person if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company
agrees that any material violations of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.3(a) by any Representative of the Company shall be deemed to be a
breach by the Company.

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of the second sentence of Section 6.3(a),
at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote, in response to
a written Takeover Proposal received after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement which did not arise as a result of a material breach of the
Company\'s obligations under Section 6.3(a), (A) the Company and
its Representatives may contact such Person making such Takeover Proposal
(and its representatives) solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof
and (B) if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal, the Company and its Representatives may (1)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its representatives), provided that
(A) prior to so furnishing such information the Company has entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such Person on terms not less restrictive in
the aggregate to such Person than the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement are to Parent, its Affiliates and their respective personnel and
representatives and (B) all such information has previously been provided or
made available to Parent or its Representatives or is provided or made
available to Parent or its Representatives prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person and (2) participate in

Company Board Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) approve, adopt or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any Takeover
Proposal (any action described in these clauses (i), (ii) or (iii)
being referred to as a "Recommendation Withdrawal"), or (iv) allow the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement, or other similar Contract (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.3(b)) providing for, with
respect to, or in connection with, any Takeover Proposal; provided, however,
that (A) the delivery by the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company
or any committee thereof of any notice specified in Section 6.3(e) shall not
be deemed to be or constitute a Recommendation Withdrawal and (B) the
provision of factual information by the Company to its shareholders shall not
be deemed to be or constitute a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Recommendation Withdrawal so long as the disclosure through which such
factual information is conveyed, taken as a whole, is not contrary to or
materially inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation.

 

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.3(c), at any time prior to
obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote, and subject in each case to the
prior compliance with Section 6.3(e), (i) the Board of Directors of the
Company may make a Recommendation Withdrawal if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; or (ii)
without limiting the effect of the Section 6.3(c) proviso and Section
6.3(d)(i) and the rights provided for thereunder, in response to a written
Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) and this Section 6.3(d)(ii) and,
concurrently with such termination, may enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company
shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) and this
Section 6.3(d)(ii), and any such purported termination shall be void and of
no force or effect, unless the Company pays to Parent the fee
payable pursuant to Section 8.3(c) prior to or concurrently with
such termination.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of the Company may not make a Recommendation Withdrawal or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) and Section
6.3(d)(ii), unless (i) if such Recommendation Withdrawal is not being made as
a result of a Superior Proposal, the Company shall have provided to Parent
two (2) Business Days prior written notice advising Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefor or (ii) if such Recommendation Withdrawal or termination is
being made as a result of a Superior Proposal, (A) the Company shall have
provided to Parent four (4) Business Days prior written notice advising
Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such action
and specifying the reasons therefor as well as the material terms and
conditions of any Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person
making such Superior Proposal and copies of all documents or correspondence
evidencing such Superior Proposal), (B) during such four (4) Business Day
period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have engaged in good
faith negotiations with Parent regarding any amendment to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and (C) such Takeover Proposal continues
to constitute (in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors) a
Superior Proposal.

 

 

(f) Unless this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(ii), or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), and, in each case,
subject to Section 6.2, (i) the obligation of the Company to call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting and to hold
a vote of the shareholders of the Company on the approval of this Agreement
and the Merger at the Company Shareholders Meeting shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission to it of any Takeover Proposal (whether or not a Superior
Proposal), or by a Recommendation Withdrawal, and (ii) if the Company makes a
Recommendation Withdrawal pursuant to Section 6.3(d)(i), (A) the Company
shall nevertheless submit this Agreement and the Merger to a vote of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

shareholders of the Company and (B) the Proxy Statement and any and all
accompanying materials may include appropriate disclosure with respect
to such Recommendation Withdrawal.

 

 

 

(g) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in the other
provisions of this Section 6.3, the Company shall as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within 24 hours after receipt) advise Parent orally and
in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any
such Takeover Proposal (including any material changes thereto) and the
identity of the Person making the Takeover Proposal. The Company shall
thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of
the status of any such Takeover Proposal (including any material change to
the terms thereof).

 

 

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to
the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any
disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law or (iii) informing any Person
of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 6.3; provided
that any Recommendation Withdrawal may only be made in accordance with
Section 6.3(d); it being understood that a "stop, look and listen"
communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the shareholders of
the Company) shall not be deemed to be or constitute a Recommendation
Withdrawal.

 

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

 

"Takeover Proposal" means any proposal or offer from any Person (other than
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) relating to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in
one transaction or a series of related transactions, of assets (including
equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) or businesses that
constitute 20% or more of the assets or account for 20% or more of the net
income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more
of any class of equity securities of the Company, (ii) any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or group of
Persons beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of
the Company, or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case, pursuant to which any Person or the shareholders of any Person would
own 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or of any
resulting parent company of the Company, in each case other than the
transactions contemplated hereby;

 

 

"Superior Proposal" means a Takeover Proposal (with all references to "20% or
more" in the definition of Takeover Proposal being deemed to be references to
"more than 50%") made in writing that is on terms that the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith (after consulting with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into account, among other things,
all legal, financial and other aspects of the Takeover Proposal and the
Person making the Takeover Proposal, is more favorable to the shareholders of
the Company than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

transactions contemplated hereby (including any written offer by Parent
(capable of acceptance by the Company) to amend this Agreement which is
received prior to the applicable determination by the Company Board of
Directors that a Superior Proposal exists).

 

 

 

Section 6.4  Access to Information. The Company shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, afford the Representatives of Parent reasonable
access during normal business hours to the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
properties, books, records, Contracts and personnel, and shall furnish, and
shall cause to be furnished, as promptly as reasonably practicable to Parent
(a) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed, furnished,
published or announced by it during such period pursuant to the requirements
of federal or state securities Laws or any Governmental Entity and (b) all
other information concerning the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided that the
Company may restrict the foregoing access to those Persons who have entered
into or are bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company and to the
extent required by applicable Law. All such access shall be subject to
reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time with respect to
the provision of privileged communications or any applicable
confidentiality agreement with any Person. In conducting any inspection of
any properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and
its Representatives shall not (i) interfere with the business of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries conducted at such property or (ii) damage any
property or any portion thereof. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and its
Representatives shall not have the right to conduct environmental testing or
sampling at any of the facilities or properties of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. All information obtained pursuant to this Section
6.4 shall continue to be governed by the Confidentiality Agreement which
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. No
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall affect the representations
and warranties or conditions to the obligations of the parties contained
herein.

 

 

Section 6.5  Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws and
regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as

later than the Outside Date), including (i) preparing and filing as promptly
as practicable all documents to effect all necessary applications, notices,
petitions, filings and other documents and to obtain as promptly
as practicable all consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders,

or advisable to make all necessary filings and obtain all such

authorizations, approvals and permits (including providing all necessary
information and documentary material and providing personnel as necessary to
attend any regulatory meetings, hearings or other proceedings). In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub agrees to make, as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement and in any event within twenty five (25)
days of the date of this Agreement, (A) an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act, (B) appropriate filings
required by the Transaction Approvals and (C) all other necessary filings
with any other Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to supply as

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be reasonably requested pursuant to such requirements and to use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and the receipt of the
Transaction Approvals to occur in the most expeditious manner practicable.
The Company and Parent will each request early termination of the waiting
period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act.

 

 

 

(b) To the extent permissible under applicable Law or any rule, regulation
or restriction of any Governmental Entity, each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall, in connection with the efforts referenced above to obtain
all requisite approvals, clearances and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or any other approval of a Governmental
Entity (including the Transaction Approvals), use its reasonable best efforts
to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other party in connection with any
filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by any private party, (ii) keep
the other parties apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of
the transactions contemplated hereby and promptly inform the other parties of
any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to,
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal
Trade Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental Entity and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
any private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the other parties, or the other parties\'
legal counsel, to review any communication given by it to the DOJ, the FTC
or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by any
private party, with any other Person (it being understood that each party
shall have the right to review in advance, subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, all of the information relating to
such party, and any of its respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any
filing made with, or materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity, with respect to this Agreement or the Merger),
(iv) consult with the other parties in advance of any meeting, conference,
conference call, discussion or communication with, the DOJ, the FTC or any
such other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by any
private party, with any other Person and (v) to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other parties the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings, conferences, conference calls,
discussions and communications.

 

 

(c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any applicable Law or if any suit is instituted by
any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any applicable Law, each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts
to resolve any such objections or challenges as such Governmental Entity or
private party may have to such transactions under such applicable Law so as
to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby on the terms
set forth in this Agreement as soon as reasonably possible after the date of
this Agreement (and in any event no later than the Outside Date). Without
limiting any other provision hereof, each of Parent and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any decree, order or judgment that would restrain, prevent or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, on or before
the Outside Date, including by defending through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in any court by any Person, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each
and every material 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

impediment that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, so as to enable the
consummation of the Merger to occur as soon as reasonably possible after the
date of this Agreement (and in any event no later than the Outside Date).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall take all
actions, including (A) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture
or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, or effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting obligations and commitments to the communities in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries conduct business and (C) otherwise
taking or committing to take actions or agreeing to any restrictions,
limitations or conditions that limit Parent\'s or its Subsidiaries\', or the
Surviving Corporation\'s or its Subsidiaries\', freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its
Subsidiaries\' businesses, product lines or assets, in each case, as may be
required in order to obtain any Transaction Approval, or to avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order or commencement of any action,
suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the obtaining of the Transaction Approvals or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent shall not be
required to take any actions pursuant to this Section 6.5 which if undertaken
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have (1) a
Company Material Adverse or (2) a Parent Material Adverse Effect (it being
agreed that for purposes of this clause (2) a "Parent Material
Adverse Effect" shall be deemed to occur at the level of materiality at
which the event, change, circumstance or effect in question, if it were an
effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries instead of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, would constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect (clause (1)
or (2), a "Regulatory Material Adverse Effect").

 

 

Section 6.6  Employee Matters.

 

 

(a) Until the second anniversary of the Effective Time (the
"Benefits Continuation Period"), the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or
cause to be provided, for those employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
who continue as employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries during all or a portion of the Benefits Continuation Period (the
"Continuing Employees"), compensation (including base salary, bonus and
other cash-based incentive compensation and the value of equity-based
incentive compensation) and employee benefits that in the aggregate (with
any bonus or other incentive compensation measured at target for this
purpose) shall not be any less favorable than the compensation and
employee benefits provided by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary to
the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the date of this Agreement
(excluding, except as provided in Section 6.6(b)(iv) below, retiree medical
benefits). The parties acknowledge and agree that the Continuing Employees
will not participate in stock-based compensation plans or programs
following the Effective Time. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a
guarantee of employment for any current or former employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or other than as provided in any
applicable employment agreement or other Contract, to restrict the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate any such employee or to give
any person any right to any specific terms or conditions of employment.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall (i) waive any applicable pre-existing
condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements in any replacement or successor welfare benefit plan of
the Surviving Corporation (except for the short and long term disability
benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates, which
plans, however, will recognize prior service for purposes of meeting the time
requirements in those plans\' preexisting condition exclusions; provided,
however, any such preexisting condition exclusion shall not apply to preclude
a Continuing Employee who had previously received disability benefits under a
Company disability plan prior to the Effective Time from receiving coverage
for the same condition (as determined using the same criteria as the Company
disability plan) following the Effective Time) that a Continuing Employee is
eligible to participate in following the Effective Time to the extent such
exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by,
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated, (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent
such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements, and (iii) except in connection with retiree medical benefits
which shall be treated in accordance with clause (iv) below, recognize
service prior to the Effective Time with the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting and
level of benefits (but not for purposes of benefits accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan or levels of benefits or entitlement
to eligibility or coverage under any post-retirement medical plan) to
the same extent such service was recognized by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in
any duplication of benefits for the same period of service, and (iv)
with respect to any medical plan of the Surviving Corporation which
provides post-retirement coverage (other than Company Benefit Plans in which
such employee participated prior to the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation will recognize service only for periods of an employee\'s
service with the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time except that service prior to the Effective Time shall
be credited to Eligible Persons (as defined below) with respect to Parent\'s
or its Affiliates pre- and post-age 65 retiree health program and life
insurance. Such Eligible Persons shall be eligible to participate, following
termination of employment with the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, in a retiree health and life insurance program. In addition,
to the extent that such an Eligible Person is or, upon continued employment,
would become entitled to cost sharing under such retiree health and life
insurance program, cost sharing will be provided under the program of Parent
or its Affiliates to allow for a substantially comparable benefit to such
Eligible Person. "Eligible Persons" shall mean (x) individuals who
retired from the Company on or after January 1, 2004 with 10 or more years of
service and (y) Continuing Employees who retire on or after the Effective
Time, who, in the case of either (x) or (y): (A)(1) were hired by the Company
prior to January 1, 2004, (2) were age 36 or older as of December 31, 2004,
(3) were or are, as the case may be, age 55 or older on the applicable
retirement date, (4) have years of service at retirement from the Company and
are an age that total at least 75 and (5) were or are a participant in the
Company\'s medical plan on the applicable retirement date or (B) are former
ASI employees who were age 50 or older on December 31, 1998 and had or have
at least 10 years of service on the applicable retirement date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.6(b) shall limit the
right of Parent and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any such retiree health and life insurance
program following the Effective Time; provided, however, that any amendments,
alterations, modifications, or terminations with respect to any such retiree
health and life insurance program shall be applied in a consistent manner to
Eligible Persons and any Parent retirees who are eligible for coverage under
Parent retiree health and life insurance plans.

 

 

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing
between Parent and a Company employee, Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its
terms (including any rights of amendment, modification or termination
provided therein), (i) each existing employment, change in control, severance
and termination protection plan or agreement between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee, (ii) all obligations
in effect as of the Effective Time under any equity-based, bonus, bonus
deferral and vacation plans, programs or agreements of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and (iii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective Time
pursuant to outstanding retention or equity-based plans, programs or
agreements, and all vested and accrued benefits under any employee benefit,
employment compensation or similar plans, programs, agreements or
arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(d) With respect to matters described in this Section 6.6 (and the matters
described in Section 1.7), the Company shall consult with Parent (and
consider in good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending any material
notices or other material communication materials to its employees or former
employees. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall provide Parent with reasonable access to such employees and
contact information for former employees for purposes of Parent providing
reasonable notices or other communication materials regarding Parent
compensation and benefit plans and the matters described in this (and the
matters described in Section 1.7), provided that such notices or other
communication materials are reasonably approved in advance by the Company.

 

 

(e) If and to the extent not paid by the Company prior to the Closing, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay within ten (10)
Business Days following the Closing Date, to each Person who, as of
immediately prior to the Closing, was eligible to and participated in the
Leadership Performance Plan, Sales Incentive Plan, Surety Plan or the Success
Sharing Plan (each an "Eligible Company Employee"), the amount that would
have been payable to such Eligible Company Employee for the
performance period ending December 31, 2008, determined as if all Company,
individual and other performance targets established under such plan in
respect of such period were achieved at target, prorated for the performance
period beginning January 1, 2008 and ending on the Closing Date.

 

 

(f) The Company shall adopt a retention program for key employees prior
to the Closing in accordance with Section 6.6(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Continuing Employee
who terminates employment during the period ending on the second anniversary
of the Effective Time shall be entitled to severance pay and benefits no less
favorable than the severance pay and benefits such Continuing Employee would
have been entitled to pursuant to the severance plans and arrangements set
forth on Section 6.6(g)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule had such

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

termination of employment occurred immediately prior to the Effective Time.
In particular, with respect to any Continuing Employee who immediately prior
to the Effective Time had the position of a Company Senior Vice President or
Vice President shall be provided with severance pay and benefits in
accordance with the Company Severance Guidelines set forth on Section
6.6(g)(ii)(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, at the typical benefit
level without adjustment, with such severance pay and benefits payable upon a
termination of the Continuing Employee\'s employment without "Cause" (as
defined and set forth on Section 6.6(g)(ii)(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) by the Surviving Corporation or by the Continuing Employee for
"Good Reason" (as defined and set forth on Section 6.6(g)(ii)(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule).

 

 

 

(h) Nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, (i) shall be
treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or
(ii) subject to the requirements of this Section 6.6, shall limit the right
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan following the Closing
Date.

 

 

Section 6.7  Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses.
As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" includes all out-of-pocket
expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, experts and consultants to a party and its Affiliates) incurred by a
party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization,
preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the preparation, filing, printing
and mailing of the Proxy Statement and the solicitation of the
Requisite Shareholder Vote.

that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section 6.9  Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance.

 

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by Law (including
to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or
replacements of the WBCA adopted after the date of this Agreement that
increase the extent to which a corporation may indemnify its officers and
directors), indemnify and hold harmless (and advance expenses, provided the
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides a reasonable and customary
undertaking (which shall not include posting of any collateral) to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification) the present and former directors and officers of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, any Person acting as director, trustee or officer of
the Safeco Insurance Foundation on behalf of the Company or any fiduciaries
under any Company Benefit Plan (each an "Indemnified Party") against any and
all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
suit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
regulatory or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection
with any circumstances, developments or matters in existence, or acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the Effective Time,
including the approval of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time.

 

 

 

(b) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, at no expense to the beneficiaries,
either (i) continue to maintain in effect for six (6) years from the
Effective Time directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance having terms and conditions at least as
favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the Company\'s currently
existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance (the "Current Insurance") with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
the transactions contemplated hereby), or (ii) purchase a six (6)
year extended reporting period endorsement with respect to the Current
Insurance (a "Reporting Tail Endorsement") and maintain this endorsement in
full force and effect for its full term. To the extent purchased after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, such insurance policies
shall be placed through such broker(s) and with such insurance carriers as
may be specified by Parent and as are reasonably acceptable to the Company;
provided that such insurance carrier has at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best
with respect to directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for any such
policies contemplated by this Section 6.9(b) an annual premium (measured for
"tail" purposes by reference to 1/6th the premium paid therefor) amount
in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for
such insurance; provided further that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this
Section 6.9(b), but subject to the second and third sentences of this Section
6.9(b), the Company shall be permitted at its sole and exclusive option
to purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement prior to the Effective Time.

shall include provisions for indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of the Indemnified Parties on the same basis as set forth in the
Constituent Documents of the Company in effect on the date of
this Agreement. Following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect the provisions in its articles of incorporation and
bylaws providing for indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
of Indemnified Parties, as applicable, with respect to the facts or
circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted from time to time under applicable Law, which provisions
shall not be amended except as required by applicable Law or except to make
changes permitted by applicable Law that would enlarge the scope of the

successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

 

Section 8.1  Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and
the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Requisite
Shareholder Vote (with any termination by Parent also being an effective
termination by Merger Sub):

 

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if:

 

 

(i) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before November 15, 2008
(the "Initial Outside Date"); provided, however, that if on the Initial
Outside Date any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.1(b),
Section 7.1(c) and Section 7.2(d) shall not have been satisfied but all
other conditions to Closing set forth in Article VII shall be satisfied or
capable of being satisfied, then the Initial Outside Date shall be
extended to December 31, 2008 if Parent or the Company notifies the other in
writing on or prior to November 15, 2008 of its election to extend
the Initial Outside Date (as so extended, the "Outside Date"); provided,
however that the right to extend the Initial Outside Date or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to (A)
the Company if its breach of any of its obligations under Section 6.2 or
Section 6.3 has been a principal cause of the failure of the Merger to
be consummated by the Initial Outside Date or (B) any party whose failure to
act in good faith or to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with Section 6.5 has been a
principal cause of the failure of the Merger to be consummated by the Initial
Outside Date;

 

 

(ii) any Governmental Entity in the United States of competent jurisdiction
issues an Order or takes any other action permanently restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such Order or other action shall have
become final and non-appealable; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be
available

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to any party whose failure to act in good faith or to use its reasonable
best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance
with Section 6.5 has been a principal cause of the application or imposition
of such Order or action; or

 

 

 

(iii) the Requisite Shareholder Vote shall not have been obtained upon a vote
taken thereon at the Company Shareholders Meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

 

 

(c) by Parent:

 

 

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) is incapable of being cured
by the Company by the Outside Date or (B) if capable of being cured, has not
been cured by the Company within forty-five (45) days following written notice
to the Company from Parent or Merger Sub of such breach, which notice states
Parent\'s intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(c)(i), and, in each case, would result in a failure of any condition set
forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b); provided that Parent shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(i)
if it is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement hereunder; or

 

 

(ii) prior to the shareholders of the Company having voted upon approval of
this Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting, if (A) the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have effected a
Recommendation Withdrawal or (B) the Company shall have materially breached
its obligations or agreements contained in Section 6.2, Section 6.3(a),
Section 6.3(b), Section 6.3(c), Section 6.3(d), or Section 6.3(e) (excluding
in each case inadvertent breaches which are capable of being cured and that
are cured within three (3) Business Days following the receipt of written
notice of such breach from Parent); provided, however, that Parent\'s right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(ii) in respect of
a Recommendation Withdrawal (other than a Recommendation Withdrawal in
connection with a Takeover Proposal as contemplated by Section 6.3(c)(iii))
shall terminate ten (10) Business Days following such Recommendation
Withdrawal.

 

 

(d) by the Company:

 

 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) is incapable of being
cured by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, by the Outside Date or (B)
if capable of being cured, has not been cured by Parent or Merger Sub, as the
case may be, within forty-five (45) days following written notice to Parent
or Merger Sub, as the case may be, from the Company of such breach, which
notice states the Company\'s intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.1(d)(i),

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and, in each case, would result in a failure of any condition set forth in
Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b); provided that the Company shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(i) if
it is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement hereunder; or

 

 

 

(ii) prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote, in accordance with,
and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 6.3(d)(ii).

8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX, each of which shall survive the termination

that neither Parent nor the Company shall be released from any liabilities or
damages (including, in the case of claims by the Company, as contemplated by
Section 9.5(b)(ii)) arising out of any willful or intentional breach of any
representation or warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement or, in
the case of Parent, any breach of Section 4.10, or fraud, prior to
such termination.

 

 

Section 8.3  Termination Fee.

 

 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(i) and (i) a Takeover Proposal was publicly proposed or
announced by any Person after the date of this Agreement and not irrevocably
withdrawn prior to such termination (provided that for purposes of this
Agreement a Takeover Proposal shall not be deemed to have been irrevocably

agreement with respect to, or shall have consummated, a Takeover Proposal
made by or on behalf of such Person), and (ii) the Company enters into

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) and (i) a Takeover Proposal was
publicly proposed or announced by any Person after the date of this Agreement
and not irrevocably withdrawn as of the time of the Company Shareholders
Meeting (provided that for purposes of this Agreement a Takeover Proposal
shall not be deemed to have been irrevocably withdrawn by such Person if
within twelve (12) months of such Company Shareholders Meeting the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or shall have consummated, a Takeover Proposal made by or on
behalf of such Person), and (ii) the Company enters into a definitive

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

termination of this Agreement, then, on the date of such entering into a
definitive agreement or consummation, the Company shall pay or cause to be
paid to Parent (or its designees) the Termination Fee by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by Parent. For purposes of this Section 8.3(b), each reference to "20% or
more" in the definition of "Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be a
reference to "more than 50%".

 

 

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(ii), then, immediately prior to and as a condition to such
termination, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent (or its
designees) the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.

 

 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(i) and (i) a Takeover Proposal was publicly proposed or
announced by any Person after the date of this Agreement and not irrevocably
withdrawn prior to the Company breach or failure to perform giving rise to
such termination (provided that for purposes of this Agreement a Takeover
Proposal shall not be deemed to have been irrevocably withdrawn by such
Person if within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into a definitive agreement
with respect to, or shall have consummated, a Takeover Proposal made by or
on behalf of such Person), and (ii) the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or there is consummated, a transaction
in connection with a Takeover Proposal with any Person within twelve (12)
months after such termination of this Agreement, then, on the date of such
entering into a definitive agreement or consummation, the Company shall pay
or cause to be paid to Parent (or its designees) the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by Parent. For purposes of this Section 8.3(d), each reference to "20% or
more" in the definition of "Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be a
reference to "more than 50%".

 

 

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(ii)(A), then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later
than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause
to be paid to Parent (or its designees) the Termination Fee by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by Parent.

 

 

(f) The parties agree and understand that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if Parent
receives the Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to this Section 8.3,
such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub
against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, shareholders, managers,
members or Affiliates and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
shareholders, managers, members or Affiliates shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided that the foregoing shall not limit
the obligations of the Company set forth in the last sentence of this
Section 8.3; and (ii) if Parent or Merger Sub receives any payments from the
Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement, and thereafter Parent is
entitled to receive the Termination Fee under this Section 8.3, the amount
of such Termination Fee shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of
any payments made by the Company to Parent or Merger Sub in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect of any such breaches of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that
the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements,
the parties would not enter into this Agreement, and that any amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 8.3 do not constitute a penalty. If the
Company fails to pay as directed in writing by Parent the Termination Fee due
to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 8.3 within the time periods
specified in this Section 8.3, the Company shall pay the out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses of outside
counsel) incurred by Parent in connection with any action, including the
filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts,
together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate
prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal,
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid until the date of actual payment.

 

 

 

Section 8.4  Procedure for Termination. A termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1 shall, in order to be effective, require in the case
of each of Parent and Merger Sub, action by its board of directors or, to the
extent permitted by Law, the duly authorized designee of its board of
directors, and in the case of the Company, to the extent permitted by Law,
action by the Board of Directors of the Company. Termination of this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the
shareholders of the Company. A terminating party shall provide written notice
of termination to the other parties specifying with reasonable particularity
the basis for this termination. If more than one provision in Section 8.1 is
available to a terminating party in connection with a termination,
a terminating party may rely on any or all available provisions in Section
8.1 for any termination.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section, clause or
Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section or clause of or Schedule to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The
phrases "the date of this Agreement", "the date hereof" and terms of similar
import, will be deemed to refer to April 23, 2008. Whenever the content of
this Agreement permits, the masculine gender will include the feminine
and neuter genders, and a reference to singular or plural will
be interchangeable with the other. Whenever the words "include", "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation".

 

 

(b) References to any agreement or contract are to that agreement or contract
as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof. References to any Person include the successors
and permitted assigns of that Person. References to any statute are to that
statute, as amended from time to time, and to the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. References to "$" and "dollars" are to the currency of
the United States of America. References from or through any date mean,
unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and
including, respectively. The words "hereby," "herein," "hereof," "hereunder"
and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole (including any
Schedules delivered herewith) and not merely to the specific section,
paragraph or clause in which such word appears.

 

 

(c) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

 

 

(d) No summary of this Agreement or Schedule delivered herewith prepared by
or on behalf of any party will affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any such Schedule.

 

 

Section 9.4 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in
two (2) or more counterparts, including by facsimile, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original but all of which shall constitute one and the
same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party
has received counterparts thereof signed and delivered (by electronic
communication, facsimile or otherwise) by all of the other parties.

 

 

Section 9.5  Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

 

 

(a) This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure
Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement,
and supersede all

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

 

 

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party and, except for (i) the provisions of Section 6.9 (which, from
and after the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties), and (ii) the right of the Company to recover, solely through an
action brought by the Company, damages from Parent in the event of a willful
or intentional breach of this Agreement by Parent, any breach of Section
4.10, or fraud, in which event the damages recoverable by the Company for
itself and on behalf of the holders of Common Stock, Options and Restricted
Stock Rights shall be determined by reference to the total amount that would
have been recoverable by such holders if all such holders brought an action
against Parent and were recognized as third party beneficiaries hereunder,
this Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other
than the parties any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

 

(c) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties and are for the sole benefit of the parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to
waiver by the parties in accordance with Section 9.9(b) without notice
or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any
of the parties. Consequently, Persons other than the parties may not rely
upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 

 

Section 9.6  Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

 

Section 9.7  Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties,
in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the
prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any
such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. This Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

 

Section 9.8  Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any
time before or after the Requisite Shareholder Vote is obtained, but after
such approval no amendment shall be made which by Law or in accordance with
the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

approval by the shareholders of the Company without such further approval.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties.

 

 

 

Section 9.9  Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of
directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b)
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this
Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or
further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement.
