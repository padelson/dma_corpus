assets  and rights covered by the Joint Use ROW Agreements, and (2)  Buyer

Permitted Encumbrances.   (ii) "Permitted Encumbrances" shall mean:   (A)
Preferential purchase rights and Required  Consents with respect to which (i)

an exercise of such rights;   (B) Liens for Taxes or assessments not due
or  not delinquent on the Closing Date, or that  are being contested in good
faith with any  action to foreclose on or attach any  Interests on account
thereof properly  stayed; provided that, Seller shall be  responsible for
and promptly pay when due,  all amounts finally determined to be owed  that
are the subject of such contest and are  attributable to the period prior to
the  Effective Time and any interest accruing on  such amounts before or
after the Effective  Time;   (C) All rights to consent by, required
notices  to, filings with, or other actions by  Governmental Entities in
connection with the  sale or conveyance of the Interests, if the  same are
customarily obtained subsequent to  the sale or conveyance of assets of
such  nature;   (D) Easements, rights-of-way, servitudes,  permits,
surface leases, and other rights in  respect of surface operations on or over
any  Interest which individually or in the  aggregate do not materially
interfere    4     with or adversely affect current or  reasonably
anticipated future operation, use  or ownership of such Interest or the 
Business or materially impair the value of  such Interest or the
Business;   (E) All federal, state or local laws, rules of  law or laws or
regulations that govern or  apply to the operation of such property;   (F)
Materialmen\'s, mechanic\'s, repairmen\'s,  employee\'s, contractor\'s, and
other similar  Liens or charges arising in the ordinary  course of business
for obligations that are  not delinquent and that will be paid and 
discharged in the ordinary course of  business or, if delinquent, that are
being  contested in good faith with any action to  foreclose on or attach
any Interests on  account thereof properly stayed; provided,  that, Seller
shall be responsible for and  promptly pay when due all amounts finally 
determined to be owed that are the subject  of such contest and are
attributable to the  period prior to the Effective Time and any  interest
accruing on such amounts before or  after the Effective Time;   (G) Rights
reserved for or vested in any  Governmental Entity to control or restrict 
any of the real property interest  constituting a part of the Interests;  
(H) Liens created by Buyer or its successors or  assigns;   (I)
Imperfections or defects of title (including  failures to have contiguous
easements or  properties) which individually or in the  aggregate do not
materially interfere with  or adversely affect current or anticipated 
future operation, use or ownership of such  Interest or the Business or
materially  impair the value of such Interest or the  Business;   (J) Any
Title Defects waived by Buyer pursuant  to the terms of this Agreement;  
(K) Defects of title (including failure to have  contiguous easements or
properties) which  are of an immaterial nature and, in light of  the
circumstances, are of a nature that  would be reasonably acceptable to a
prudent  pipeline operator; and   (L) Any other Liens listed on Schedule 
4(a)(ii)(L) of the Seller Disclosure  Schedule.    5     (b) The
Interests shall be deemed to have a "Title  Defect" if Seller has less than
Defensible Title to  the Interests.   (c) Purchase Price adjustments or
claims for Title  Defects shall be made in accordance with the  following
procedures:   (i) All Title Defect notices by Buyer must be  delivered to
Seller, in writing, on or  before 150 days following the Closing. Buyer 
may, by timely delivery of one or more  written notices to Seller of the
existence  of alleged Title Defects, request reduction  of the Base Purchase
Price by, or seek  indemnification for, an amount equal to the  lesser of
the cost to cure such Title Defect  (if the same can be cured) or the
reduction  in value of the Val Verde System resulting  from the existence of
such Title Defect. To  the extent reasonably necessary for Seller  to become
apprised of and evaluate the  asserted Title Defect, each Title Defect 
notice shall clearly indicate the nature of  the Title Defect, the Interest
to which it  relates, an explanation of the Title Defect  including the
supporting legal theories, and  the amount by which Buyer, in good faith, 
believes the Base Purchase Price should be  reduced or a payment made to
Buyer because  of the Title Defect, with the computation  and information
upon which Buyer\'s belief is  based. In determining whether a portion of 
an Interest contains a Title Defect, it is  the intent of the Parties to
include, when  possible, only that portion of such Interest  materially and
adversely affected.   (ii) Seller shall have the right, but not the 
obligation, to attempt to cure any alleged  Title Defect. In this connection
Seller may,  in its discretion, extend the Closing Date  for up to 45 days
to effect such cure with  respect to Title Defect claims made prior to 
Closing. In the event Seller is unable or  unwilling to cure an alleged Title
Defect,  Buyer and Seller shall meet and endeavor to  agree on the validity
of the Title Defect  claim and the amount of any required  purchase price
adjustment. In evaluating the  significance of a fact, circumstance or 
condition for purposes of determining an  alleged Title Defect, due
consideration  shall be given to the length of time that  the particular
Interest has been in  existence with the defect in place and  whether such
fact, circumstance or condition  would be reasonably acceptable to prudent 
persons engaged in the business of the  ownership, development, and operation
of  gathering pipelines and treating plants with  knowledge of all of the
facts and  appreciation of their legal significance.   (iii) In the event
the Parties cannot mutually  agree on a purchase price adjustment for  Title
Defects which are timely and properly  noticed by Buyer pursuant to this
Section 4,  then either Buyer or Seller may, subject to  subsections (iv)
and (v) below, submit the  disputed Title Defect to dispute resolution 
pursuant to the procedures in Schedule  4(c)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule.    6     (iv) There shall be no purchase price adjustment 
or indemnification claim made by Buyer under  this Agreement for any
individual Title  Defect unless such individual Title Defect  involves an
amount payable by or liability  of Seller which is in excess of $25,000 
("Qualified Title Defect Claims") and there  shall be no purchase price
adjustment or  indemnification made for Title Defects until  all Qualified
Title Defect Claims exceed  $500,000 in the aggregate. A series of  related
Title Defects arising out of  substantially the same facts and 
circumstances may be considered an  individual Title Defect for purposes of 
meeting the foregoing $25,000 threshold  amount.   (v) After the $500,000
threshold in subsection  (iv) has been reached, there shall be no  purchase
price adjustment or indemnification  claim made for Qualified Title Defect
Claims  unless all Qualified Title Defect Claims  exceed $350,000 in the
aggregate and then  only to the extent in excess of such  $350,000
deductible.  5. Conditions of Closing by Seller. The obligation of Seller to
close is  subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:   (a)

Schedule 7(e) to  the Seller Disclosure Schedule from third parties shall
have  been obtained except for consents, approvals, or waiver which 
constitute Permitted Encumbrances or where the failure to  obtain such
consent would not otherwise have a material  adverse effect on the Interests
or Business.  7. Representations and Warranties of Seller. Seller represents

licenses,  permits and authorizations are validly held by  Seller, except
for such failures that, individually  or in the aggregate, could not

To  the knowledge of Seller, the licenses, permits and  authorizations

COSTS, EXPENSES AND DAMAGES IN QUESTION AROSE SOLELY OR IN  PART FROM THE
ACTIVE, PASSIVE, COMPARATIVE, OR CONCURRENT  NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT OF SELLER PARTIES,  BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO
FUTURE ACTS OR  OMISSIONS OF SELLER PARTIES.    21    12. Due
Diligence Review.   (a) Prior to Closing, Seller, in Seller\'s offices, will
make  available to Buyer and Buyer\'s authorized representatives for 
examination as Buyer may reasonably request, all physical land  files,
regulatory files, abstracts, title opinions,  engineering data, reports,
maps, drawings, surveys, books,  accounting records, and agreements contained
in Seller\'s files  relating to the Interests (collectively the "Records"); 
provided, however, the Records shall not include (i) any  proprietary data
which relates to another business of Seller  and is not needed in connection
with the continued operation  of the Business, (ii) any information subject
to third party  confidentiality agreements for which a consent or waiver 
cannot be secured by Seller after reasonable efforts, or (iii)  any
information which, if disclosed, would violate an  attorney-client
privilege.   (b) Subject to subsection (a) above, Seller shall permit Buyer
and  Buyer\'s authorized representatives to consult with Seller\'s 
employees during reasonable business hours (including 7:00  a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
(New Mexico time) Monday through Friday) and  to conduct, at Buyer\'s sole
risk and expense, inspections and  inventories of the Interests and to
examine all Records at the  Plant Facility. Seller shall also coordinate, in
advance, with  Buyer to allow site visits and inspections at the field
sites  on Saturdays unless operational conditions would reasonably  prohibit
such access. During such inspections, Buyer shall  have the right to review
the Interests to determine the  environmental and other condition of the
Interests. To the  extent Buyer desires access to Seller\'s Interests located
on  other\'s property or to any Records located at such location,  Seller
shall assist Buyer in obtaining such access; provided,  however, Buyer shall
not contact the owner of the property  directly.   (c) Buyer agrees to
protect, defend, indemnify and hold Seller  Parties harmless from and against
any and all Claims occurring  on or to the Interests caused by the acts or
omissions of  Buyer, Buyer\'s Affiliates or any Person acting on Buyer\'s
or  its Affiliate\'s behalf in connection with any due diligence  conducted
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement,  including any site visits
and environmental sampling. Buyer  agrees to comply fully with all rules,
regulations and  instructions issued by Seller (to the extent reasonable
notice  thereof has been given to Buyer) regarding Buyer\'s actions  while
upon, entering or leaving any property included in the  Interests, including
any insurance requirements that Seller  may impose on contractors authorized
to perform work on any  property owned or operated by Seller.   (d) Buyer
shall not be entitled to perform any environmental  diligence beyond a Phase
I environmental analysis nor any  subsurface investigation or invasive or
destructive sampling  without the prior written consent of Seller, which
consent  will not be unreasonably withheld. Prior to the date hereof,  Buyer
and Seller have agreed upon and approved the site  assessment plan attached
hereto as "Exhibit O." Buyer and  Seller agree to cooperate with respect to
the prompt    22     implementation and completion of the activities
described in  Exhibit O. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that additional  Pre-
Closing investigation and site assessment may be conducted  if reasonably
required by the selected insurance carrier to  secure the Environmental
Insurance described in Section 14 or  if Buyer is not reasonably certain that
it will be able to  obtain the Environmental Insurance. In each such case,
the  scope of any subsequent environmental investigation and site 
assessment shall be subject to the prior written approval of  Seller, which
will not be unreasonably withheld. Seller agrees  to cooperate, in good
faith, with Buyer and with any  representatives of the selected insurer to
determine the scope  of additional environmental investigation (including
sampling)  which may be required in connection with the application for 
Environmental Insurance or Buyer\'s due diligence efforts if  the
Environmental Insurance is not obtainable. Buyer shall  furnish Seller copies
of all environmental and other reports  obtained by, or prepared by or for
Buyer or its Affiliates and  their respective agents in connection with any
of the  foregoing inspections. All such environmental reports shall be 
deemed to be "Evaluation Material" under the Confidentiality  Agreement and
will be held in confidence in accordance with  the terms thereof and, if the
transactions contemplated herein  are not consummated, will be delivered to
Seller in accordance  with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.  13.
Pre-Closing Environmental Defects.   (a) As used in this Agreement, the
following terms shall have the  meanings prescribed below:   (i)
"Environmental Defect" shall mean a claim or  condition attributable to or
arising out of (1) a  violation of any Environmental Law applicable to the 
Interests occurring prior to the Closing Date or (2)  any Existing
Environmental Condition.   (ii) "Environmental Law" shall mean any and all
laws,  statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, or orders  of any
Governmental Entity pertaining to the  protection of the environment or
natural resources or  to Hazardous Materials in any and all jurisdictions 
in which the party in question owns property or  conducts business, including
the Clean Air Act, the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, 
and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"), the Federal  Water Pollution Control
Act, the Occupational Safety  and Health Act of 1970, the Resource
Conservation and  Recovery Act of 1976 ("RCRA"), the Safe Drinking  Water
Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the  Hazardous and Solid Waste
Amendments Act of 1984, the  Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of
1986,  the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, the Oil  Pollution Act of
1990, any state or local laws  implementing or substantially equivalent to
the  foregoing federal laws, and any state or local laws  pertaining to the
handling of oil and gas  exploration, production, gathering, and processing 
wastes or the use, maintenance, and closure of pits  and impoundments,   
23     and all other environmental conservation or  protection laws all
as amended from time to time from  enactment or adoption through the date of
this  Agreement.   (iii) "Existing Environmental Condition" shall mean (1)
any  environmental pollution, contamination, degradation,  damage or injury
caused by, related to, arising from,  or in connection with the generation,
handling, use,  treatment, storage, transportation, disposal,  discharge,
release or emission of any Hazardous  Materials occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date  and for which prompt remedial action is presently  required
(or if known, would be presently required)  under Environmental Laws in
effect on the Closing  Date or (2) any third party claim which is brought 
against Seller and based on the release or migration  of Hazardous Materials
prior to the Closing Date from  any of the Interests to such third party\'s
property  as a result of or in connection with Seller\'s conduct  of the
Business.   (iv) "Hazardous Materials" shall mean: (1) any chemicals, 
materials or substances defined or included in the  definition of "hazardous
substances," "hazardous  materials," "toxic substances," "solid wastes," 
"pollutants," "contaminants," or words of similar  import, under any
Environmental Law; (2) radioactive  materials (other than naturally occurring
radioactive  materials), friable asbestos, and polychlorinated  biphenyls;
(c) any other chemical, material or  substance, exposure to which is
prohibited, limited  or regulated by any Governmental Entity; or (d) 
regulated constituents or substances in  concentrations or levels that exceed
numeric or  risk-based standards established pursuant to  Environmental
Laws.   (b) Any Environmental Defect notice by Buyer under this Section 13 
must be delivered to Seller on or before June 20, 2002. Buyer  may, by timely
delivery of written notice under this Section  13 to Seller of the existence
of an alleged Environmental  Defect, request reduction of the purchase price.
The  Environmental Defect notice shall clearly indicate the nature  of and
include a detailed description of the Environmental  Defect, the Interest to
which it relates, and the net present  value of the cost of curing or
remediating the Environmental  Defect using the Cost Effective Remedy. The
Environmental  Defect notice shall include a complete copy of all written 
information furnished to or in the possession of Buyer or its  Affiliates
relating to the alleged Environmental Defect  (excluding such information as
was contained in Seller\'s data  room or otherwise in the possession of
Seller or its  Affiliates) and all environmental reports, data, valuations, 
damage assessments and conclusions associated with the  Environmental Defect.
The Environmental Defect notice shall  also provide documentation and
calculations reasonably  substantiating the existence of the Environmental
Defect and  supporting the estimate of the net present value of the Cost 
Effective Remedy. In the event any such notice is not timely  delivered, all
Environmental Defects known to Buyer as of such  date shall be deemed waived
and Buyer shall thereafter have no  right to or seek a purchase price
adjustment or,    24     otherwise seek indemnification for such
Environmental Defects.  Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to  attempt to cure any alleged Environmental Defect prior to  Closing at
Seller\'s sole cost and expense. In this connection,  Seller may, in its
discretion, extend the Closing Date for up  to 45 days to effect such cure.
In the event Seller is unable  or unwilling to cure an alleged Environmental
Defect, Buyer  and Seller shall meet and endeavor to agree on the validity
of  the claimed Environmental Defect and the amount of any  required
purchase price adjustment. In considering the  significance of a fact,
circumstance or condition for purposes  of determining an alleged
Environmental Defect, due  consideration shall be given to whether such
fact,  circumstance or condition would be acceptable to reasonable  and
prudent persons engaged in the business of ownership,  development and
operation of gathering pipelines and treating  plants. To the extent that
Buyer receives a Purchase Price  reduction for a Pre-Closing Environmental
Defect, then such  Purchase Price reduction shall result in a waiver with
respect  to such Pre-Closing Environmental Defect notwithstanding that  the
actual remediation costs subsequently incurred by Buyer  exceeded the
Purchase Price reduction.   (c) Seller may elect, at its option, (i) to cure
the Environmental  Defect at its cost prior to Closing, but only if the 
Environmental Defect following such curative actions meets the  requirements
of applicable Environmental Laws or (ii) reduce  the Base Purchase Price by
the agreed upon value of the  Environmental Defect, in which event Buyer will
assume all  curative, investigative, remedial or corrective action 
requirements ("Environmental Corrective Costs") with respect  to such
Environmental Defects. In the event the Parties cannot  mutually agree on a
purchase price adjustment for  Environmental Defects alleged by Buyer
pursuant to this  Section 13, then Buyer and Seller shall, subject to
subsection  (d) below, proceed with Closing and the disputed Environmental 
Defect shall be submitted to dispute resolution pursuant to  the procedure in
Schedule 13(c) of the Seller Disclosure  Schedule.   (d) To the extent
necessary to be able to comply with its  indemnification obligations
hereunder, (A) Seller shall have  the right, from time to time, to review all
environmental  reports and records related to the Interests to the extent 
related to any Pre-Closing environmental issues, and to have  access to the
Real Property from time to time and (B) Seller  shall have the right to
participate in and comment on (1) any  remedial action, including determining
the scope, extent,  duration and cost of such remedial action, and (2) all 
discussions, negotiations and proceedings with Governmental  Entities and
third parties in connection therewith.   (e) Buyer shall not be entitled to
assert any Environmental Defect  under this Section 13 unless the claim is
timely made in  accordance with the provisions of this Section 13 and the
net  present value of the Cost Effective Remedy exceeds $35,000 (a 
"Qualified Environmental Claim") and then only when the sum of  all such
Qualified Environmental Claims exceeds $500,000 in  the aggregate (the
"Environmental Threshold").    25     (f) After the Environmental
Threshold has been reached, Buyer  shall be entitled to a purchase price
adjustment for Qualified  Environmental Claims only to the extent of the
amount in  excess of $350,000 (the "Environmental Deductible").   (g) After
the Environmental Threshold has been reached, Buyer  shall be entitled to a
purchase price adjustment for Qualified  Environmental Claims exceeding the
Environmental Deductible  referenced in subsection (f) above up to an
aggregate of  $1,150,000. Buyer shall not be entitled to any purchase price 
adjustment for the next $1,000,000 in Qualified Environmental  Claims, but
shall be entitled to claim an additional reduction  in the purchase price to
the extent that Qualified  Environmental Claims in excess of the
Environmental Deductible  exceed $2,150,000 in the aggregate.   (h) Buyer
agrees that it will have responsibility for and will  indemnify and hold
harmless Seller Parties from and against  Pre-Closing Environmental Defects
that form the basis for any  purchase price adjustment claimed by Buyer,
including any  Qualified Environmental Claims that are counted toward the 
Environmental Deductible.   (i) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, in the  event that the Pre-Closing Environmental Defects and
Title  Defects asserted by Buyer prior to the Closing exceed  $10,000,000 in
the aggregate, then Seller may at its option,  terminate this Agreement by
providing written notice of  termination to Buyer.  14. Environmental
Insurance.   (a) Buyer and Seller intend to obtain environmental insurance
to  address environmental matters arising out of the Interests or  the
Business, other than those environmental matters for which  indemnification
is specifically provided by Seller to Buyer in  the Agreement, and the
Transaction Agreements. Buyer agrees  that it will use reasonable commercial
efforts to initially  obtain and will coordinate with Seller in an effort to
obtain  a quotation for a policy having $35 million of coverage, a $1 
million aggregate deductible and a 10 year term (the "Baseline  Policy"). The
parties shall cooperate in a collective effort  to obtain policy terms which
would result in Seller\'s  indemnity referenced in Schedule 14(e) hereto not
being  required. Furthermore, Buyer agrees that it will use  reasonable
commercial efforts to eliminate exclusions from the  policy, where possible,
and to coordinate with Seller in such  efforts to eliminate policy
exclusions. Buyer and Seller agree  that once the quote for the Baseline
Policy has been obtained,  the Parties will, collectively, attempt on a
commercially  reasonable basis to acquire endorsements to eliminate policy 
exclusions for Third Party Claims, Civil Fines and Penalties  and Scheduled
Offsite Disposal Sites up to the limitations  imposed by the $1,500,000
premium limit. This effort to  eliminate policy exclusions will be made prior
to Buyer  attempting to reduce the policy deductible or increase policy 
limits as provided in subsection (d) below.    26     (b) In this
connection Buyer agrees to use reasonable best efforts  to obtain, within two
weeks from the date hereof, a commitment  from an insurer to provide
environmental insurance (the  "Environmental Insurance") at the Closing under
the following  parameters: (1) the insurance is under written by an insurer 
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller provided that AIG,  Chubb, XL and
Kemper and other similarly positioned insurance  companies shall be deemed to
be acceptable insurers; (2) the  insurance policy shall provide for $35
million of coverage, a  minimum 10 year term (unless Buyer agrees to a lesser
term),  and a maximum aggregate deductible of $1,000,000 (unless Buyer 
agrees to a higher maximum aggregate deductible); (3) Seller  and its
Affiliates will be named as an additional insured and  Duke Energy Field
Services, LP will be an additional named  insured and (4) the policy will be
in a form and scope  reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller (e.g.,
coverage for  historical matters other than Criminal Fines and Penalties
and  Punitive Damages) and have exclusions which are customary and  of a
nature which should be reasonably acceptable to a prudent  pipeline operator
similarly situated. Buyer further agrees to  promptly provide Seller with
copies of all correspondence  between potential carriers and Buyer with
respect to the  efforts to obtain such insurance including copies of all 
requests for information and proposals and requests to conduct  environmental
assessments. Seller shall, furthermore, be  entitled to participate in all
conferences, meetings and site  visits with representatives of the potential
insurers.   (c) The premium for the Environmental Insurance shall be borne 
one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer provided that neither  Buyer nor
Seller will be required to contribute in excess of  $750,000 toward payment
of such premium.   (d) Buyer has the right to reduce the aggregate maximum
policy  deductible below $1.0 million or increase the policy limits  above
$35 million provided that Buyer shall pay any policy  premiums in excess of
$1.0 million to the extent that such  excess is attributable to such
items.   (e) In the event that a commitment for Environmental Insurance is 
not obtained by Buyer on or prior to June 5, 2002 (or such  later date as may
be agreed by Seller), then Seller, at its  option, may: (i) pay any
additional premium required to obtain  the Environmental Insurance, (ii)
terminate this Agreement or  (iii) provide the environmental indemnity
contained in  Schedule 14(e) hereto which indemnity shall survive the 
Closing in accordance with the provisions set forth in  Schedule 14(e);
provided that in the event Environmental  Insurance is obtained then Schedule
14(e) shall not become  effective, except as otherwise provided in such
Schedule.   (f) In the event that Seller elects to proceed with the
Closing  and to provide the environmental indemnity in subsection 
14(e)(iii) above, then Buyer and Seller agree for a period of  90 days
following the Closing to cooperate with each other and  to continue to use
reasonable best efforts to complete any  environmental inspections required
by the potential insurers  and to obtain the Environmental Insurance. In the
event that  Buyer fails to obtain the Environmental Insurance, Seller, 
within nine months, following Closing may obtain the  Environmental   
27     Insurance and at such time as the policy is effective the 
environmental indemnity provided by Seller pursuant to  subsection 14(e)(iii)
above shall terminate except with  respect to claims made under such
indemnity prior to the  effective date of the Policy.   (g) If Buyer, in
its sole discretion, elects to exclude from  coverage under the Baseline
Policy the gathering lines that  comprise a portion of the Gathering System
(other than the  Stations, the Plant Facility and other above ground
facilities  adjacent thereto and that portion of the gathering pipeline 
thereunder), such gathering lines, excluding such other  facilities, being
referred to as the "Pipeline," Seller will  have no indemnification
obligations under Schedule 14(e)  arising out of or attributable to the
Pipeline.  15. Confidentiality. All Records and all other confidential data
provided  to Buyer, whether before or after the date of this Agreement, and
all  non-public title matters and environmental reports prepared by Buyer
or  Buyer\'s representatives relating to the Interests, shall be treated by 
Buyer as strictly confidential, and shall not be disclosed to any  Person,
without the prior written consent of Seller unless required by  law or
regulation. All notices of Environmental Defects, environmental  assessments
and other environmental information prepared by Buyer or  Buyer\'s
representatives relating to the Interests shall be treated by  Seller as
strictly confidential, and shall not be disclosed to any  Person, without the
prior written consent of Buyer unless required by  law or regulation. In the
event this purchase and sale does not close,  this covenant shall survive
termination of this Agreement for a period  of two years; and in the event
this purchase and sale closes, Buyer\'s  covenant shall terminate at Closing,
but Seller\'s covenants relating to  Environmental Defects, environmental
assessments and other  environmental information shall continue for two
years. In the event  this purchase and sale closes, all Records and all other
confidential  data relating to the Interests or the Business, and all non-
public  title matters relating to the Interests, shall be treated by Seller
as  strictly confidential, and shall not be disclosed to any Person for a 
period of two years after Closing, without the prior written consent of 
Seller unless required by law or regulation.  16. DISCLAIMERS. EXCEPT AS
OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT,  THE INTERESTS ARE BEING
CONVEYED AND ASSIGNED TO AND ACCEPTED BY BUYER  IN THEIR "AS IS, WHERE IS"
CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR, AND WITH ALL  FAULTS AND DEFECTS, WITHOUT ANY
REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR COVENANT OF  ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS, IMPLIED

QUALITY, CONDITION, CONFORMITY  TO SAMPLES, MERCHANTABILITY, AND/OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,  ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY SELLER
AND WAIVED BY BUYER.  THE INTERESTS HAVE BEEN USED FOR GAS PIPELINE,
TRANSPORTATION,  TREATING, STORAGE AND RELATED OPERATIONS. PHYSICAL CHANGES
IN THE  INTERESTS AND IN THE LANDS BURDENED THEREBY MAY HAVE OCCURRED AS A 
RESULT OF SUCH USES. THE INTERESTS MAY ALSO INCLUDE BURIED PIPELINES 
AND    28     OTHER EQUIPMENT, THE LOCATIONS OF WHICH MAY NOT BE KNOWN
BY SELLER OR  READILY APPARENT BY A PHYSICAL INSPECTION OF THE INTERESTS. IT
IS  UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT BUYER SHALL HAVE INSPECTED PRIOR TO CLOSING 
(OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED ITS RIGHT TO INSPECT) THE INTERESTS  AND
THE ASSOCIATED PREMISES, AND SATISFIED ITSELF AS TO THEIR PHYSICAL  AND
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION, AND THAT BUYER SHALL ACCEPT ALL OF THE  SAME IN
THEIR "AS IS, WHERE IS" CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR, AND WITH  ALL FAULTS
AND DEFECTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE PRESENCE OF  MAN-MADE
MATERIAL FIBERS (MMMF) AND THE PRESENCE, RELEASE OR DISPOSAL  OF HAZARDOUS
SUBSTANCES. IN ADDITION, SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION,  COVENANT OR
WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, AS TO THE ACCURACY  OR COMPLETENESS
OF ANY DATA OR RECORDS DELIVERED TO BUYER WITH RESPECT  TO THE INTERESTS,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DESCRIPTION OF THE  INTERESTS, PRICING
ASSUMPTIONS OR QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF THE INTERESTS.  ANY RELIANCE ON OR USE
OF SUCH INFORMATION SHALL BE AT BUYER\'S SOLE  RISK. THIS SECTION SHALL NOT
OPERATE TO WAIVE OR RELEASE, AND IS  EXPRESSLY SUBJECT TO, ALL
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND  AGREEMENTS OF SELLER CONTAINED IN
THIS AGREEMENT. THIS SECTION SHALL  NOT OPERATE TO WAIVE OR RELEASE ANY
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES,  COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS OF SELLER CONTAINED IN
THE TRANSACTION  AGREEMENTS.  17. DTPA Waiver. TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE TO
THE INTERESTS OR ANY PORTION  THEREOF, BUYER HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS UNDER
THE PROVISIONS OF THE  TEXAS DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT, CHAPTER 17,
SUBCHAPTER E, SECTIONS  17.41 THROUGH 17.63, INCLUSIVE (OTHER THAN SECTION
17.555, WHICH IS NOT  WAIVED), OF THE TEXAS BUSINESS and COMMERCIAL CODE (A LAW
THAT GIVES  CONSUMERS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS). AFTER CONSULTATION
WITH AN  ATTORNEY OF ITS CHOICE, BUYER VOLUNTARILY CONSENTS TO THIS
WAIVER.  18. Covenants of Seller. Seller covenants and agrees that from and
after  the execution of this Agreement and until the Closing Date:   (a)
Seller will not sell, transfer, assign, convey or otherwise  dispose of any
Interests other than personal property and  equipment which is of a nature
which is disposed of, from time  to time, in the ordinary course of business
which is replaced  with property and equipment of comparable or better value
and  utility in the ordinary and routine maintenance and operation  of the
Interests;   (b) Seller will not create or knowingly permit the creation of
any  Lien on any Interest other than a Permitted Encumbrance  reflected in
Sections 4(a)(ii)(B), 4(a)(ii)(D) (other than  Liens granted to or created in
favor of Seller or any of its  Affiliates), 4(a)(ii)(E), 4(a)(ii)(F), or
4(a)(ii)(G) hereof;    29     (c) If Seller becomes aware of (i) any
major event or development  which reasonably may materially and adversely
affect any of  the Interests or the Business or impede the transaction 
contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) any suit, action or  other proceeding
before any court or governmental agency which  relates to the Interests or
which might result in impairment  or loss of Seller\'s title to any of the
Interests or the value  thereof, or which might hinder or impede the
operation of the  Interests, it will give prompt written notice to Buyer;
and   (d) Seller agrees to:   (i) cause the Interests to be maintained and
operated in  the ordinary course of business in accordance with  the past
operating and maintenance practices of  Seller, including regular scheduled
maintenance plans  and capital expenditures, and pay or cause to be paid 
all costs and expenses in connection therewith;   (ii) carry on its business
with respect to the Interests  in substantially the same manner as it has 
heretofore, not introducing any new method of  management, operation or
accounting with respect to  the Interests; and   (iii) use reasonable
efforts to preserve the business  involving the Interests intact, to keep
available the  services of the employees involved in the conduct of 
business involving the Interests and to preserve the  goodwill of customers
having business relations with  Seller relating to the Interests, in all
material  respects.   (e) Seller will not, without the consent of Buyer
which will not  be unreasonably withheld, attempt to renegotiate any
amounts  paid by or payable to Seller under any of the Material 
Contracts.   (f) As soon as possible after execution of this Agreement,
Seller  will promptly cooperate with Pricewaterhouse Coopers ("PWC")  to
enable PWC to provide to Buyer the following financial  information for the
Business: (1) a balance sheet as of  December 31, 2001 and income and cash
flow statements for the  twelve month period then ended, audited at Buyer\'s
expense by  PWC with an unqualified opinion from PWC on such audited 
statements (collectively, the "Audited Statements"); (2)  unaudited income
statements for each of the three month  periods ended March 31, June 30 and
September 30, 2001 and  March 31, 2002 (collectively, the "Unaudited
Statements").  Seller agrees to use reasonable efforts to facilitate the 
preparation of such financial statements prior to Closing  which fairly
present the results of operations of the Business  for the referenced
periods. In addition to the above audit  fees, Buyer would pay to Seller an
amount not to exceed  $50,000 for the reimbursement of incremental costs
(e.g.,  overtime and consulting fees) incurred by Seller in connection  with
the preparation of the Audited Statements and the  Unaudited Statements to
the extent all of such statements are  delivered to Buyer no later than June
14, 2002.    30    19. Casualty Loss.   (a) As used herein, the term
"Casualty Loss" shall mean, with  respect to all or any portion of the
Interests, any  destruction by fire, storm or other casualty, or any 
condemnation or taking or threatened condemnation or taking,  of all or any
portion of the Interests from and after the date  of the execution of this
Agreement and until the Closing Date.  Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of
any Casualty Loss of  which Seller becomes aware. If a Casualty Loss occurs
that  would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect  on the
Business, Seller will have the right to attempt to cure  such Casualty Loss
prior to Closing and to extend the Closing  Date for up to 45 days for such
purpose. If Seller refuses or  is unable to cure such Casualty Loss prior to
the Closing or  to reduce the Purchase Price by the amount as agreed to by 
Buyer and Seller, Buyer may terminate this Agreement by  providing to Seller
15 days written notice.   (b) Except as provided in subsection (a) above, if
any Casualty  Loss occurs prior to Closing to any of the Interests and such 
Casualty Loss may be repaired prior to Closing and, when  repaired, the value
of such Interests shall not be materially  diminished, then Seller may repair
such Casualty Loss prior to  Closing at Seller\'s cost and shall immediately
notify Buyer of  such election. If a Casualty Loss occurs prior to Closing, 
Buyer does not elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  subsection (a)
above and the Purchase Price is not reduced  under subsection (a) above, and
such repair is not completed  by Seller prior to Closing, then Buyer may
elect to (i) reduce  the Base Purchase Price by an amount estimated by Seller
and  agreed to by Buyer to be equal to the repair costs of the  Casualty
Loss; provided that, if the Parties cannot agree,  then either Party may
submit the determination of the repair  costs of the Casualty Loss to
arbitration pursuant to the  Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration  Association, and the repair costs as determined pursuant to 
such arbitration shall be the repair costs of the Casualty  Loss for purposes
of this clause (i), or (ii) accept the  Interests with the Casualty Loss with
no adjustment to the  Base Purchase Price, but with Buyer being entitled to
receive  as Buyer\'s sole property all insurance proceeds, condemnation  or
taking proceeds, and other proceeds or recoveries on  account of such
Casualty Loss. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if the Casualty Loss is in
excess of $5,000,000 then Seller  may elect to terminate this Agreement upon
15 days written  notice to Buyer.  20. Post-Closing Consents and Required
Consents.   (a) "Post-Closing Consents" means any consent, approval or
permit  of, or filing with or notice to, any third party that is 
customarily obtained or made after closing in connection with  transactions
similar in nature to the transactions  contemplated hereby.   (b) "Required
Consent" shall mean any rights to consent to an  assignment or transfer of an
Interest (other than Post-Closing  Consents) where the failure to receive
such    31     consent could materially and adversely affect, prevent
or  interfere with the ownership, operation, value or use of any  Interest
and the Business or cause Buyer to suffer or incur  any material loss or
damage, due consideration being given to  whether same is usual and
customarily acceptable to reasonable  and prudent persons engaged in the
business of ownership and  operation of gathering systems with knowledge of
all of the  facts and appreciation of their legal significance. Seller 
shall promptly give notices to all third parties holding any  Required
Consents known to Seller or identified to Seller by  Buyer prior to Closing.
Seller shall use all reasonable  efforts, but without obligation to incur any
unreasonable cost  or expense, to obtain such Required Consents. Unless
waived in  writing by Buyer, if a Required Consent with respect to an 
Interest is not obtained prior to Closing unless Seller  (without infringing
upon the legal rights of any third party  or outside party or violating any
law, rule, regulation or  permit) shall provide to Buyer an alternative
arrangement  which provides to Buyer the equivalent benefits of such 
nonassigned Interest (at no additional cost to Buyer other  than the
assumption with respect to such period of any related  liability and the
performance and compliance by Buyer with the  terms of such Interest), then
(x) the purchase price shall be  reduced prior to the Closing by the mutually
agreed reduction  in the value of the Val Verde System resulting from the
loss  of the affected Interest, and such Interest shall be excluded  from
the purchase and sale under this Agreement, or (y) Buyer  may terminate this
Agreement if the Parties are unable to  agree to a mutually acceptable
purchase price reduction  pursuant (x) and the failure to obtain such
Required Consent  would have an Adverse Title Effect. Any Required Consent 
waived in writing by Buyer shall be deemed a Permitted  Encumbrance.   (c)
"Adverse Title Effect" with respect to an Interest shall mean  that the
failure to obtain a Required Consent with respect to  such Interest will
materially and adversely affect, prevent or  interfere with the operation,
value or use of the Business or  cause Buyer to suffer or incur a material
loss or damage.   (d) If any Required Consent exists with respect to any of
the  Interests, then until such Required Consent is obtained and  such
Interest is assigned by Seller to Buyer:   (i) Seller agrees to use its
commercially reasonable  efforts (without infringing upon the legal rights
of  any third party or outside party or violating any  law, rule, regulation
or permit) to provide Buyer  with the equivalent assets or benefits of such 
retained Interest by subcontract or otherwise, at no  additional cost to
Buyer (other than the assumption  with respect to such period of any related
liability  and the performance and compliance by Buyer with the  terms of
such permit, license, easement, contract or  other property) effective as of
the Closing Date; and   (ii) Buyer agrees (without infringing upon the
legal  rights of such third party or outside party or  violating any law,
rule, regulation or permit) to  bear with respect to such period the economic
burden  of any related liability    32     and of the performance and
compliance with the terms  of the permit, license, easement, contract or
other  property subject to the Required Consent, at no  additional cost to
Seller, effective as of the  Closing Date to the same extent as Buyer would
have  borne such liability and other obligations if such  Required Consent
had been obtained and such retained  Interest had been assigned by Seller to
Buyer  effective as of the Closing Date.   Seller agrees (without
infringing upon the legal rights of  such third party or outside party or
violating any law, rule,  regulation or permit) to exercise its rights with
respect to  such retained Interest at the direction and/or for the benefit 
of Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this  subsection (d) or
subsection (e) below shall require or  obligate Seller or Buyer to purchase
or pay consideration to  acquire any new or additional permit, license,
easement,  contract or other property right or interest.   (e) Any failure
of Seller to obtain a Required Consent shall be  handled exclusively under
this Section 20 and will not be  treated as a Title Defect under Article 4 or
a breach of any  other sections of this Agreement.   (f) Without waiving
any of the Parties\' rights hereunder, this  Agreement shall not operate as
an assignment by Seller to  Buyer of any contract, permit, franchise, claim
or asset  included in the Interests that is by its valid and enforceable 
terms or by law nonassignable, without the consent of any  other party or
parties to such Interest or a Governmental  Entity, unless such consent or
approval shall have been given  21. Closing. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the  Closing shall occur effective at 11:59
p.m. (New Mexico Time) on June  30, 2002 at the offices of Seller at 5051
Westheimer, Suite 1400,  Houston, Texas, or at such other time and place as
Seller and Buyer may  mutually agree in writing (the "Closing" or the
"Closing Date"). If all  conditions to Closing have been satisfied or waived,
a pre-closing will  occur on June 28, 2002 at which time all Transaction
Agreements and  other closing documents will be executed and deposited into
escrow with  Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. ("Vinson and Elkins") and the Purchase
Price,  reduced by 3 days of interest at 4% per annum if the Purchase Price
is  wired by Buyer to Seller prior to 12:00 p.m. (Houston, Texas Time) on 
June 28, 2002 (and 2 days of interest if the Purchase Price is wired by 
Buyer to Seller after 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on June 28, 2002 unless  the
delay results from the activities of Seller), will be paid to  Seller. The
closing documents will be released by Vinson and Elkins to  Buyer and Seller,
respectively, on July 1, 2002 provided that no  "termination event" as
defined in the escrow agreement among Vinson and  Elkins, Buyer and Seller has
occurred. If a "termination event" as  defined in the escrow agreement among
Vinson and Elkins, Buyer and Seller  has occurred, then Vinson and Elkins will
promptly destroy the closing  documents and within one Business Day
thereafter Seller will wire back  to Buyer in immediately available funds the
amount wired by Buyer in  connection with the Pre-Closing.

this Agreement. Incidental and subsequent  to Closing, each of the Parties
shall execute, acknowledge, and deliver  to the other such further
instruments, and take such other actions as  may be reasonably necessary to
carry out the provisions of this  Agreement.  24. Proration of Taxes. All
ad valorem Taxes, real property Taxes, and  similar obligations attributable
to the Interests with respect to the  tax period in which the Effective Time
occurs (the "current tax  period") shall be apportioned between Seller and
Buyer as of the  Effective Time with Seller being obligated to pay a
proportionate share  of the actual amount of such Taxes for the current tax
period  determined by multiplying such actual Taxes by a fraction, the 
numerator of which is the number of days in the current tax period  prior to
the Effective Time and the denominator of which is the total  number of days
in the current tax period. An estimate of Seller\'s share  of such actual
Taxes for the current tax period shall be based on the  immediately preceding
tax period assessment, and the Base Purchase  Price paid at Closing shall be
reduced by the amount of such estimated  Taxes owed by Seller for that
portion of the current tax period prior  to the Effective Time. When the
actual amount of any such Taxes for the  current tax period is   
35     known, Buyer shall promptly advise Seller of the proportionate
share of  such actual Taxes for which Seller is obligated. If the estimate
of  Seller\'s share of such actual Taxes made pursuant to this Section was 
less than Seller\'s share of such actual Taxes, Seller shall pay Buyer  such
deficiency within 10 days of receipt of such notice, and if such  estimate
was more than Seller\'s share of such actual Taxes, Buyer will  refund such
excess to Seller at the time such notice is given. Except  for the ad valorem
Taxes, real property Taxes, and similar obligations  for the current tax
period which are prorated between Buyer and Seller  pursuant to this Section,
(i) Seller shall be obligated for, and shall  indemnify Buyer and its
Affiliates from and against, all other Taxes  relating to the ownership of
the Interests or conduct of the Business  which are attributable to the
period prior to the Effective Time, all  Claims with respect to such other
Taxes, and all Claims with respect to  Seller\'s share of Taxes for the
current tax period and (ii) Buyer shall  be obligated for, and shall
indemnify Seller and its Affiliates from  and against, all other Taxes
relating to the ownership of the Interests  or conduct of the Business which
are attributable to the period forward  after the Effective Time, all Claims
with respect to such other Taxes  and all Claims with respect to Buyer\'s
share of Taxes for the current  tax period. Except as specifically provided
in this Section 24 or in  Section 27, Buyer is not assuming responsibility
for any Taxes for  which Seller or any of its Affiliates are liable and,
subject to that  exception, (i) Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer  from and against all Taxes for which Seller is liable and
(ii) Buyer  shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against
all  Taxes for which Buyer is liable.  25. Credits and Receipts. Subject to
the terms hereof (including the  indemnification provisions hereof), all
monies, proceeds, receipts,  credits and income attributable to the Interests
(as determined in  accordance with GAAP) (i) for all periods of time from and
after the  Effective Time, shall be the sole property and entitlement of
Buyer,  and, to the extent received by Seller or one of its Affiliates,
shall  be promptly accounted for and transmitted to Buyer and (ii) for all 
periods of time prior to the Effective Time, shall be the sole property  and
entitlement of Seller and, to the extent received by Buyer, shall  be
promptly accounted for and transmitted to Seller. After Closing,  regardless
of when and by whom the actual invoice or demand for payment  is received,
(a) Seller shall pay and be responsible for all accounts  payable or overhead
or administrative costs incurred in the ordinary  course of business with
respect to the Interests or the Business and  attributable to any period of
time before the Effective Time and (b)  Buyer shall pay and be responsible
for all accounts payable or overhead  or administrative costs incurred in the
ordinary course of business  with respect to the Interests or the Business
and attributable to any  period of time after the Effective Time. Seller
shall pay and be  responsible for the amounts for which Seller is responsible
under  Sections 4(a)(ii)(B) and 4(a)(ii)(F).  26. Notices. All notices
hereunder shall be sufficiently given for all  purposes hereunder if in
writing and delivered personally, or to the  extent receipt is confirmed by
the Party charged with notice, sent by  documented overnight delivery
service, by United States mail, telecopy,  telefax or other electronic
transmission service to the appropriate  address or number as set forth
below. Notices to Seller or Buyer shall  be addressed to:

General Counsel  Phone: 713-759-3968  Fax: 713-759-3645   27. Transfer
Taxes. Seller and Buyer believe that this purchase and sale of  the Interests
constitutes an isolated or occasional sale and is not  subject to sales Tax;
provided, however, if any sales, transfers, use  Taxes or other similar Taxes
are due or should hereafter become due  (including penalty and interest
thereon) by reason of this transaction,  Buyer shall timely pay and solely
bear all such Taxes.  28. Recording Documents. Buyer shall pay all
documentary, filing, and  recording fees incurred in connection with the
filing and recording of  the instruments of conveyance. As soon as
practicable after Closing,  Buyer shall provide Seller with recorded copies
of all documents  conveying the Interests to Buyer.  29. Announcements.
Seller and Buyer shall consult with each other prior to  the release of any
press releases and other announcements concerning  this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing herein  shall prohibit a Party from
making a press release or other  announcement if required by applicable law
or the rules or regulations  of a stock exchange; however, the Party required
to make the  announcement agrees to use reasonable efforts to consult with
the other  Party in connection with such release or filing. Any press release
or  other announcement shall be at a time and in a form reasonably 
acceptable to Seller and Buyer.  30. Survival of Representations, Warranties
and Covenants. Except as  otherwise provided herein, all covenants of the
Parties to the extent  not fully performed or waived prior to Closing shall
survive the  Closing; except to the extent their survival is expressly
limited by  another provision of this Agreement, including Section 10(b)
above. All  representations and warranties of the Parties (except for the 
representation and warranty of Seller in Section 7(w)) shall survive  the
Closing subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10(b) and  except
that Section 8 (other than subsection (b), (c) and (h) thereof)  shall
survive Closing until two years after Closing. The representation  and
warranty of Seller in Section 7(w) shall not survive the Closing  and shall
have no force and effect following the Closing; provided,  that in the event
that breaches of Section    37     7(w) at Closing represent
Environmental Liabilities in excess of  $5,000,000, in the aggregate, then
Buyer can terminate this Agreement  by written notice to Seller.  31.
Reliance. Prior to executing and closing this Agreement, Buyer has been 
afforded an opportunity to (i) examine the Interests and such materials  as
it has requested to be provided to it by Seller, (ii) to discuss  with
representatives of Seller such materials and the nature and  operation of the
Interests and (iii) to investigate the condition of  the Interests. In
entering into and closing this Agreement, Buyer has  relied solely on the
express representations and covenants of Seller in  this Agreement and the
instruments of conveyance, its independent  investigation of, and judgment
with respect to, the Interests, and the  advice of its own legal, tax,
economic, environmental, engineering,  pipeline and treating plant advisors,
and not on any comments or  statements of Seller or any representatives or
agents of, or  consultants or advisors engaged by, Seller.  32. Dispute
Resolution. The Parties shall attempt to promptly resolve any  controversy or
claim between the Parties hereto arising out of or  relating to this
Agreement or any related agreements, transactions, or  instruments. If any
controversy or claim should arise, the Parties  shall meet and attempt to
resolve the matter by negotiation. Such  negotiation shall be held between
officers of both Parties, each having  the authority to settle the
controversy or claim. If any such  controversy or claim is not resolved by
negotiation, the Parties will  attempt to negotiate an agreement for
alternate method resolution (such  as mediation) before initiating an action
for judicial relief.  33. Failure to Close. Subject to the other provisions
of this Section, if  all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections
5, 6 and 35  hereof have not been satisfied or waived by the respective
Parties on  or before August 31, 2002 (or such later date as this Agreement
may be  extended by Buyer or Seller pursuant to the express terms hereof, or
as  hereafter may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties in writing), this 
Agreement shall terminate automatically, and no Party hereto shall have  any
further obligations or any liability to the other Party pursuant to  this
Agreement; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve  any Party
from liability for the willful failure to satisfy any  conditions to Closing
required to be satisfied by it. Upon any  termination of this Agreement,
Seller shall be free immediately to  enjoy all rights of ownership of the
Interests and to sell, transfer,  encumber or otherwise dispose of the
Interests to any Person without  any restriction under this Agreement.  34.
Use of Seller Names. Buyer agrees that, as soon as practicable after  Closing
(and in any event within 120 days), it will remove or cause to  be removed
the names and marks Burlington Resources, Meridian Oil, El  Paso Production,
or Southland Royalty where and if they exist, and all  variations and
derivatives thereof and logos relating thereto from the  Interests and will
not thereafter make any use whatsoever of such  names, marks, and
logos.  35. Regulatory Filings; Hart-Scott-Rodino Filing.   (a) Buyer and
Seller will take all commercially reasonable actions  necessary or desirable,
and proceed diligently and in good  faith and use all commercially reasonable
efforts, as promptly  as practicable to obtain all consents, approvals
or    38     actions of, to make all filings with, and to give all
notices  to, Governmental Entities required to accomplish the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) This Agreement is subject in all
respects to and conditioned  upon compliance by the Parties with the HSR Act,
to the extent  that the HSR Act is applicable to the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties shall make such  filings on or
prior to May 24, 2002 and provide such  information to the Federal Trade
Commission ("FTC") and their  attorneys as is required in connection with the
HSR Act as  soon as practicable after a request therefor. In no event will 
Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer be obligated to divest any  assets in
connection with obtaining any waiver or approval  under the HSR Act.   (c)
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, each of  the Parties
will (i) use reasonable efforts to comply as  expeditiously as possible with
all lawful requests of  government entities for additional information and
documents  pursuant to the HSR Act, (ii) not (A) extend any waiting  period
under the HSR Act or (B) enter into any voluntary  agreement with any
Governmental Entity not to consummate the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except with the  prior consent of the other Party, and (iii)
cooperate with  each other and use reasonable efforts to obtain the
requisite  approval of the FTC and Justice Department, including without 
limitation (A) the execution, delivery and performance by the  appropriate
entity of such divestiture agreements or other  actions, as the case may be,
as may be reasonably necessary to  secure the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting  periods under the HSR Act, (B) the removal,
dissolution, stay  or dismissal of any temporary restraining order,
preliminary  injunction or other judicial or administrative order which 
prevents the consummation of the transactions contemplated  hereby or
requires as a condition thereto that all or any part  of the Business be held
separate or (C) the pursuit of  necessary litigation or administrative
proceedings (including,  if necessary, participation in proceedings through
the trial  court level).   (d) Each Party will be responsible for paying
its respective  filing fees required with respect to any filing under the
HSR  Act.  36. Preservation of Records. For a period of seven (7) years
after the  Closing Date, the Party in possession of the originals of the
Records  will retain such Records and will make such Records available to
the  other Party upon reasonable notice for inspection and/or copying, at 
the expense of the requesting Party, at the headquarters of the Party  in
possession (or at such other location in the United States as the  Party in
possession may designate in writing to the other Party) at  reasonable times
and during regular office hours. Neither Party shall  have any liability to
the other Party for the inadvertent destruction  by mistake or oversight of
any Records required to be preserved  pursuant to this Section. If Buyer, at
any time, proposes to transfer  the Interests directly or indirectly, to a
third party, then Buyer will  provide notice of such proposal to Seller and
permit Seller a  reasonable opportunity to make copies of the Records.   
39    37. Right of First Refusal. Buyer shall not sell, transfer,
assign,  exchange, voluntarily surrender or otherwise dispose of the Val
Verde  System or any part thereof to any Person, other than a Permitted 
Transferee, except after strict compliance with the terms hereof (any  such
disposition being herein referred to as a "Subject Transfer"). For  the
purposes hereof, a Subject Transfer shall (i) include any sale or  transfer
to any Person, whether by merger, business combination,  transfer of
securities or otherwise or any sale or transfer of any  entity all or
substantially all of whose assets consist of the Val  Verde System; and (ii)
exclude any sale, transfer, assignment,  exchange, abandonment, surrender or
other disposition in the ordinary  course of business of any real property,
personal property, contracts,  well ties, equipment, materials and supplies
not constituting a  material part of the Val Verde System. Any assignee of
the Interests or  any part thereof (except for the exclusions specified above
or as may  otherwise be agreed by Seller in writing) shall receive the
Interests  subject to this continuing right of first refusal and shall be
required  to enter into and deliver to Seller a letter acknowledging the 
agreement of such assignee that the Interests will remain subject to  this
right of first refusal following such assignment. In the event  that Buyer
plans to pursue a Subject Transfer it will provide written  notice to Seller
of such intentions at least 30 days prior to accepting  any Subject Transfer
proposal. Furthermore, at least 10 days prior to  consummating a Subject
Transfer, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a notice  (a "Transfer Notice")
containing full information concerning the  Subject Transfer that it proposes
to make, including the purchase price  and all other material terms on which
Buyer proposes to make the  Subject Transfer. Seller shall have a period of
ten days after receipt  of the Transfer Notice from Buyer to exercise its
option to purchase on  the same terms and conditions. If Seller does not
timely elect to  exercise its option to purchase on the terms and conditions
set forth  in said Transfer Notice in accordance with the foregoing, then,
Buyer  may make a Subject Transfer for the same or a higher purchase price 
and, in all material respects, on the same or clearly better terms than  were
specified in such Transfer Notice at any time within three months  (as may be
extended by any delay in obtaining regulatory approvals but  not beyond an
additional three months) after the expiration of Seller\'s  10-day option
period, but any later sale or any sale for a different  purchase price or on
different terms than permitted above must again be  offered to Seller in
accordance with the above terms of this Section.  Copies of all agreements
and other documentation evidencing any Subject  Transfer to any Person other
than Seller must be furnished to Seller no  later than 15 Business Days after
the date such Subject Transfer is  completed. A Permitted Transferee shall be
Duke Energy Field Services,  LLC or its direct or indirect subsidiaries,
Texas Eastern Products  Pipeline Company, LLC or its direct or indirect
subsidiaries, and  TEPPCO Partners, L.P. or its direct or indirect
subsidiaries.  38. Supplements to Disclosure Schedules. If, to Seller\'s
knowledge, after  the date hereof and prior to Closing any event occurs or
condition  changes that causes any of their representations or warranties in
this  Agreement to be inaccurate, Seller will promptly notify Buyer thereof 
in writing. Such supplement and disclosure shall not be deemed to be a  part
of Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule for purposes of determining if the 
conditions to Closing have been satisfied but shall be deemed to be  included
in Seller Disclosure Schedule if Closing shall occur;  provided, however,
that such supplement and disclosure shall not be  deemed to be a part of
Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule if such event or  change (i) arises from a
breach by Seller of any of its covenants under  this Agreement, (ii) has a
material adverse effect on the Business or  the Interests, or (iii)   
40     constitutes a matter which a reasonable and prudent similarly
situated  pipeline operator would not have accepted had it known about the
same  at the time of execution of this Agreement.  39. Buyer\'s Post-
Closing Covenant. Buyer agrees that it shall not, and  shall not permit any
of its Affiliates to conduct any invasive  environmental site assessments
(other than for those areas or  conditions identified in Schedule O) for two
years following the  Closing, the effect of which would reasonably be
expected to impose any  additional material obligation on Seller under
Schedule 14(e) to the  Seller Disclosure Schedule, unless conducting such
site assessment  would be in the ordinary course of business of Buyer or its
Affiliates  pursuant to Buyer\'s adopted operating policies applicable
generally to  the Val Verde System and to other similar assets owned by Buyer
or its  Affiliates as opposed to a policy directed primarily at the Val
Verde  System or any part thereof or consistent with good industry
practice.  40. Miscellaneous   (a) Capitalized terms as used in this
Agreement shall have the  meanings prescribed in Annex A attached hereto
and  incorporated by reference.   (b) This Agreement may be executed by
Buyer and Seller in any  number of counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an  original instrument, but all of which together shall  constitute
one and the same instrument.   (c) Time is of the essence in this
Agreement.   (d) Any of the terms, provisions, covenants, representations, 
warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a  written instrument
executed by the Party waiving compliance.  The failure of any Party at any
time or times to require  performance of any provisions hereof shall in no
manner affect  such Party\'s right to enforce the same. No waiver of any of 
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall  constitute a
waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or  not similar), nor shall
such waiver constitute a continuing  waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided.   (e) This instrument states the entire agreement and supersedes
all  prior agreements (except the Confidentiality Agreement)  between the
Parties concerning the subject matter hereof. This  Agreement may be
supplemented, altered, amended, modified or  revoked by writing only, signed
by both Parties.   (f) This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the
Parties  hereto shall be governed, construed, and enforced in  accordance
with the laws of the State of Texas, except as the  laws of any other
jurisdiction mandatorily apply. The Parties  agree that any litigation
relating directly or indirectly to  this Agreement must be brought before and
determined by a  court of competent jurisdiction within Harris County,
Texas.   (g) This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person not
a  Party hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, and no person,  other than
the Parties hereto, is    41     entitled to rely on any
representation, covenant, or agreement  contained herein. The Seller Parties
and the Buyer Parties are  not third party beneficiaries of this Agreement.
Any claim on  behalf of a Seller Party for indemnification under this 
Agreement can only be made and administered by Seller and any  claim on
behalf of a Buyer Party for indemnification under  this Agreement can only be
made and administered by Buyer.   (h) If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid,  illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or  public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this 
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect  so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions  contemplated hereby is not
affected in any adverse manner to  any Party. Upon such determination that
any term or other  provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced,  the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify  this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the  Parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner to the  end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to  the extent possible.   (i) All the
terms, provisions, covenants, representations, and  conditions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure  to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties hereto and  their respective successors; provided,
however, this Agreement  or any portion thereof and the rights and
obligations  hereunder shall not be assignable or delegable by any Party, 
without the express prior written consent of the non-assigning  or non-
delegating Party; provided, however, Buyer may, without  consent, make any
such assignment or delegation to any  Permitted Transferee. All assignments
permitted or consented  to hereunder (i) shall be, and by their terms shall
expressly  provide that they are, subject to the rights of the other  Party
under this Agreement, (ii) shall require that the  assignee agree to be bound
by and perform all obligations of  the assigning Party hereunder with respect
to the interest so  assigned, and (iii) shall not release the assigning Party
or  its predecessor Parties in interest under this Agreement from  their
obligations under this Agreement.   (j) Should either Party default in the
performance of this  Agreement, the other Party shall be entitled to
enforce  specific performance of this Agreement, or exercise any other 
right or remedy it may have at law or in equity by reason of  such
default.   (k) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and  drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or  question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement  shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no  presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or  disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any
of  the provisions of this Agreement. If the date specified in  this
Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is  not a Business Day
(or if the period during which any notices  required to be given or any
action taken expires on a date  which is not a Business Day), then the date
for giving such  notice or taking such action (and the expiration date for
