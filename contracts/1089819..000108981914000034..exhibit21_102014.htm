by and among Como 1 L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Parent"), Como 3

Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Cleco Corporation, a Louisiana corporation (the
"Company").

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company on the terms and conditions set forth herein (the "Merger");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (i) determined that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, are
fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, (ii)
adopted, approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend the
approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company;

WHEREAS, the general partner of Parent and the Board of Directors of Merger
Sub have, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
adopted, approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger; and

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER



Section 1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company in accordance with the Louisiana Business Corporation Law
(the "LBCL"). At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in
the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Louisiana and shall succeed to and
assume all of the rights and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub in
accordance with the LBCL and shall become, as a result of the Merger, an
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

Section 1.02 Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to Section 7.01, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the later of (a) the fifth (5th)
Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at such time) and (b) the fifth (5th) Business Day after the final
day of the Marketing Period or such earlier date as may be specified by Parent
on no less than five (5) Business Days' prior notice to the Company, unless



another time or date is agreed to by the parties hereto (such date, the
"Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at such location as is agreed to by
the parties hereto.

Section 1.03 Effective Time of the Merger. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, on the Closing Date, the parties thereto shall file articles of
merger (the "Articles of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Louisiana in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
LBCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as is specified in the
Articles of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being hereinafter
referred to as the "Effective Time").

Section 1.04 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall generally have the
effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the LBCL.

Section 1.05 Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

(a) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable law, in each
case consistent with the obligations set forth in Section 5.05.

(b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and
applicable law, in each case consistent with the obligations set forth in
Section 5.05.

Section 1.06 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

(a) The parties shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary so
that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



Section 2.01 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common
Stock (a "Share" and collectively, the "Shares") that is (i) owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent,
or (ii) owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company (and in each



case not held on behalf of third parties (but not including Shares held by any
"rabbi trust" or other trust or similar arrangement in respect of any
compensation plan or arrangement)) shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. Each Dissenting Share shall only represent the right to receive the
payment to which reference is made in Section 2.04. Each Share referred to in
clause (i) or (ii) of the second preceding sentence, and each Dissenting
Share, is referred to herein as an "Excluded Share" and collectively,
"Excluded Shares").

(b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each Share (other than Excluded
Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into the right to receive $55.37 per Share in cash, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all of the
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "Certificate")
representing any Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and each non-certificated
Share represented by book-entry (a "Book-Entry Share") (other than Excluded
Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.01(b) paid in consideration
therefor upon the surrender of Certificates or receipt of an "agent's message"
in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest.

(c) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all
certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for
all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

Section 2.02 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to or concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by
Parent with the Company's prior written approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the "Paying Agent"), for the
benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), a cash amount
in immediately available funds equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration
(the "Exchange Fund"). The Paying Agent agreement pursuant to which Parent
shall engage the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company. Funds made available to the Paying Agent shall be
invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent; provided that such
investments shall be in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America, (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's, respectively, (iii)
deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or banker's acceptances of,
repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits
purchased from, commercial banks, each of which has capital, surplus and
undivided profits aggregating more than $1.0 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available at the SEC
or otherwise), (iv) money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized



credit rating agency at the time of investment or (v) a combination of the
foregoing, in each case, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the
holders of Shares pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and
any amounts in excess of the level required to make prompt cash payment of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be promptly returned to the Surviving
Corporation. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Paying Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the cash contemplated to be paid
pursuant to this Section 2.02, out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. To the extent that there are losses
with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other
reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other
events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a
level sufficient for the Paying Agent to promptly make such cash payments.

(b) Procedures for Surrender.

(i) Certificates. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within
five (5) Business Days), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A)
a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify after
consultation with the Company and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form with respect to such
Certificates, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of Shares formerly represented by such Certificates,
and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement shall not be required to deliver a Certificate
or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Agreement. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one of more Book-Entry
Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement shall, upon
receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's message" (or such other evidence,
if any, of surrender as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares formerly represented by such
Book-Entry Shares. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-
Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry
Shares are registered.



(iii) Transfer of Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made and the Merger Consideration may be issued to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment pays any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate and each
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration into which the Shares theretofore represented by such
Certificate or such Book-Entry Share have been converted pursuant to Section
2.01(b). No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer
Books. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this Article II upon surrender of any Shares
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein
or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and, subject to the procedures set
forth in Section 2.02(b), exchanged as provided in this Article II, except as
otherwise required by law.

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest or other income received by the Paying
Agent with respect to all of the funds made available to it) that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Shares for one (1) year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any holders of the Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as general
creditor thereof (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar
laws) for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration.

(e) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.02(d),
none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent or
any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be
liable to any holder of a Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. If any Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 2.02(g)) shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which
the Merger Consideration represented by such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such
Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



(f) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares,
Company Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the
Effective Time such amounts as the Paying Agent may be required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other provision of applicable
federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be (i) remitted by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

(g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent shall issue, or pay or cause to be paid, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, an amount (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.02(f)) equal to (i) the
number of Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration.

(h) Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the event that the Company changes the
number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, subdivision, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 2.02(h) shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to
effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to
undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.03 Treatment of Stock Plans. The Company will take all actions
necessary to effect the following, including obtaining consent of applicable
holders of relevant equity awards:

(a) Company Restricted Stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
unvested Share of Company Restricted Stock granted pursuant to any equity
incentive plan or arrangement of the Company, including the Cleco Corporation
2010 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended, and the Cleco
Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), as amended, and any
other compensatory plan, program or arrangement under which Shares are
reserved for issuance (collectively, the "Company Employee Stock Plans")
shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest in full, and
all restrictions (including forfeiture restrictions or repurchase rights)
otherwise applicable to such Shares of Company Restricted Stock shall lapse,
and each Share of Company Restricted Stock shall be converted into the right
to receive a payment in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, without
interest (subject to any withholding in accordance with Section 2.02(f));
provided, however, that (i) in



the case of any Company Restricted Stock subject to performance-based vesting
conditions as of the Effective Time, the applicable performance criteria shall
be deemed to have been satisfied based on target level of attainment without
proration for the early termination (if any) of the applicable performance
period, and (ii) in the case of any Company Restricted Stock granted after the
date hereof, such grant shall vest in accordance with its terms.

(b) Treatment of Restricted Stock Units. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each restricted stock unit, performance stock unit and dividend
equivalent unit (collectively, "Restricted Stock Units"), granted pursuant to
any Company Employee Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
vest in full, and all restrictions (including forfeiture restrictions or
repurchase rights) otherwise applicable to such Restricted Stock Unit shall
lapse, and each Restricted Stock Unit shall be entitled to receive, in
settlement therefor and full satisfaction thereof, a payment in cash (subject
to any withholding in accordance with Section 2.02(f)) equal to the product of
(i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such
Restricted Stock Unit. In the case of any Restricted Stock Units that
constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the
Code, payment shall occur on the date that it would otherwise occur under the
applicable plan or award agreement absent the application of this Section 2.03
to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any penalty or other Taxes
under Section 409A of the Code. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any
cash payable with respect to any Restricted Stock Unit.

(c) Treatment of ESPP. In accordance with the terms of the ESPP, the "Offering
Period" under the ESPP shall terminate as of the date hereof and all
outstanding options under the ESPP shall be immediately exercised as of the
date hereof. The Company shall take such actions as necessary to provide that
(i) no new "Offering Period" shall commence following the date hereof, and
(ii) the ESPP shall terminate no later than as of the Effective Time, and to
return all ESPP participants' accumulated payroll deductions thereunder to the
extent not used to exercise options, and no further purchase rights shall be
granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter.

(d) Termination of Company Employee Stock Plans. After the Effective Time, all
Company Employee Stock Plans shall be terminated and no further Shares of
Company Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or other rights with respect
to Shares shall be granted hereunder.

Section 2.04 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the LBCL, Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by shareholders who filed written objections with the Company and voted
against the Merger at the Company Shareholders Meeting and who shall have
demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Shares in accordance with
12:131 of the LBCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration.
Such shareholders shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions
of 12:131 of the LBCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by shareholders
who shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Shares
under 12:131 of the LBCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective



Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly
evidenced such Shares or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in the manner provided
in Section 2.02. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub (a) prompt
written notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
LBCL and received by the Company relating to the right to receive the
appraised value of Dissenting Shares and (b) the opportunity to participate in
and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the LBCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal
of any Shares or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting. The Company (A) maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to provide
reasonable assurance that all information required to be disclosed by the

who have a significant role in the Company's internal control over financial
reporting, and the information described in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y)

business consistent with past practice, (ii) there has not been any change,
event or development that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or could

provided or reserved against in the audited consolidated balance sheet (or

consolidated subsidiaries (including the notes thereto). Neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a
party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar
contract or arrangement (including any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Company and any of its subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand), or
any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K under the Exchange Act), where the result, purpose or effect of such
contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction

with the continuation coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA

received a determination from the IRS that such Company Employee Benefit Plan
is so qualified, and, to the knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred
since the date of such determination that could adversely affect the
qualification of such Company Employee Benefit Plan.

(iv) Except as set forth on Section 3.01(l)(iv) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any member of the Controlled Group maintains,
sponsors, contributes to, has any obligation to contribute to, or has any
liability or potential liability under or with respect to (A) any "defined

timely paid.

(vi) Except as could not reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to the Company or any of its subsidiaries: (A) none of the Company,
a Controlled Group member, or any current or former employee, director or
officer of any of them, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other "party
in interest" or "disqualified person" (as such terms are defined in ERISA and
the Code) with respect to a Company Employee Benefit Plan has engaged in a
non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 406 of ERISA; (B) there has not been a breach of fiduciary
duty (as determined under ERISA) by any of the Company, a Controlled Group
member or any current or former employee, director or officer of any of them,
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other person with respect to any
Company Employee Benefit Plan; and (C) no action, investigation, audit, suit,
proceeding, hearing or claim with respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits) is pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened.

(vii) Section 3.01(l)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Letter identifies each
Company Employee Benefit Plan that provides, upon the occurrence of a change
in the ownership or effective control of the Company or its subsidiaries or a
change in the ownership of all or a substantial portion of the assets of the
Company or its subsidiaries, either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events and whether or not applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for (A) an acceleration of the
time of funding, payment of or vesting in, or an increase in the amount of,
compensation or benefits due any current or former employee, director or
officer of the Company or its subsidiaries, (B) any forgiveness of
indebtedness or obligation to fund compensation or benefits with respect to
any such employee, director or officer or (C) an entitlement of any such

deferred compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code (A) materially
complies and, at all times after December 31, 2011 has materially complied,
both in form and operation, with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code
and the final regulations thereunder and (B) between January 1, 2009 and
December 31, 2011 was operated in material reasonable, good faith compliance
with Section 409A of the Code, as determined under applicable guidance of the
United States Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury") and the IRS.

Code.

reasonably expect to incur any liability arising in connection with the
termination of, or a complete or partial withdrawal from, any "multiemployer

(xi) Any individual who performs services for the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and who is not treated as an employee for federal income tax
purposes by the Company or its subsidiaries is not an employee under
applicable law or for any purpose including, without limitation, for Tax
withholding purposes or Company Employee Benefit Plan participation purposes.
The Company and its subsidiaries have no liability by reason of an individual
who performs or performed services for the Company or its subsidiaries in any
capacity being improperly excluded from participating in a Company Employee
Benefit Plan.

(m) Labor Matters. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party
to, or bound by any collective bargaining agreement or other labor agreement
with any union or labor organization. To the knowledge of the Company, there
are no activities or proceedings (other than infrequent, isolated activities
involving a small number of employees) by any union or labor organization to
organize any employees of the Company, and no such activities or proceedings
have occurred within the past five (5) years. Since December 31, 2010, there
has been no work stoppage, strike, slowdown, lockout or any other material
labor dispute by or affecting employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such action has been
threatened. Since January 1, 2010, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has engaged in any "plant closing" or "mass layoff," as defined
in the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act or any comparable
state or local law.

could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company. With respect to such Environmental Permits:

Authority or any third party that any construction or modification of the
Company's, its subsidiaries' or the Company Joint Ventures' currently leased,
operated, managed or owned facilities prior to the Closing Date has triggered,

Permit; and

actions, suits, arbitrations or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of

(g) Financing.

(i) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of
an executed debt commitment letter, dated on or about the date of this
Agreement (the "Debt Commitment Letter"), and corresponding engagement (the
"Engagement Letter") and fee letters (with only the fee and certain other
economic provisions (none of which would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination, principal amount or
availability of the Debt Financing) redacted) from each of the lenders
identified therein (the "Debt Financing Sources") (such commitment letter,
including all exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements and amendments thereto
and each such redacted fee letter, collectively, the "Debt Financing
Commitments"), pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have committed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide debt financing in the
amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "Debt Financing"). As of the
date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a material default or material breach
on



the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other
party to the Debt Financing Commitments, under any term or condition therein
or that would, individually or in the aggregate, permit the financial
institutions party thereto to terminate, or not to make available, the Debt
Financing upon satisfaction of all conditions thereto.

(ii) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of
an executed equity commitment letter, dated on or about the date of this
Agreement (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements and
amendments thereto, the "Equity Financing Commitment" and, together with the
Debt Financing Commitments, the "Financing Commitments") from the Guarantors
pursuant to which the Guarantors have committed, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to invest in Parent, directly or indirectly, the amounts
set forth therein (the "Equity Financing" and, together with the Debt
Financing, the "Financing").

(iii) Except as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments, as of the
date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other agreements,
Contracts or arrangements to which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
affiliates is a party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of
the Financing which could adversely affect the amount, availability or
conditions of the Financing, other than any customary engagement letters and
non-disclosure agreements that do not impact the conditionality of the
Financing or the amount of the Financing. Assuming satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.01 and Section 6.03 and the commencement and
completion of the Marketing Period, Parent and Merger Sub do not have any
reason to believe, as of the date of this Agreement, that they will be unable
to satisfy all material terms and conditions to be satisfied by it with
respect to any of the Financing Commitments at the time it is required to
consummate the Closing hereunder, nor does Parent or Merger Sub have
knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, that the Financing will not be
available to Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing Date in accordance with its
terms and conditions. There are no conditions precedent related to the funding
of the full amount of the Financing other than as set forth in or contemplated
by the Financing Commitments.

(iv) Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing
Commitments, the aggregate net proceeds contemplated by the Financing
Commitments, together with the cash and cash equivalents of the Company and
the Company's subsidiaries, shall provide Parent and Merger Sub with cash
proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of all of
Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s payment obligations under this Agreement and under
the Financing Commitments, including the payment of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration and any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger and the Financing, in
each case at the Closing.

(v) As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments are in full
force and effect and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto,
enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as such enforcement may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws relating to creditors' rights generally, and general
equitable principles) and, as of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to
satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent or Merger Sub



or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the terms and
conditions of the Financing Commitments. Parent has paid in full any and all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the
Financing Commitments on or before the date of this Agreement. As of the date
hereof, (i) none of the Financing Commitments has been modified, amended or
altered, and, except as contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments, no
such modification, amendment or alteration to the Debt Financing Commitments
is contemplated by Parent or Merger Sub, and (ii) none of the respective
commitments under any of the Financing Commitments have been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded.

(h) Solvency. Based on information available to Parent as of the date of this
Agreement, assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's and Merger
Sub's obligation to consummate the Merger, (ii) the material accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement (without
giving effect to any materiality, material adverse effect or knowledge
qualification) and material compliance by the Company with the covenants
contained in this Agreement and (iii) the accuracy of all financial
information and forecasts of the Company and its subsidiaries made available
to Parent prior to the date hereof (notwithstanding the limitations set forth
in Section 3.02(m)), as of the Effective Time and immediately following the
Closing (and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Financing, any alternative financing and the payment
of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, any other repayment or refinancing of
debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Commitments, payment of
all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and payment of all related fees and
expenses), the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent.

(i) Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities. Merger Sub was formed solely
for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and activities incidental thereto. All of the outstanding capital stock of
Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time, will be owned directly or indirectly
by Parent. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with
its incorporation, as contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise relating to
the Financing, Merger Sub has not, and prior to the Effective Time will not
have, incurred, directly or indirectly through any subsidiary or affiliate,
any obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any
type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with
any person.

(j) Absence of Certain Arrangements. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor
any of its controlled affiliates has entered into any Contract, or authorized,
committed or agreed to enter into any Contract, with any director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any beneficial owner of
more than five percent (5%) of the Company Common Stock, relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time.

(k) Brokers. As of the date hereof, none of Parent or Merger Sub, nor any of

transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which the Company would have
any liability prior to the Effective Time.



(l) Limited Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the limited guarantee of each
of the parties to the Equity Financing Commitment (the "Guarantors"), dated as
of the date hereof, in favor of the Company with respect to certain
obligations of Parent under this Agreement on the terms specified therein
(including all exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements and amendments
thereto, the "Limited Guarantee"). As of the date of this Agreement, the
Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal,
valid, binding and enforceable obligation of each respective Guarantor, except
as such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors' rights
generally, and general equitable principles, and no event has occurred, which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on
the part of the Guarantors under the Limited Guarantee.

(m) Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-Looking
Statements and Business Plans. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan and cost-related plan information, regarding the
Company, its subsidiaries and their respective business and operations. Parent
and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking information, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that
Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such business
plans and cost-related plans, so furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans).

nor any of its subsidiaries, nor any of their respective shareholders,
members, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or
Representatives, nor any other person, has made or is making any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-
related plans).

provided, however, that this Section 4.02 shall not prohibit the Company, at
any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval,
from furnishing nonpublic information regarding the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to, or entering into or participating in discussions or
negotiations with, any person (and such person's Representatives) in response
to an unsolicited, written Company Takeover Proposal made after the date
hereof that the Company Board or any committee thereof concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Superior Proposal, if (A) such Company Takeover Proposal did not result from a
breach of this Section 4.02, (B) the Company Board or any committee thereof
concludes in good faith that, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result

executed confidentiality and standstill agreement between the Company and such
person containing terms and conditions that are no less restrictive in any
material respect to the other party than those contained in the

Agreement"), between Macquarie Infrastructure Partners III, L.P. and the
Company and (D) the Company promptly makes available to Parent any material
non-public information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries that is

consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company owning, operating or controlling a Company Material
Business, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 4.02(a)
shall prohibit the Company or its directors, officers or Representatives from
contacting any person who has made a Company Takeover Proposal solely to
request the clarification of the terms and conditions thereof to the extent
necessary to permit the Company Board or applicable committee to determine
whether such Company Takeover Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to
result in, a Company Superior Proposal. The Company agrees that in the event
any of its subsidiaries or Representatives takes any action which, if taken by
the Company, would constitute a breach of this Section 4.02, the Company shall
be deemed to be in breach of this Section 4.02.

(b) The Company shall promptly, and in no event later than 24 hours after its
receipt of any Company Takeover Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, advise Parent

providing the identity of the person or group of persons making or submitting
such Company Takeover Proposal or request, and, (i) if it is in



writing, a copy of such Company Takeover Proposal and any related draft
agreements or (ii) if it is oral, a reasonably detailed summary thereof). The
Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis (and in no
event later than twenty-four (24) hours following any such change) with
respect to any change to the material terms of any such Company Takeover
Proposal.

(c) Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause
its subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors and
employees, and shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations between the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
Representatives and any person (other than Parent) that relate to any Company
Takeover Proposal and shall deliver a written notice to each such person to
the effect that the Company is ending all activities, discussions and
negotiations with such person with respect to any actual or potential Company
Takeover Proposal, effective on the date of this Agreement, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts, including the exercise of any contractual rights of
the Company or its subsidiaries, to obtain the prompt return or destruction of
any confidential information previously furnished to such persons within
twelve (12) months of the date hereof.

(d) Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 4.02(e) or (f), none of
the Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof may (i) (A) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify, the recommendation of the Company Board that the Company's
shareholders approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Company Recommendation"), (B) fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (C) recommend or otherwise
declare advisable or propose to recommend, or otherwise declare advisable
(publicly or otherwise), any Company Takeover Proposal, or (D) fail to
publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days
after Parent so requests in writing (any of the foregoing, a "Company Change
of Recommendation"); or (ii) enter into a letter of intent, agreement in
principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, asset or share
purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 4.02(a))
(a "Takeover Agreement") providing for any transaction or series of
transactions involving a Company Takeover Proposal (a "Company Takeover
Transaction").

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
Board or any committee thereof may, at any time prior to receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, (i) effect a Company Change of Recommendation in
respect of a Company Takeover Proposal; and (ii) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.01(h) in order to enter into a written definitive
agreement providing for a Company Takeover Transaction, in the case of clause
(i) and clause (ii) if: (A) a Company Takeover Proposal is made to the Company
after the date of this Agreement and has not been withdrawn; (B) such Company
Takeover Proposal did not result from any breach of Section 4.02; (C) the
Company Board or applicable committee thereof determines in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such
offer constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and that failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable law; (D) the Company provides Parent four
(4) Business Days' prior written notice of



its intention to take such action, which notice shall include the information
with respect to such Company Superior Proposal that is specified in Section
4.02(b) (it being understood that any material revision or amendment to the
terms of such Company Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and, in
such case, all references to four (4) Business Days in this Section 4.02(e)
shall be deemed to be three (3) Business Days); (E) during the applicable
period described in clause (D) (the "Takeover Notice Period"), the Company
negotiates in good faith with Parent and its Representatives, if requested by
Parent, regarding any adjustments or modifications to the terms of this
Agreement; and (F) at the end of the Takeover Notice Period, the Company Board
or applicable committee again makes the determination in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and after
taking into account any adjustments or modifications proposed in writing by
Parent during the Takeover Notice Period), that the Company Takeover Proposal
continues to be a Company Superior Proposal and determines that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Company Superior Proposal" means any written Company Takeover
Proposal that the Company Board or committee thereof determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, to
be more favorable (taking into account (i) all financial and strategic
considerations, including legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of
such Company Takeover Proposal and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement deemed relevant by the Company Board (or
applicable committee), (ii) the identity of the third party making such
Company Takeover Proposal and (iii) the conditions, prospects and timing for
completion of such Company Takeover Proposal) to the Company's shareholders
than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(taking into account all of the terms of any proposal by Parent to amend or
modify the terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), except that (A) the references to "20%" in clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) of the definition of "Company Takeover Proposal" in Section 4.02(a)
shall each be deemed to be a reference to "75%", (B) a "Company Takeover
Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving the
Company, and not any of its subsidiaries or Company Material Businesses alone,
and (C) the references to "or any subsidiary of the Company owning, operating
or controlling a Company Material Business" in clauses (ii) and (iv) shall be
deemed to be deleted.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
Board or any committee thereof may, at any time prior to the receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, effect a Company Change of Recommendation in
response to any event, change, effect, development, condition or occurrence
that affects or would reasonably be likely to affect the business, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, that (i) is material, individually or in the aggregate with any
other such events, changes, effects, developments, conditions or occurrences,
(ii) does not involve or relate to a Company Takeover Proposal, the Required
Regulatory Approvals or Parent and (iii) is not known nor reasonably
foreseeable as of or prior to the date hereof if: (x) the Company provides
four (4) Business Days prior written notice to Parent, which notice shall
include the information with respect to any such events, changes, effects,
developments, conditions or occurrences; (y) during such four (4) Business Day
period described in clause (x), the Company negotiates in good faith with
Parent and its Representatives, if requested by Parent, regarding any
adjustments or modifications to the terms of this Agreement; and (z) at the
end of the four (4) Business Day period described in clause (x), the Company
Board or applicable committee



determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel
(after taking into account any adjustments or modifications to the terms of
this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent during the period described in
clause (x)) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable laws.

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof),
directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from disclosing to the
Company's shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or making
any other disclosure to its shareholders, in each case in connection with a
Company Takeover Proposal, if the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has
determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
do so would be inconsistent with applicable law; provided, however, that any
such disclosure that constitutes or has the effect of a Company Change of
Recommendation shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 4.02 with
respect thereto (it being understood, however, that the disclosure of a "stop,
look and listen" notice of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act in and of itself shall not be deemed a Company Change
of Recommendation).

(h) The parties agree that a Company Change of Recommendation effected in
accordance with Section 4.02(e) or Section 4.02(f) shall not in and of itself
violate any other provision of this Agreement.

Section 4.03 Other Actions. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, including Section 5.03, the Company and Parent shall cooperate
with each other and use (and shall cause their respective subsidiaries and
controlled affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take
or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its (or their) part under this
Agreement and applicable law to (i) consummate and make effective the Merger
as soon as practicable and (ii) cause the satisfaction of all conditions set
forth in Article VI.

Section 4.04 Financing.

(a) Efforts to Obtain the Financing.

(i) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the
Financing on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
described in the Financing Commitments, including using (and causing its
controlled affiliates to use) reasonable best efforts (A) to maintain in
effect the Debt Financing Commitments in accordance with their terms, (B) to
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing Commitments on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) contained in the Debt Financing Commitments or, if available, on
other terms that are no less favorable, when taken as a whole (as determined
by Parent and Merger Sub), to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) in the Debt Financing Commitments
and would not adversely affect (including with respect to timing, taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) the



ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
herein, (C) to satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the expected
timing of the Marketing Period) all terms and conditions to funding in the
Debt Financing Commitments and such definitive agreements in respect thereof
within their control (other than any condition where the failure to be so
satisfied is a direct result of the Company's failure to furnish information
described in this Section 4.04) and in the Equity Financing Commitment, (D) to
fully pay when due any and all commitment fees or other fees or amounts
payable under the Financing Commitments and (E) to enforce their contractual
rights under the Debt Financing Commitments, including using reasonable best
efforts to cause the lenders thereunder to fund the Debt Financing at Closing.

(ii) Neither Parent nor its controlled affiliates shall agree to any
amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or
other provision or remedy under the Financing Commitments without the prior
written consent of the Company to the extent such amendments, modifications or
waivers would reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the aggregate amount of
cash proceeds available from the Financing to fund the amounts required to be
paid by Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement below the amount required to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (B) impose new or additional conditions under the Financing
Commitments or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions under
the Financing Commitments in a manner that would, in either case, reasonably
be likely to prevent or delay or impair the ability of Parent to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (C)
materially adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights under
the Financing Commitments, (D) prevent or materially delay the Closing or (E)
make the funding of the Debt Financing materially less likely to occur.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, Parent
may terminate, replace, supplement, amend, change or modify the Debt Financing
Commitments, the Equity Financing Commitment and the Limited Guarantee (1) in
the case of the Debt Financing Commitments, to add or change lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities, in each case
in accordance with the Debt Financing Commitments, and (2) in the case of the
Equity Financing Commitment or the Limited Guarantee, to add or change equity
financing sources and Guarantors (each, a "New Equity Financing Source"), so
long as (x) in the case of this clause (2), the amount of the Equity
Commitment (as defined in the Equity Financing Commitment) to be contributed
by all New Equity Financing Sources shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the
amount set forth in Section 4.04(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter and
each New Equity Financing Source shall be a bona fide entity with cash or cash
equivalents equal to or in excess of its pro rata share of the Equity
Commitment (as defined in the Equity Financing Commitment) or the contractual
right to call upon such cash or cash equivalents and (y) in the cases of
clauses (1) and (2), any such termination, replacement, supplementation,
amendment, change or modification (I) complies with the terms of this
Agreement and the then-existing Financing Commitments (as they may have been
so amended) and (II) does not adversely impact the ability of Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise
prevent or materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Any reference in this Agreement to the
"Equity Financing Commitment" or the "Limited Guarantee" shall include the
Equity Financing Commitment or the Limited Guarantee, as the case may be, as
replaced, supplemented, amended, changed or modified in accordance with this
Section 4.04(a)(ii), and any reference in this Agreement to a "Guarantor"
shall include any New Equity Financing Source that has been added or
substituted in accordance with this Section 4.04(a)(ii). For the avoidance of
doubt, a Guarantor shall be released from and



shall have no further liability or obligation to any member of the Parent
Group or any member of the Company Group with respect to that portion of (xx)
its pro rata share of the Equity Commitment (as defined in the Equity
Financing Commitment) and (yy) its pro rata portion of the Guaranteed
Obligations (as defined in the Limited Guarantee), in each case that has been
transferred to and/or assumed by a New Equity Financing Source pursuant to
this Section 4.04(a)(ii). Upon any replacement, supplementation, amendment,
change or modification to the Equity Financing Commitment or the Limited
Guarantee in accordance with this Section 4.04(a)(ii) that has the effect of
substituting a New Equity Financing Source for an existing Guarantor in its
entirety, any Guarantor so substituted shall be released from and shall have
no further liability or obligation with respect to this Agreement, the Equity
Financing Commitment, the Limited Guarantee or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, or otherwise, to any member of the Parent Group or any
member of the Company Group. Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company
prompt notice (aa) of any waiver, amendment or modification of the Financing
Commitments or the Limited Guarantee or any actual or alleged breach or
default by any party to any of the Financing Commitments or the Limited
Guarantee, in each case of which Parent or Merger Sub is aware, (bb) of the
receipt of (xxx) any written notice or (yyy) any other written communication,
in each case from any Financing Source with respect to any (AA) actual or
alleged breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of the
Financing Commitments or any definitive document related to the Financing or
(BB) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any of
the Financing Commitments with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing
or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing, in each case which
would make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) materially less likely to occur or
materially delay the availability of the Debt Financing, and (cc) if for any
reason Parent or Merger Sub determine in good faith that it will not be able
to obtain all or any portion of the Financing prior to the Termination Date.
As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any
material information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (aa), (bb) or (cc) of the immediately
preceding sentence. Upon the occurrence of any circumstance referred to in
clause (aa), (bb) or (cc) of the second preceding sentence or if any portion
of the Debt Financing otherwise becomes unavailable, and such portion is
reasonably required to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration and all fees,
expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to promptly arrange and obtain in
replacement thereof alternative financing from alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on terms and conditions not less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub
(in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than the terms set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitments (including the flex provisions thereof). Any reference
in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall include any such alternative
financing, any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing Commitments"
shall include the commitment letter and the corresponding fee letter with
respect to any such alternative financing, and any reference in this Agreement
to the "Debt Financing Sources" shall include the financing institutions
contemplated to provide any such alternative financing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent
or Merger Sub be required to pay any fees or any interest rates applicable to
the Debt Financing in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments (including the flex provisions), or agree to any "market flex"
term less favorable to Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation than



such corresponding market flex term contained in or contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments (in either case, whether to secure waiver of any
conditions contained therein or otherwise). Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a prompt basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts
to arrange the Financing and shall promptly provide to the Company copies of
all alternative financing commitments and related fee letters, redacted to the
same extent as copies of the Debt Financing Commitments delivered by Parent on
or prior to the date hereof.

(b) Financing Cooperation. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause
each of its subsidiaries and controlled Company Joint Ventures to use its
reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its Representatives, including legal and accounting advisors, and
controlled Company Joint Ventures to provide, in each case at Parent's sole
expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub that is
necessary or advisable in connection with arranging, obtaining and syndicating
the Financing and causing the conditions in the Financing Commitments to be
satisfied, including using reasonable best efforts in:

(i) assisting with the preparation of Offering Documents,

(ii) preparing and furnishing to Parent and the Debt Financing Sources as
promptly as practicable all Required Information and all other pertinent
information and disclosures relating to the Company and its subsidiaries
(including their businesses, operations, financial projections and prospects)
as may be reasonably requested by Parent and customary to assist in
preparation of the Offering Documents,

(iii) having the Company designate members of senior management of the Company
to execute customary authorization letters with respect to Offering Documents
and participate in a reasonable number of presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with ratings agencies in
connection with the Financing, including direct contact between such senior
management of the Company and its subsidiaries and the Financing Sources and
other potential lenders in the Financing,

(iv) assisting Parent in obtaining any corporate credit and family ratings
from any ratings agencies contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments,

(v) requesting the Company's independent auditors to cooperate with Parent's
reasonable best efforts to obtain customary accountant's comfort letters
(including "negative assurance") and consents from the Company's independent
auditors,

(vi) assisting in the preparation of, and executing and delivering, as of the
Closing, definitive financing documents, including guarantee and collateral
documents and customary closing certificates as may be reasonably required in
connection with the Financing (including a certificate of an appropriate
officer of the Company with respect to solvency of the Company and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis to the extent required by the Debt
Financing Sources) and other customary documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent,

(vii) facilitating the pledging of collateral for the Financing,



(viii) assisting the Financing Sources in benefiting from the existing lending
relationships of the Company and its subsidiaries,

(ix) requesting from the Company's existing lenders such customary documents
in connection with refinancings as reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Financing and collateral arrangements, including customary
payoff letters, lien releases, instruments of termination or discharge,

(x) furnishing Parent and the Debt Financing Sources with all documentation
and other information required by Governmental Authorities with respect to the
Debt Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the Uniting and Strengthening America by
Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act
of 2001, as amended, and

(xi) cooperating with Parent to the extent within the control of the Company
and its subsidiaries, and taking all corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the
consummation of the Financing;

provided, however, that (A) nothing in this Section 4.04(b) shall require such
cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of the Company or its subsidiaries, (B) neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries shall be required to commit to take any action relating to
the Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry
into any agreement) or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time
(or, without limitation of the foregoing, execute any definitive financing
documents (except the authorization letter delivered pursuant to the foregoing
clause (iii) prior to the Closing, or any other agreement, certificate,
document or instrument that would be effective prior to the Closing), or incur
any other liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection
with the Financing, in each case that is not subject to the occurrence of the
Closing), (C) none of the Company Board or board of directors (or equivalent
bodies) of any of the Company's subsidiaries shall be required to adopt or
enter into any resolutions or take similar action approving the Financing
(except that concurrently with the Closing the boards (or their equivalent
bodies) of subsidiaries of the Company may adopt resolutions or take similar
actions that do not become effective until the Effective Time) and (D) that
would reasonably be expected to cause any director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to incur any personal liability relating to
the Financing. The Company and its outside legal counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any private confidential
information memoranda or similar documents, or any materials for rating
agencies, in each case, prepared after the date hereof, that include
information about the Company or any of its subsidiaries prepared in
connection with the Debt Financing. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, its subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by
any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing (including any
action taken in accordance with this Section 4.04(b) and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than historical information relating
to the Company or its subsidiaries provided in writing by the Company or its
subsidiaries), except to the extent such losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interests, awards, judgments and penalties arise from the Company's
or any subsidiaries' gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.



Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company or its subsidiaries in connection
with this Section 4.04(b)).



(c) Current Information. The Company hereby consents to the use of the
Company's logos in connection with the Financing in a form and manner mutually
agreed with the Company; provided, however, that such logos are used solely in
a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries. In connection with any Offering Document
prepared by Parent and used to market any debt securities contemplated
pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitments prior to the Closing, the Company
will, upon request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to periodically
update any Required Information included in such Offering Document so that
such Required Information does not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.04 or otherwise shall require the
Company to issue any securities or become an obligor with respect to the Debt
Financing prior to the Closing.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing,
or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing.

ARTICLE V

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



Section 5.01 Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall prepare a preliminary Proxy Statement and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such preliminary Proxy Statement to be filed
with the SEC within twenty (20) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement. The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act. Parent shall
cooperate with the Company in the preparation and filing of the Proxy
Statement, and shall furnish all information concerning it that is necessary
in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and is reasonably
requested by the Company. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after
such filing and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's shareholders as promptly as
practicable after the date that the Company learns the Proxy Statement will
not be reviewed by the SEC staff or that the SEC staff has no further comments
thereon. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other
required documents (or in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response (including by participating in any substantive
discussions or meetings with the SEC) and shall give good faith consideration
to any comments made by Parent and its counsel. The Company



will notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and will provide Parent
with copies of all correspondence between the Company and the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) If, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that such document would not include any untrue of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
as promptly as practicable notify the other party and an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC as
promptly as practicable after the other party has had a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by applicable law,
disseminated to the Company's shareholders.

(c) The Company shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its shareholders, to be held as promptly as practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Company's shareholders in
accordance with Section 5.01(a) (the "Company Shareholders Meeting"), for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and any other matters
required under applicable law and the NYSE rules and regulations to be
considered at the Company Shareholders Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if on a date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, the
Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares to
constitute a quorum and to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, whether or
not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Shareholders Meeting
solely for the purpose of and for the minimum amount of time necessary to
obtain such a quorum or to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval; provided,
that, without Parent's express written consent, the Company shall not postpone
or adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting to a date that is more than thirty
(30) days after the date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting was
originally scheduled and in no event later than five (5) Business Days prior
to the Termination Date, in each case after taking into account all
postponements and/or adjournments. Notwithstanding any Company Change of
Recommendation, the Company Board shall present this Agreement for approval at
the Company Shareholders Meeting. At the Company Shareholders Meeting, unless
there shall have been a Company Change of Recommendation in accordance with
Section 4.02(e) or Section 4.02(f), the Company Board will make the Company
Recommendation, and the Company will, unless there has been a Company Change
of Recommendation, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
shareholders proxies in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and to take
all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Shareholder
Approval.

(d) If requested by Parent, the Company shall promptly conduct a "broker
search" as contemplated by and in accordance with Rule 14a-13 promulgated
under the Exchange Act with respect to the Company Shareholders Meeting (based
on a record date that is



the shortest number of days permitted under applicable law and the Company's
organizational documents). If at any time the current record date for the
Company Shareholders Meeting is not reasonably likely to satisfy the
requirements of applicable law and the Company's organizational documents, the
Company shall set a new record date mutually determined by Parent and the
Company and shall continue to comply with the "broker search" requirements of
Rule 14a-13 promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to any such new
record date.

Section 5.02 Access to Information; Confidentiality; Effect of Review.

(a) Access. From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective
Representatives to: (i) provide to Parent and Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business
conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, upon prior written notice
to the Company, to the officers, employees, auditors, properties, offices and
other facilities of the Company and its subsidiaries and to the books and
records thereof; (ii) furnish promptly to Parent and Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives such information concerning the business,
properties, contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and its
subsidiaries as Parent and Merger Sub or their respective Representatives may
reasonably request; and (iii) to the extent permitted by law, furnish promptly
to Parent each report, schedule and other document filed or received by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities or regulatory laws or filed with or sent to the SEC, FERC,
the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission or any other
Governmental Authority; provided that the foregoing shall not require the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or Representatives to furnish any such
materials that are otherwise publicly available; provided, further, that the
Company shall not be required to (or to cause any of its subsidiaries to)
afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the Company
believes in good faith that doing so would: (A) result in a loss of attorney-
client privilege or work-product protection; (B) violate any obligations of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect to confidentiality to any
third party or otherwise breach, contravene or violate any then effective
Contract to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party; or (C)
breach, contravene, or violate any applicable law (including the HSR Act or
any other antitrust or competition law); provided, further, that the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents of third
parties that are necessary to allow such information to be disclosed to
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives and shall otherwise
use commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in
a manner that does not result in a breach of clauses (A), (B) or (C)
(including pursuant to the use of "clean room" arrangements pursuant to which
Representatives of Parent could be provided access to such information).

(b) All information provided pursuant to Section 5.02(a) shall be subject to
the applicable terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.03 Regulatory Matters; Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Regulatory Approvals. Each party hereto shall cooperate and promptly
prepare and file all necessary and appropriate documentation, to effect all
necessary and



advisable applications, notices, petitions and filings, and, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement including Section 5.03(b), shall use
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things in order to, (i) obtain all approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities, necessary or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Company Required Statutory Approvals and the Parent
Required Statutory Approvals, (ii) make all registrations and filings, and
thereafter, make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in
connection therewith, with any Governmental Authority or other persons
necessary or advisable in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) seek
to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order which may
adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case until the issuance of a final, non-
appealable order with respect thereto, and (v) execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(b) Reasonable Best Efforts. In furtherance of the obligations set forth in
Section 5.03(a), but subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including this Section 5.03(b), each party agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take (and to cause its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates to
take) promptly any and all actions and promptly make any and all undertakings
necessary to obtain the Company Required Statutory Approvals and the Parent
Required Statutory Approvals so as to enable the parties to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable,
including by (i) accepting terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations,
commitments or sanctions or proposing, negotiating, agreeing or committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, license, disposition or limitation on usage of any business,
product line, properties, license, right, operations or assets of Parent or
its subsidiaries or of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective subsidiaries, (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that after the Closing would limit Parent's or its subsidiaries'
(including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation's) freedom of action
with respect to, or its or their ability to retain, one or more of its or its
subsidiaries' (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation's)
businesses, product lines, properties, licenses, rights, operations or assets,
(iii) taking or committing to take actions to maintain the credit rating of
Cleco Power at investment grade levels, (iv) accepting financial restrictions
on Parent or its subsidiaries or on the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
their respective subsidiaries and (v) accepting governance and operational
restrictions, including restrictions on the ability to change rates or charges
or standards of service or the scope of the business of Parent or its
subsidiaries or of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
subsidiaries and taking or committing to take actions related to customary
"ring-fencing" at Cleco Power; provided that, except with respect to the
liabilities, obligations and commitments of each Guarantor under the Equity
Financing Commitment and the Limited Guarantee, Parent shall not be required
to take any action or make any undertaking, or commit to take any action or
make any undertaking, including accepting any term, condition, liability,
obligation, commitment or sanction, that would impose any undertaking, term,
condition, liability, obligation, commitment or sanction on any Guarantor or
any affiliate of or any entity in which such Guarantor directly or indirectly
owns any equity



interests (other than Parent or its subsidiaries). Notwithstanding the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.03(b), nothing herein shall require
(and reasonable best efforts shall in no event require) any party or its
subsidiaries or affiliates to agree to or take any action, including any
action of the type described above in clauses (i) through (v), make any
undertaking or agree to any term, condition, liability, obligation, commitment
or sanction in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that, individually or in the aggregate,
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a Burdensome Effect.
A "Burdensome Effect" shall mean any terms, conditions, liabilities,
obligations, commitments or sanctions imposed upon or otherwise affecting,
directly or indirectly, Parent, the Company, their respective subsidiaries,
any direct or indirect owner of Parent, or any Company Joint Venture (A) in
any order or Consent of a Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Required Regulatory
Approvals, or (B) under any Merger Law that, in the case of either clause (A)
or clause (B), individually or in the aggregate, has had or would be
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the condition
(financial or otherwise), assets, liabilities, businesses or results of
operations of (1) the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2)
Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as whole (in the case of this clause (2),
after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement); provided, that for the purpose of determining whether a
Burdensome Effect has occurred or would be reasonably likely to occur, the
Company and its subsidiaries, in the aggregate, shall be deemed to have the
assets, liabilities, businesses and results of operations of a hypothetical
company that has 50% of the aggregate assets, liabilities, businesses and
results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries; and provided,
further, that any such terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations,
commitments or sanctions shall not be taken into account in determining
whether a Burdensome Effect has occurred or would be reasonably likely to
occur to the extent they implement any Regulatory Commitments. Neither Parent
nor Merger Sub, directly or indirectly through one or more of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates, shall acquire any regulated electric or gas
distribution utility in the State of Louisiana, other than pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that would reasonably be expected
to cause a material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions contained in
Article VI or the consummation of the Merger.

(c) Nothing in this Section 5.03 shall obligate Parent or the Company or any
of their respective subsidiaries to take any action that is not conditioned on
the Closing.

(d) The Company and Parent agree (i) that the applications submitted to FERC
and the LPSC with respect to the Merger shall include the information
concerning the Merger, the Company and its subsidiaries, and Parent required
by applicable laws of the State of Louisiana and such other jurisdictions as
may be mutually determined by the Company and Parent, (ii) that such
applications and any amendments or supplements thereto shall include the
Regulatory Commitments to the extent applicable to such jurisdictions and such
additional agreements or commitments as the Company and Parent agree are
advisable to obtain prompt approval of such applications, and (iii) that,
subject to compliance by each party with its obligations under Section 5.03(a)
and Section 5.03(b), neither the Company nor Parent shall agree to, or accept,
any additional or different agreements, commitments or conditions in
connection with the Merger pursuant to any settlement or otherwise with the
LPSC or any other Governmental Authority, in the case of any agreement,
commitment or condition to which the Company of any of its subsidiaries is a
party or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its



subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of Parent, and in the case of
any agreement, commitment or condition to which Parent is a party and
affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries, without the prior written
consent of the Company if such agreement, commitment or condition is effective
prior to the Effective Time.

(e) Unless prohibited by applicable law or by the applicable Governmental
Authority, (i) to the extent reasonably practicable, neither Parent, Merger
Sub nor the Company shall participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in
any substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority (including any
member of any Governmental Authority's staff) in respect of this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
with respect to any of the actions referred to in Section 5.03(a) or Section
5.03(b)) without the other, (ii) to the extent reasonably practicable, each of
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall give the other party reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or
conversation, (iii) in the event (A) Parent or (B) the Company is prohibited
by applicable law or by the applicable Governmental Authority from
participating in or attending any such meeting or engaging in any such
conversation, the Company (in the event of (A)) or Parent (in the event of
(B)) shall keep such other party reasonably apprised with respect thereto,
(iv) the parties shall cooperate in the filing of any substantive memoranda,
white papers, filings, correspondence or other written communications
explaining or defending this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated herein, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument or
responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Authority and
(v) to the extent reasonably practicable, each party shall furnish the other
party with copies of all substantive correspondence, filings and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and its subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective Representatives, on
the one hand, and any Governmental Authority (including any member of any
Governmental Authority's staff), on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated herein.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.03 to the contrary, the Company
and Parent shall cooperate and work jointly in the preparation and filing of
any related applications, filings or other materials with any Governmental
Authority (including the LPSC) and, to the extent reasonably practicable, (i)
in all communications with such Governmental Authority, (ii) for scheduling
and conducting any meeting with such Governmental Authority, (iii) for
coordinating and making any applications and filings with, and resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of, such Governmental Authority, and (iv) for
the purpose of obtaining the Parent Required Statutory Approvals, the Company
Required Statutory Approvals or any other Consents required of any
Governmental Authorities in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, in each case, that
the Company and Parent, as applicable, shall consult with the other party
reasonably in advance of taking any such action. Each party shall notify the
other party promptly of (A) any notice or other communication from any person
alleging that such person's Consent is or may be required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (C) any actions, suits,
claims, litigations, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to its
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries that,
in any such case, relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the



other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than litigation
covered by Section 5.08).

(g) Parent hereby recognizes and acknowledges that the Company is subject to
the plenary jurisdiction and regulatory authority of the LPSC and also is
subject to the jurisdiction and regulatory authority of the FERC and that the
Company's business operations that are subject to the jurisdictions of the
LPSC and FERC are ongoing and are contemplated to continue to be ongoing
before and after the Effective Time and regardless of whether or not the
Merger is consummated. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5.03, nothing in this Section 5.03 is intended to, or has the meaning
and purpose of, preventing in any way or degree the Company's normal and
ordinary practices and abilities to meet with or have conversations with the
LPSC and FERC concerning the Company's ongoing operations that are subject to
the LPSC's or the FERC's jurisdictions, respectively. Parent hereby recognizes
and acknowledges that the Company, in the normal and ordinary course and scope
of its meetings and conversations with the LPSC and FERC concerning the
Company's ongoing operations, may find it also appropriate to discuss the
Merger (including, without limitation, responding to inquiries as to the
potential effects of the Merger on the ongoing operations under discussion),
without Parent being present and participating in such discussions, at all
times consistent with the obligation of the Company under this Section 5.03 to
use its reasonable best efforts to take (and to cause its subsidiaries and
controlled affiliates to take) promptly any and all actions and promptly make
any and all undertakings necessary to obtain the Company Required Statutory
Approvals and the Parent Required Statutory Approvals so as to enable the
parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable. In the event of such discussions by the Company with the LPSC
or FERC, without Parent participating in such discussions, the Company
promptly thereafter shall reasonably apprise Parent of such discussions
concerning the Merger.

(h) Takeover Laws. Without limiting the generality of Section 5.03(b), the
Company and Parent shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no
Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any Takeover

Section 5.04 Employee Matters.

(a) Following the Effective Time and for a period ending on the second
anniversary of the Effective Time (the "Benefit Period"), Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to officers and employees of the
Company and its subsidiaries as of the Effective Time ("Affected Employees")
(i) an annual base salary and annual cash incentive compensation opportunities
that are no less favorable than the annual base salary and annual cash
incentive compensation opportunities provided to such Affected Employees under
the Company Employee Benefit Plans listed on Section 3.01(l)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) other
employee benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate



to the other employee benefits provided to such Affected Employees under the
Company Employee Benefit Plans listed on Section 3.01(l)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) For purposes of participation, vesting and level of vacation or severance
benefits (but not for benefit accrual purposes), and eligibility to
participate under the employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent
and its subsidiaries providing benefits to any Affected Employee during the
Benefit Period (including the Company Employee Benefit Plans) (the "New
Plans"), each Affected Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent and for the same
purpose as such Affected Employee was entitled, immediately before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Employee
Benefit Plan in which such Affected Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that such
service credit shall not be provided (i) under any defined benefit pension
plans or retiree medical plans or programs of Parent and its affiliates or
with respect to the level of allocations to any retirement plans of Parent and
its affiliates, or (ii) if it would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the
Benefit Period Parent shall cause (A) each Affected Employee to be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under
a Company Employee Benefit Plan in which such Affected Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old
Plans"), and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Affected Employee, any evidence
of insurability requirements, all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plans to be waived for such Affected
Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were
inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plan. During the Benefit
Period, Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Affected
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such Affected Employee's participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Affected Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year; provided that such amount was
taken into account for the same purpose under the similar Company Employee
Benefit Plan for such period and would not result in the duplication of
benefits.

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and
honor the obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under all
employment, severance, consulting, retirement and other compensation contracts
between either the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
any current or former director, officer or employee thereof, on the other
hand, to the extent listed on Section 3.01(l)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, and all provisions for vested benefits or other vested amounts earned
or accrued through the Effective Time under the Company Employee Benefit
Plans, in accordance with their terms as in effect on the date hereof;
provided that this shall not prohibit amendments or terms in accordance with
the terms thereof or as set forth on Section 5.04(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.04 are solely for the benefit of the
parties



to this Agreement and no current or former employee, officer, director or
independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an amendment to any Company
Employee Benefit Plan, New Plan or other employee benefit plan for any
purpose. No provision of this Agreement shall create any right in any employee
or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to continued employment
by Parent or any of its affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, or
preclude the ability of Parent or any of its affiliates, including the
Surviving Corporation, to terminate the employment of any employee or officer
for any reason.

Section 5.05 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors and officers, and the fiduciaries currently
indemnified under benefit plans of the Company and its subsidiaries, as
provided in their respective certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws
(or comparable organizational documents) or other agreements providing
indemnification, advancement or exculpation, shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and
that for six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, no such provision in
any certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws (or comparable
organizational document) or other agreement shall be amended, modified or
repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections
thereunder to any such individual with respect to acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to honor and
perform, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants
contained in this Section 5.05.

(b) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the directors' and officers'
liability (and fiduciary) insurance policies currently maintained by the
Company covering acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the Company's
respective directors' and officers' liability (and fiduciary) insurance
policies on terms with respect to such coverage and in amounts no less
favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties than those set forth in the
relevant policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided that the
annual cost thereof shall not exceed 300% of the annual cost of such policies
as of the date hereof. If such insurance coverage cannot be maintained for
such cost, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors'
and officers' insurance otherwise obtainable for such cost. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on
terms and conditions no less favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties than
the existing directors' and officers' liability (and fiduciary) insurance
maintained by the Company, covering without limitation the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided that the aggregate cost thereof shall not exceed
600% of the annual cost of the directors' and officers' liability (and
fiduciary) insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof. If such
"tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, it shall satisfy the obligations set forth in the first two sentences of
this paragraph (b).



(c) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present
director and officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (in each case,
for acts or failures to act in such capacity), determined as of the date
hereof, and any person who becomes such a director or officer between the date
hereof and the Effective Time (collectively, the "Company Indemnified
Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees, costs and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, amounts paid in
settlement, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or relating to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to also advance expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees, costs and expenses) to such persons as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law; provided that the person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification).

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
5.05 shall not be terminated or modified by such parties in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party, or any other person entitled
to the benefit of Section 5.05(a) and Section 5.05(b), as the case may be, to
whom this Section 5.05 applies without the consent of the affected Company
Indemnified Party, or such other person, as the case may be. If Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each
such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all
of the obligations of Parent, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, set forth in this Section 5.05.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.05 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and, from and after the Effective Time, will be enforceable by, each of
the Company Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and personal
representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for or in
limitation of, any other rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses,
exculpation or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise.

Section 5.06 Fees and Expenses. Except as provided in this Section 5.06,
Section 7.03 and Section 7.04, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not the Merger is consummated, except that each of the Company and Parent
shall each bear and pay one-half of the costs and expenses (other than
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with (a) the filing,
printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement (including SEC filing fees), (b)
the filings of the premerger notification and report forms under the HSR Act
(including filing fees) and (c) the preparation and filing of all
applications, filings or other materials with the LPSC. The Surviving
Corporation shall file any return with respect to, and shall pay, any state or
local Taxes (including penalties or interest with respect thereto), if any,
that are attributable to (i) the transfer of the beneficial ownership of the



Company's real property and (ii) the transfer of Company Common Stock pursuant
to this Agreement as a result of the Merger. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate with respect to the filing of such returns, including supplying any
information that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns.

Section 5.07 Public Announcements. The Company and Parent will consult with
each other before issuing, and provide each other the reasonable opportunity
to review, comment upon and concur with, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except (a) as the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, after consultation with outside counsel,
determines is required by applicable law or applicable rule or regulation of
the NYSE (in which case, the party required to issue or make such press
release or announcement shall give reasonable notice to the other party,
including the opportunity to review or comment on such press release or
announcement to the extent reasonably practicable) or (b) in connection with a
Company Change of Recommendation.

Section 5.08 Shareholder Litigation. In the event that any shareholder
litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is brought, or to the Company's knowledge,
threatened in writing, against the Company and/or the members of the Company
Board after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (the
"Transaction Litigation"), the Company shall promptly notify Parent of any
such Transaction Litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with
respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation, and
the Company shall not settle, compromise, come to an arrangement regarding or
agree to settle, compromise or come to an arrangement regarding any
Transaction Litigation, without Parent's prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Section 5.09 Agreements Concerning Merger Sub. Parent hereby guarantees the
due, prompt and faithful payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub of,
and the compliance by Merger Sub with, all of the covenants, agreements,
obligations and undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and covenants and agrees to take all actions
necessary or advisable to ensure such payment, performance and discharge by
Merger Sub hereunder. Parent shall, promptly following execution of this
Agreement, cause the sole shareholder of Merger Sub to approve this Agreement
in its capacity as sole shareholder of Merger Sub and deliver to the Company
evidence of its vote or action by written consent approving this Agreement in
accordance with applicable law and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of
Merger Sub. During the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub
to, engage in any activity of any nature except as contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 5.10 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall

covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
("Section 16") of Shares or other equity interest in the Company (including
Company



Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units) pursuant to this Agreement and
the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

Section 5.11 Notices of Certain Events. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify the other in writing of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence,
of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any party hereto to
effect the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied or (b) the failure of any such party to comply
with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it pursuant to this Agreement which, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Merger not to be satisfied. The delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall not cure any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement requiring disclosure of such matter prior to
the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to any party.

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 7.03 do
not constitute a penalty but constitute payment of liquidated damages and that
the Company's liquidated damages amount is reasonable in light of the
substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused by Parent's and
Merger Sub's breach or default under this Agreement, the difficulty of proof
of loss and damages, the inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise
obtaining an adequate remedy, and the value of the transactions to be
consummated hereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing, if the Company fails
to pay promptly any fee payable by it pursuant to this Section 7.03, then the
Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees)
in connection with collecting such fee, together with interest on the amount
of the fee at the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal from the
date such payment was due under this Agreement until the date of payment.

Section 7.04 Parent Termination Fee.

(a) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to (A) Section
7.01(e) due to a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of Section 3.02(g), Section
4.04(a) or Section 5.03 which (1) in the case of such a breach of Section
3.02(g) or Section 4.04(a), has resulted in the Debt Financing (including any
alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance with, and satisfies
the conditions of, Section 4.04(a)) not being funded or not being



able to be funded on the terms set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments or
(2) in the case of such a breach of Section 5.03, has resulted in the failure
of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01(b) or Section 6.01(c) to be
satisfied or to be capable of being satisfied or (B) Section 7.01(i), or (ii)
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(c) and at the time
of such termination the Company would have been entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(e) or Section 7.01(i) solely under the
circumstances described in Section 7.04(a)(i), then, in the case of either
clause (i) or (ii), Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company a fee
(the "Parent Termination Fee") in cash equal to $180,000,000 by wire transfer
of immediately available funds (x) in the case of clause (i), within three (3)
Business Days following delivery of the Company's notice of termination, and
(y) in the case of clause (ii), within three (3) Business Days following
delivery of Parent's notice of termination, it being understood that in no
event shall Parent be required to pay or cause to be paid the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(b) None of (i) Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) the former, current or future
holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys,
affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or
assignees of Parent or Merger Sub or any Guarantor, or (iii) any lender,
prospective lender, arranger or agent of or under the Financing or any of
their respective former, current or future equityholders, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, affiliates, managers or agents (collectively,
the "Financing Sources") (the Persons described in clauses (i), (ii), and
(iii) shall be collectively referred to as the "Parent Group") shall, in the
case of clause (i) and (ii) above only (but not, for the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to any Debt Financing Sources), upon full payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, have any further liability with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Financing) to any member
of the Company Group or any other person (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise), and neither the Company nor any other person
(including any other member of the Company Group) shall have any claim or
recourse against any member of the Parent Group as a result of the breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub,
as applicable, contained herein or otherwise arising out of or in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Financing). Without limiting the foregoing, following a termination of this
Agreement in any circumstance that shall entitle the Company to payment of the
Parent Termination Fee, in no event shall (A) the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, or (B) any former, current or future, direct or indirect,
stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, representative, affiliate or
assignee of any of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the persons
described in clauses (A) and (B) shall be collectively referred to as the
"Company Group") seek, or permit to be sought, on behalf of any member of the
Company Group, any monetary damages from, or any other recourse or remedy
from, any member of the Parent Group in connection with this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Financing), other than
(without duplication) payment of the Parent Termination Fee as provided in
Section 7.04(a) and any expenses as provided in Section 7.04(d), and such
payment shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company Group in
such circumstance. The provisions of this Section 7.04(b) are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each member of the Parent
Group.

(c) Subject only to the Company's right to seek specific performance solely in
accordance with Section 8.11, the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and
Merger Sub under



or relating to this Agreement to any member of the Company Group or any other
person shall be limited to the amount of the Parent Termination Fee (the
"Parent Liability Limitation"), and in no event shall the Company or any of
its affiliates seek, obtain or accept, or permit to be sought (and no
liability shall attach to the any member of the Parent Group with respect to),
any recovery, judgment or damages of any kind, including consequential,
indirect or punitive damages, under or in connection with this Agreement, the
Financing Commitments or the Limited Guarantee or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, against Parent, Merger Sub, any Guarantor or
any other member of the Parent Group, whether by or through attempted piercing
of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or
through a claim by or on behalf of Parent against the Guarantors or any other
member of the Parent Group, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any
legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable law, or otherwise, other than against Parent or Merger Sub pursuant
to this Agreement or against a Guarantor pursuant to (and subject to the
terms, conditions and limitations of) the Limited Guarantee, in each such case
not to exceed, in the aggregate, the Parent Liability Limitation, and in no
event shall the Company and its affiliates be entitled to an aggregate amount
equal to more than the Parent Liability Limitation. While the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 8.11
and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under Section 7.04, under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance of Parent's obligation to consummate the Merger
and any money damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Termination
Fee.

(d) All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or
in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or
the negotiation, execution, performance or non-performance of this Agreement
(including any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) may be made by any
party hereto only against the persons that are expressly identified as parties
hereto. Without prejudice to the foregoing, no Debt Financing Source or any
affiliate thereof shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in
law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of
an entity party against its owners or affiliates) to any party to this
Agreement for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with
or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation or execution; and each party
hereto waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations
against any such Debt Financing Source or any affiliate thereof; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement,
including this Section 7.04(d), shall in any way limit or modify any rights,
claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in
equity) of Parent or Merger Sub that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to the Debt Financing or the Debt Financing Commitments or the negotiation,
execution, performance or non-performance thereof.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter
into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section
7.04 do not constitute a penalty but constitute payment of liquidated damages
and that the Company's liquidated damages amount is reasonable in light of the
substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused by Parent's and
Merger Sub's breach or default under this Agreement, the difficulty of proof
of loss and damages, the



inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy,
and the value of the transactions to be consummated hereunder. In furtherance
of the foregoing, if Parent fails to pay promptly any fee payable by it
pursuant to this Section 7.04, then Parent shall pay to the Company, its costs
and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with collecting such
fee, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate
published in the Wall Street Journal from the date such payment was due under
this Agreement until the date of payment

supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer, and does not confer, any
rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement (or any breach hereof)
on any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, except after the Effective Time (A) for the provisions
of Section 5.05 (which shall be enforceable by the Company Indemnified
Parties), and (B) for the rights of the Company's shareholders to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement in the event the Merger is
consummated. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
without notice or liability to any other person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the parties and may have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected
in the text of this Agreement. Accordingly, persons other than the parties may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of Sections 7.04(b), 7.04(c), 7.04(d), 8.07, 8.08, 8.09 and 8.13
and this Section 8.06 (and the definitions related thereto) shall be
enforceable by each Debt Financing Source (and each is an intended third party
beneficiary thereof).



Section 8.07 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that after receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, there shall not be made any amendment that by
law or in accordance with the rules or any relevant stock exchange, requires
further approval by the shareholders of the Company without the further
approval of such shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Sections 7.04(b), 7.04(c), 7.04(d),
8.06, 8.08, 8.09 and 8.13 and this Section 8.07 may not be modified or amended
in a manner that is adverse to a Debt Financing Source without the prior
written consent of such Debt Financing Source.

Section 8.08 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a
party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party or parties, (b) waive any breach or inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties of the other party or parties contained
in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or
(c) waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party; provided that no such extension to or waiver of Sections 7.04(b),
7.04(c), 7.04(d), 8.06, 8.07, 8.09 or 8.13 or this Section 8.08 that is
adverse to a Debt Financing Source shall be valid without the prior written
consent of such Debt Financing Source. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section 8.09 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws, except that matters
related to the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board shall be governed by
the laws of the State of Louisiana. No party hereto, nor any of its
affiliates, will bring, or support the bringing of, any claim, whether at law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Debt
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitments or the performance
thereof, anywhere other than in (i) any New York State court sitting in the
County of New York or (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York.

(b) Each of the parties (i) irrevocably submits itself to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the
extent such court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court
of the District of Delaware, as well as to the jurisdiction of all courts to
which an appeal may be taken from such courts, in any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated herein, (ii) agrees that every such suit, action or
proceeding shall be brought, heard and determined exclusively in such court,
(iii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court, (iv) agrees
not to bring any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein in any other court,
and (v) waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
suit, action or proceeding so brought.



(c) Each of the parties agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document in the manner set forth in Section 8.02 shall be effective service of
process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against it.

Section 8.10 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of Parent and Merger Sub may (a) assign any of its rights or delegate any
of its obligations under this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, to
one or more of its affiliates (but no such assignment or delegation shall
relieve the assigning or delegating party of any of its obligations hereunder)
and (b) collaterally assign any of its rights, but not its obligations, under
this Agreement to any of its Financing Sources. Any attempted or purported
assignment in violation of this Section 8.10 shall be null and void and of no
effect whatsoever. Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.10, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 8.11 Specific Performance.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage may occur and that the parties
may not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that,
subject to Section 8.11(b), in the event of any breach or threatened breach by
any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the
non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without the necessity of posting bonds or
similar undertakings in connection therewith, this being in addition to any
other remedy which may be available to such non-breaching party at law or in
equity, including monetary damages.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 8.11(a), it is explicitly agreed that the right of
the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedies with respect to enforcing Parent's obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded, and/or to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including to effect the Closing
in accordance with Section 1.02, on the terms and subject to the conditions in
this Agreement, shall be available if and only if (A) the Marketing Period has
ended, (B) all conditions in Section 6.01 and Section 6.03 were satisfied
(other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the
Closing (provided such conditions remain capable of being satisfied as of such
date)) at the time when the Closing would have occurred as required by Section
1.02 but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded on the terms set
forth in the Equity Financing Commitment and continue to be satisfied and
Parent and Merger Sub shall fail to complete the Closing by the date that the
Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 1.02, (C) the Debt Financing
(including any alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance
with, and satisfies the conditions of, Section 4.04(a)) has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing on the terms set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitments if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing on the terms set
forth in the Equity Financing Commitment and (D) the Company has confirmed in
writing to Parent that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are



funded on the terms set forth in the Equity Financing Commitment and the Debt
Financing Commitments, respectively, then the Company would take such actions
that are within its control to cause the Closing pursuant to Section 1.02 to
occur.

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that (x) the other parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or (y) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with this Section 8.11 shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, while a party may pursue both a grant of
specific performance in accordance with Section 8.11(b) and the payment of any
applicable termination fee, damages and/or expense reimbursement, as
applicable, under no circumstances shall any party be permitted or entitled to
receive both (i) a grant of specific performance and (ii) any applicable
termination fee, any expense reimbursement or any damages.

Section 8.12 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

Section 8.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party to this Agreement knowingly and
voluntarily waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any action, suit or
proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, any
dispute arising out of or relating to the Debt Financing Commitments or the
performance thereof or the Debt Financing.









IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized,
all as of the date first written above.
